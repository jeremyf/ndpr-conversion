	<p class="MsoBodyText">Of all the accomplishments in the history of philosophy over the past few decades, the recovery of Stoicism would have to rank among the most impressive.<span style="">  </span>From a state of relative neglect and uneven comprehension, it has become a central area of research in ancient philosophy, and widespread (though of course not universal) consensus has formed around the interpretation of its core doctrines.<span style="">  </span>The health of the field is indicated by a recent shift in the direction of research.<span style="">  </span>While scholars are still seeking to improve our understanding of the school itself, they have also begun to explore its external relations.<span style="">  </span>Those relations are numerous and of profound significance, giving us reason to believe that careful consideration of them will greatly enhance our knowledge of Stoicism in particular and the history of philosophy in general.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The essays collected in <i>Stoicism: Traditions and Transformations</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> constitute a major addition to this comparative project.<span style="">  </span>They can be seen as doing so on two levels:<span style="">  </span>first, by examining individual points of contact between Stoicism and other figures, eras or philosophical fields from ancient times to the present; second, in the process of examining those points of contact, by shedding light on what it is to be a Stoic.<span style="">  </span>Setting aside the introduction for the moment, the twelve chapters fall into four groups:<span style="">  </span>ancient, medieval, early modern and contemporary. In what follows, overviews are given by group; then, a brief global comment/criticism is provided by way of conclusion.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=";font-family:&quot;;" ><b> <o:p></o:p></b></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=";font-family:&quot;;" ><b>Ancient</b></span><b><o:p></o:p></b></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">"The Socratic Imprint on Epictetus' Philosophy" by A.A. Long is doubly appropriate as the first chapter in the volume, for not only does it deal with the earliest figure but also it is by the dean of modern Stoic scholarship.<span style="">  </span>Though Epictetus was a Stoic, he borrowed more from Socrates, his preferred philosopher, than his Stoic predecessors.<span style="">  </span>Long has studied some of Epictetus' debts to Socrates elsewhere; here, he treats the connections in their methodologies.<span style="">  </span>Assembling extensive texts and arguments, Long convinces this reader, at least, that Socrates' elenchus was the standard for philosophical practice that Epictetus strove to emulate in his own teaching and research.<span style="">  </span>When doing so, however, Epictetus adapted it to meet the demands of his system.<span style="">  </span>In keeping with Stoicism's emphasis on the responsibility that each person has for the state of her or his own soul, Epictetus encouraged students to "engage in dialogue with their individual selves and to use this as their principal instrument of moral progress" (23).</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The next paper in ancient, Steven K. Strange's "The Stoics on the Voluntariness of the Passions," is the only non-comparative chapter in the volume, restricting its scope to the important Stoic doctrine that our passions are up to us.<span style="">  </span>However counterintuitive it might seem -- passions seem to be at least partially things which happen to us, not the object of choice -- Strange reminds us that it is well-grounded in the Stoics' moral psychology.<span style="">  </span>If one thinks (as the Stoics did) that the soul is a fundamentally unified rational entity, so that all its powers and activities are to be explained in terms of the operations of reason, and if one thinks that an agent's reason is within his control, it will be quite natural for one to think that passions are within his control, too.<span style="">  </span>Though the basic argument will not be unfamiliar to students of Stoicism, Strange manages some novel and extremely interesting points along the way.<span style="">  </span>These include his interpretation of the Stoic analysis of akrasia (44-5) and his claim that impressions can sometimes force our assent (48).</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Following Strange, Troels Engberg-Pedersen's "Stoicism in the Apostle Paul:<span style="">  </span>A Philosophical Reading" wants to "show by a single example in what way it is correct to claim that Stoicism helps Paul formulate the goal of his theological thought" (55).<span style="">  </span>Engberg-Pedersen focuses on Galatians 5:13-26 as his main text, arguing (among other things) that the freedom which the Christian is supposed to experience when she aligns her will to God's is directly analogous to the freedom which the Stoic enjoys when he conforms himself to the rational order of Nature.<span style="">  </span>On the basis of this analysis, Engberg-Pedersen concludes that Paul is a "crypto-Stoic" (73), meaning that he was acquainted with and influenced by Stoic notions but for obvious religious reasons didn't want to admit it.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Brad Inwood's "Moral Judgment in Seneca" is next.<span style="">  </span>(Full disclosure:<span style="">  </span>Inwood and Normore were this reviewer's dissertation co-supervisors.)<span style="">  </span>Beginning with some interesting reflections on the nature of moral judgment -- among the conclusions here are that it "has not always been taken as a bland general synonym for moral decisions and that it need not be" (76) -- Inwood proceeds to consider Seneca's contribution to the formulation of the concept.<span style="">  </span>His take on the matter is nuanced.<span style="">  </span>On the one hand, he doubts that "Seneca invented the idea of moral judgment":<span style="">  </span>there are too many texts showing it existed prior to him (78).<span style="">  </span>On the other, he doesn't think Seneca's work is entirely irrelevant:<span style="">  </span>texts such as <i>On Anger</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>Ep.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 81 constitute "at least prima facie evidence that Seneca was self-consciously and creatively exploiting aspects of the (to him) familiar notion of a </span><i>iudex</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> [judge] as a guide to reflection on the kind of rationality appropriate to situations that call for moral decision making" (88).<span style="">  </span>Though experimental and hence preliminary, Seneca provides ample resources which later thinkers would utilize to articulate less-tentative models of moral evaluation and decision making. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">There is a double-entendre in the title of Richard Sorabji's "Stoic First Movements in Christianity":<span style="">  </span>first, it picks up the Stoic concept of the "pre-emotion" or "first (emotional) movement" (<i>propatheiai</i><span style="font-style: normal;">);<span style="">  </span>second, it refers to the impact of that concept on the earliest centuries of the Christian church.<span style="">  </span>In Stoicism, the pre-emotion is not a genuine emotion, because it does not involve an evaluative reaction by the agent; instead, it is the involuntary "jolt" which all humans experience upon the reception of certain powerful impressions.<span style="">  </span>To use an example from Seneca, "very often even the bravest man grows pale as he puts on his armor" (</span><i>On anger</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 2.3.3 (translated by Sorabji on 96)).<span style="">  </span>As Sorabji notes, the concept of the pre-emotion allows Stoics to set aside objections to their intellectualistic theory of emotions:<span style="">  </span>when their opponents contended that the brave man's pallor proves the non-cognitiveness of emotions, Stoics were able to deflect such criticisms on the grounds that such phenomena are but preludes to true emotions.<span style="">  </span>After a brief analysis of the concept itself, Sorabji marshals a fascinating array of texts to show how it was received by early Christian thinkers.<span style="">  </span>Though they completely changed its meaning -- in their hands, first emotions become first thoughts and specifically the first bad thoughts all of us have prior to sinning -- Sorabji thinks it would be a mistake to "condemn the misuse of the Stoic term" (106).<span style="">  </span>What we should concentrate on instead is "how fruitful it can be when one group of thinkers transforms the ideas of another group, in order to set them to new purposes" (106).</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=";font-family:&quot;;" ><b>Medieval</b></span><b><o:p></o:p></b></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Sten Ebbesen's "Where Were the Stoics in the Late Middle Ages?" marks the entry into medieval philosophy.<span style="">  </span>No sooner does he state his intriguing question than he gives its answer:<span style="">  </span>"everywhere and nowhere" (108).<span style="">  </span>Methodologically, Ebbesen finds in late medieval philosophy a "great community of spirits with the Stoics" (125).<span style="">  </span>This manifests itself in a zest for logic and conceptual analysis and an insistence on making the firm distinctions between philosophical notions that are required to formulate coherent theories of the world and our place in it.<span style="">  </span>Such is not, in Ebbesen's congenial words, "a sport for gentlemen"; while "[m]ost of Western history consists of gentlemen's centuries," scholastics and Stoics enthusiastically played the rough game (108).<span style="">  </span>Doctrinally, however, it seems that Stoics are nowhere.<span style="">  </span>Though it is true that hints of Stoicism can be discerned in various areas of scholastic thought, none more so than scholastic logic, close scrutiny of these apparent similarities usually reveals differences on important matters of detail.<span style="">  </span>Since the details matter when it comes to doctrinal affinity, Ebbesen concludes that Stoics were not important on this level.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Ebbesen's piece deliberately sets its sights wide;<span style="">  </span>Calvin Normore's "Abelard's Stoicism and Its Consequences" is the exact opposite.<span style="">  </span>Not only does Normore look at a single person but also he zooms in on "just one theme in Abelard's ethics":<span style="">  </span>his analysis of the specific location of responsibility (132).<span style="">  </span>In contrast to many of his contemporaries, Abelard denies that "the moral character of an act is an intrinsic feature of the particular act itself" (133).<span style="">  </span>Neither does he think that "the moral significance of an act [can] derive solely from . . .<span style="">  </span>the <i>voluntas</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> from which it is done either" (132).<span style="">  </span>Instead of the act or the will, Abelard makes "consent or intention the locus of moral responsibility" (141).<span style="">  </span>As Normore understands them, Abelard's notion of consent or intention is conceptually equivalent to the Stoics' notion of assent.<span style="">  </span>And just as Abelard identifies consent or intention as the bearer of all moral responsibility, so the Stoics did for assent.<span style="">  </span>In Normore's opinion, the isomorphism between Abelard and the Stoics is no accident.<span style="">  </span>For in Normore's opinion, Abelard is "deeply influenced by Stoic doctrine and is self-consciously taking up Stoic themes in his ethics" (143).<span style="">  </span>Normore concludes by arguing that "it is in virtue of Abelard's taking up [Stoic] themes that they remain part of the philosophical landscape in the later Middle Ages" (143).</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Early modern<o:p></o:p></b></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Whether in virtue of Abelard or someone else, Stoicism had become a dominant presence in philosophy by the dawn of the early modern era.<span style="">  </span>As one would expect, though, the Stoicism of c.1600 was substantially different from classical Stoicism, which is a key reason historians tend to call it "<i>Neo</i><span style="font-style: normal;">stoicism."<span style="">  </span>In "Constancy and Coherence," Jacqueline Lagrée tackles the job of determining "what specific effects Neostoicism had in the moral sphere" of that time (149).<span style="">  </span>To organize her inquiry, she probes how a central principle of Stoic ethics -- which she calls "constancy" -- resurfaced in early modern thought.<span style="">  </span>As Lagrée conceives of it, constancy is "less a particular virtue than something that colors all of the virtues . . .<span style="">  </span>[it is] a firm and stable disposition that results from [the soul's] agreement with nature" (150). Going through a number of important figures, including Lipsius, du Vair and others, Lagrée demonstrates both that constancy was of critical importance to their moral theories and that it became increasingly less Stoic (and more Christian) as time progressed.<span style="">  </span>The dissolution of the specifically Stoic aspects of constancy reflects a broader trend in early modern thought.<span style="">  </span>As Lagrée writes in her conclusion, "[a]fter the death of Lipsius and especially with the advent of the new and influential philosophical system of Descartes, modern stoicism ceases to be a true philosophy and becomes instead an ethical and then legal </span><i>attitude</i><span style="font-style: normal;">" (168).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Like Lagrée, Donald Rutherford is also interested in "the fate of Stoic ethics in the early modern period" (178).<span style="">  </span>In "On the Happy Life:<span style="">  </span>Descartes vis-ˆ-vis Seneca," he contrasts the two thinkers' conceptions of happiness.<span style="">  </span>Rutherford takes pains to emphasize a "striking commonality of purpose":<span style="">  </span>both take the "attainment of happiness" to be their "principal goal," and both think that philosophy "teaches us how to live happily" (193). <span style=""> </span>Without discounting this basic agreement -- indeed, it is more important to him than anything else -- Rutherford does raise some compelling differences.<span style="">  </span>Most importantly, Rutherford argues that unlike Seneca's, Descartes' ethics is not eudaimonistic.<span style="">  </span>Stoics such as Seneca think "the aim of ethical inquiry is to articulate the content of happiness, which is identified as our supreme good and final end" (182).<span style="">  </span>Not so, Descartes.<span style="">  </span>According to Rutherford, he disengages "the notion of happiness from that of the supreme good" and thereby "lays the foundations of a theory that is distinct" from Stoicism (182).<span style="">  </span>Descartes conceived of happiness as an affective state -- the satisfaction of mind that results from the possession of the supreme good.<span style="">  </span>As such, it is distinct from the supreme good per se, which is virtue and virtue alone.<span style="">  </span>The final end can be either of these, "for the supreme good is undoubtedly the thing we ought to set ourselves as the good of all our actions, and the resulting contentment of mind is also rightly called our end, since it is the attraction which makes us seek the supreme good" (181).</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">While Descartes' affinities with Stoicism have only recently been emphasized, scholars have long been impressed by the resemblance of Stoicism to Spinoza's philosophy.<span style="">  </span>It is somewhat ironic, then, that the Spinoza of Firmin DeBrabander's "Psychotherapy and Moral Perfection:<span style="">  </span>Spinoza and the Stoics on the Prospect of Happiness" appears much less Stoical than Rutherford's Descartes.<span style="">  </span>According to DeBrabander, Stoics and Spinoza agree on the objective of life, which is the conformity of the self to nature and the reigning in of those parts of the self which go beyond nature. However, DeBrabander thinks that Spinoza, for reasons which are at bottom naturalistic, disagreed with Stoics over the feasibility of this objective.<span style="">  </span>Stoics thought humans are capable of attaining complete control over their thoughts and actions and with that control came the possibility of complete happiness.<span style="">  </span>Spinoza had little patience with this:<span style="">  </span>in his view, the parameters of human control are narrowly fixed by the overwhelming natural forces enveloping them.<span style="">  </span>Given such impotence, the perfectionism which Stoic psychotheraphy tries to achieve is beyond any human's ability;<span style="">  </span>instead, "there is in the end a tragic element to Spinozistic ethics, since I am necessarily driven to an end that is futile" (211).</p>   <p class="MsoEndnoteText"><span style="font-family:Times;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=";font-family:&quot;;" ><b>Contemporary</b></span><b><o:p></o:p></b></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In "Duties of Justice, Duties of Material Aid:<span style="">  </span>Cicero's Problematic Legacy," Martha Nussbaum traces the hidden yet overwhelming influence exerted by Cicero's <i>De officiis</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> on Western views of international obligations.<span style="">  </span>As her title suggests, central to this influence is a distinction Cicero makes between two types of duties:<span style="">  </span>described in the broadest of terms, duties of justice are based on "an idea of respect for humanity, of treating a human being like an end rather than a means" (220), while duties of material aid derive from "the various degrees of association, beginning with the species as a whole, and the ties of reason and speech that link us all together" (223).<span style="">  </span>Corresponding to the different sources of the two types of duties is an important difference in the kind of obligation they place on us.<span style="">  </span>Just as the recognition of humanity is unequivocal and uniform across agents, so "[d]uties of justice are fully universal, and impose strict, exceptionless obligations" (222).<span style="">  </span>And just as degrees of association are greater-or-less -- my association with my family is greater than my association with someone I've never met in a country I've never heard of -- so "a great deal of latitude" is attached to duties of material aid (224).<span style="">  </span>Nussbaum argues that this distinction has been adopted by many in the history of the West -- she singles out Aquinas, Grotius and Kant as important examples -- and it is at least partially responsible for the dismal material inequalities which exist among present-day nation states.<span style="">  </span>To make matters worse, she contends that it is ultimately untenable, and she devotes the bulk of her article to uncovering the problems.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The final chapter, "Stoic emotion" by Lawrence Becker, is more positive.<span style="">  </span>Continuing the attempt to rehabilitate Stoic ethics that he began in his 1998 <i>A New Stoicism</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, Becker here attempts to clear a main hurdle facing that project: <span style=""> </span>namely, "the idea that there is something deeply wrong, and perhaps even psychologically impossible, about the kind of emotional life that Stoics recommend" (250).<span style="">  </span>As he did in his book, Becker distinguishes between what Stoics have actually said about the issue versus what they ought to say.<span style="">  </span>While it is true that "some ancient Stoics (notably Chrysippus) underestimated the extent to which emotion was a necessary component of psychological health and thus of virtue" (251), Becker sees no reason why contemporary Stoics such as himself cannot concede the mistake without damage to underlying normative principles.<span style="">  </span>Stoic ethical theory requires that we make our emotions appropriate.<span style="">  </span>Those </span><i>in extremis</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> may need to heed Chrysippus' call for the extirpation of their emotions; the rest of us won't.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">As the foregoing suggests, the papers collected in <i>Stoicism:<span style="">  </span>Traditions and Transformations</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> are rich and varied.<span style="">  </span>This reviewer would take issue with many of the claims but since the (alleged) problems don't diminish the basic originality and importance of the volume, they will be bypassed in favor of one global criticism.<span style="">  </span>It concerns the objectives of the volume.<span style="">  </span>In their generally helpful introduction, the editors say that "[t]he essays in this volume are intended to . . .<span style="">  </span>[explore] how Stoicism actually influenced philosophers from antiquity through the modern period in fields ranging from logic and ethics to politics and theology" (1).<span style="">  </span>In keeping with this mandate, many of the individual authors -- Engberg-Pedersen, Normore, Lagrée, Rutherford, Nussbaum -- do speak of instances of "actual influence" by Stoicism on this person or that concept.<span style="">  </span>It would be absurd to deny that Stoicism was influential; yet, it is another thing entirely to </span><i>prove</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> specific cases of influence.<span style="">  </span>And it is unclear why philosophers should care all that much:<span style="">  </span>what we're more interested in is how the ideas and arguments compare, not where they came from.<span style="">  </span>The task of determining influence is distinct, both conceptually and scholarly, from that of determining philosophical kinship.<span style="">  </span>The former involves studies of the transmission and reception of texts; the latter, the analysis of the proximity of arguments.<span style="">  </span>Whether they think so or not, almost all the papers in the volume engaged in the latter; many of the most important errors would have been avoided if they had recognized as much.</span></p>
