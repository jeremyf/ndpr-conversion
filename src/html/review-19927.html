	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The  issues surrounding epistemic value have, until recently, been mostly neglected by epistemologists. Today, epistemic value is in vogue. This is largely due to virtue  epistemologists' who argue that non-virtue analyses of knowledge can't adequately explain why knowledge is more valuable than a true belief falling short of  knowledge. However, there are many other value-laden questions. For example: "If knowledge has a special sort of value, what sort of value is it?<span class="GramE">";</span> "Should the value of knowledge be grounded in truth?"; "Is truth the fundamental epistemic value?"; "Are all true beliefs equally valuable?". Despite the recent attention, a sustained discussion surrounding questions of epistemic value has  generally been lacking. Consequently, Haddock, Millar and Prichard's <i style="">Epistemic  Value </i>provides a needed, and highly recommended, collection of essays. The book is composed of thirteen articles divided  into two main sections, along with an appendix containing a book review of  Jonathan <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig's</span> <i style="">The Value of Knowledge and the Nature of Understanding</i>. I will address each  section, along with the articles found within.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-AU">Part 1: The Value of Knowledge</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The first nine articles  discuss the value of knowledge, and generally center around what is known as the  Value Problem. The problem is generated by an intuition that knowledge has  more epistemic value than mere true belief. Indeed, it seems that knowledge  is more valuable than any proper subset of its constituents. However, explaining  <i style="">why</i> knowledge is more valuable than an unknown true belief has proven extremely difficult. For example, many epistemologists view truth as the fundamental epistemic value and claim  that other epistemic evaluations -- particularly, epistemic justification<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> -- derive their value from their instrumental connection to truth.  However, if justification only has instrumental value for getting at the truth, then it's  difficult to see why a justified true belief is more valuable than an unjustified  true belief, since in both cases the goal of truth is achieved. Given that justification is valuable and that a justified belief <i style="">is</i>  better than an unjustified belief, the lesson is that finding another valuable property of knowledge beyond truth is not sufficient to explain its value. The other value cannot be merely instrumentally  connected to the value of truth, otherwise it will be 'swamped' by truth's presence.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In "<span class="SpellE">Reliabilism</span> and the Value of Knowledge," Alvin Goldman and Erik Olson argue for two solutions to the Value Problem within a <span class="SpellE">reliabilist</span> framework. First, they argue that knowledge is more valuable than mere  true belief in that the probability of having more true beliefs of a similar  kind is greater conditional on S's knowing that p than conditional on S's merely  truly believing that p. Second, they argue that sometimes reliable processes  attain independent or autonomous value despite initially only having  instrumental value. They draw an analogy with moral evaluations and claim that good  motives are valuable because they bring about intrinsically valuable actions but  are also thought to be goods in themselves.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Jason Baer, in "Is There a  Value Problem<span class="GramE">?,</span>" argues that the Value Problem is  not well motivated. Intuitions constrain analyses only if, first, they are  formal by not providing "any indication of why or that in virtue of which  knowledge is more valuable than a true belief." Second, an analysis must be  general "in the sense that it must cover or be applicable to all instances of  knowledge". Baer argues that the guiding intuition for the Value Problem is neither  formal nor general, and therefore fails as a constraint on one's analysis of knowledge.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Martin Kusch, in "Testimony  and the Value of Knowing," approaches the Value Problem from a "communitarian" perspective and claims that we should understand knowledge via the historical process through which the concept was  formed. Kusch argues that the ancestral concept, <span class="SpellE"><i style="">protoknowledge</i></span>, was valuable in being intimately tied to the institution of testimony and helping the  community identify who is a reliable source of information. Since testimony is an intrinsically valuable institution and central to our existence as  information sharing creatures, <span class="SpellE"><i style="">protoknowledge</i></span> is valuable not only in being true but also by helping to sustain this indispensably valuable institution.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In "The Value of  Understanding," Jonathan <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig</span> argues that, unlike  knowledge, <span class="SpellE">objectual</span> understanding --  understanding some object or subject -- has a special kind of value exceeding that of true belief.  Since understanding -- which requires "seeing explanatory connections, being  aware of the probabilistic interrelationships, and apprehending the logical implications of the information in question" -- can be luckily acquired  it does not need to respond to the <span class="SpellE">Gettier</span>  Problem, which <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig</span> argues makes the value problem  for knowledge <span class="SpellE">intractable</span>. <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig</span> admits that there are some forms of understanding -- perhaps some form  of 'explanatory understanding' like 'understanding why' -- that require the presence of knowledge; however, <span class="SpellE">objectual</span> understanding  does not.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Michael DePaul challenges <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig's</span> claim that <i style="">ad hoc</i> and gerrymandered analyses of knowledge cannot explain why  knowledge is distinctively valuable. This claim seems to assume that those reflecting  on an adequate analysis of some concept should recognize whether or not  something that satisfies the analysis is valuable. DePaul rejects this assumption  since value judgments typically arise from our "ordinary thinking" of the thing in question, whereas our analyses often "employ concepts that are foreign to the ordinary modes of thought within which evaluations find  their home."</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In "The Goods and the  Motivation of Believing," Ward Jones examines the role of <span class="SpellE">doxastic</span> goods in motivating beliefs. Adopting the view that that reasons are necessarily potential motivators for beliefs, Jones argues that many <span class="SpellE">doxastic</span> goods fail as motivators and are merely  beneficial -- or 'surreptitious' -- side effects of believing. He concludes that if  the value of knowledge is accounted for in terms of credit, as many virtue-theoretic accounts suggest, then knowledge is only a  surreptitious good and not a motivator for belief.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In "Practical Reasoning and  the Concept of Knowledge," Matthew Weiner argues that although pragmatic  encroachment accounts of knowledge -- specifically the thesis: it is unacceptable to  use p as a premise in your practical reasoning if and only if you do not know  that p -- can explain why knowledge is distinctively valuable, they are plagued  with problems. He argues that properties of beliefs other than justification  or truth may be most important for practical deliberation. Consequently,  knowledge is valuable not because of its value in practical deliberation, but  because it provides many different features of belief that are individually  intrinsically valuable.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Pascal Engel, in "Pragmatic Encroachment and Epistemic Value," not only challenges pragmatic encroachment on epistemic notions, but also its relevance<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b>to the value of knowledge. Engel acknowledges the <i style="">relevance</i> of practical interests to whether or not we form our beliefs. Although pragmatic considerations often have a significant effect on the extent  of our intellectual inquiry, they don't determine whether we <i style="">ought </i>to  form the beliefs we do.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Wayne Riggs, in "Luck,  Knowledge, and Control," closes the first section of the book by examining the connection between luck and knowledge. Riggs accepts that some kind of  luck is incompatible with knowledge, but argues that luck understood in terms of  a safety condition -- a la Prichard (2005)<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup> -- is incapable of adequately explaining this connection. Rather, Riggs develops a notion of luck that involves agential control and argues that  it is better suited to explain the adage that knowledge and luck are  incompatible.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-AU">Part II: Truth and Epistemic Appraisal</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The next four entries in the  book focus on the value of truth and its connection to other epistemic evaluations.
</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Michael Lynch, in "The Values  of Truth and the Truth of Values," examines two meta-normative positions regarding the value of truth. Many claim that "it is prima facie good  that, relative to the propositions one might consider, one believe all and  only those that are true" or that "it is correct to believe </span>&lt;p&gt; if and only if &lt;p&gt; is true". Lynch argues that unlike in meta-ethics  where <span class="SpellE">skepticism</span> about moral value -- as  articulated in <span class="SpellE">expressivist</span> theories -- may  be plausible, <span class="SpellE">skepticism</span> about the epistemic  value is untenable and self-undermining.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In "Epistemic <span class="SpellE">Normativity</span>," Stephen Grimm argues that teleological accounts that claim that beliefs  inherit positive value insofar as they promote or achieve truth -- which is intrinsically valuable -- face a dilemma. An unrestricted approach that  claims all truths are intrinsically valuable clashes with intuitions that there  are trivial truths with seemingly no intrinsic epistemic value. However, a  more restricted approach claiming that truth is valuable insofar as it  addresses subjects that are of interest or importance to us fails to account for  the appropriateness of epistemic appraisal for beliefs of subjects that seem uninteresting or unimportant.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Michael Brady, in "Curiosity  and the Value of Truth," challenges the claim that truth's intrinsic value  is conditional on it satisfying our inquiries and curiosities. First, it  seems possible that our inquiries and curiosities are aimed at things that are  of little value. Second, it is unlikely that we have a general, open-ended interest in truth. Brady argues that curiosity is an emotion involving selective attention and functions to alert us to things that are  interesting and valuable. However, this does not imply that true beliefs have value  if and only if they are answers to intrinsically valuable questions, but rather  that the aim on inquiry is intrinsically interesting truth -- rather than  truth <span class="SpellE"><i style="">simpliciter</i></span>.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Finally, in "The Trivial  Argument for Epistemic Value Pluralism," <span class="SpellE">Berit</span> <span class="SpellE">Brogaard</span> argues that epistemic monism -- the view  that truth is the fundamental epistemic goal -- entails the thesis -- (FT) --  that the truth value of any proposition is relative to the world of  evaluation. Unfortunately, (FT) fails adequately to accommodate the linguistic data. This failure  brings epistemic monism into question and motivates epistemic value pluralism,  the view that truth is only one of many epistemic goals whose supremacy can  be overridden.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The book also contains an  appendix consisting of a symposium on Jonathan <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig's</span>  <i style="">The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding</i>. <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig</span> first provides a  brief summary of his main thesis: that although knowledge does not posses any  special value exceeding the value of its subparts, understanding does. John  Greco, Catherine Elgin and Wayne Riggs provide responses to <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig</span>, who then provides replies to the respondents in turn.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Greco provides a few  criticisms of <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig's</span> <span class="SpellE">defense</span>  of his main thesis. First, he accuses <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig</span> of  vacillating between different criteria for what qualifies as a successful answer to  the value problem. Second, he challenges the claim that we have a  pre-theoretic intuition that knowledge is more valuable than any of its proper parts.  Third, he claims that <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig's</span> diagnosis fails  since virtue theoretic accounts of knowledge can provide an adequate explanation for  the value of knowledge even given his overly demanding requirements.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Elgin addresses <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig's</span> contention that understanding is <span class="SpellE">factive</span>.  She claims that scientific progress constitutes increased understanding. However,  since scientific theorizing <span class="SpellE">ineliminably</span> involves idealizations, scientific understanding does not entail truth, but  rather provides "epistemic access to matters of fact."</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Riggs attempts to clarify the  nature of the intuition motivating the value problem and argues that we should not  expect that knowledge is more valuable than any of its proper parts but rather  that knowledge possesses a kind of value that is not present in any  non-knowing state.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-AU">Comments</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">I do not have the space to  discuss all (or most) of the articles in this book, and so will focus my comments on  what I take as a promising approach to the value problem, and then make some  related points about the value of truth.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Unlike John Greco, I concede  the intuition that knowledge is more valuable than any proper subset of its constituents. But like Greco, and unlike Jonathan <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig</span>, I am optimistic that a virtue theoretic account <i style="">can</i>  provide an adequate explanation of the value of knowledge. On such accounts, knowledge is a true belief <i style="">manifesting</i> an intellectually virtuous performance. In other words, knowledge is had  when an individual is creditable for reaching the truth <i style="">because</i>  <i style="">of</i> her intellectually virtuous performance. This property of being creditable is supposed to  have intrinsic and distinctive epistemic value. Since one can be successful  without performing virtuously and since one can perform virtuously without being successful, being creditable carries epistemic value distinct from the  value of the success and from the value of the virtuous performance. Moreover,  virtue theorists claim that being creditable for a success can have value  exceeding the value of a successful virtuous performance because one's performance  can be virtuous and successful without being successful <i style="">because</i>  virtuous. <span class="SpellE">Gettier</span> cases are examples where one's performance is virtuous and successful but not  creditable.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">One challenge for virtue  accounts is explaining when a person deserves credit, since performing successfully  and virtuously is insufficient. Greco has <span class="SpellE">analyzed</span>  credit in terms of "the content and pragmatics of causal explanations,"<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup> in which credit is -- in part -- dependent on our interests and  purposes. In his reply to Greco, <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig</span> criticizes this  approach, and I think rightly so. However one need not adopt Greco's pragmatic  approach. Ernest Sosa does not <span class="SpellE">analyze</span> intellectual  credit in terms of the pragmatics of causal explanations. In fact, Sosa does not  provide a detailed analysis of what intellectual credit requires, but rather  gives an intuitive picture of what credit amounts to in performances generally.  For example, suppose that a skilled archer's shot is diverted from the  bull's eye by a gust of wind and then suddenly reoriented back to the bull's eye by  a second gust. It seems that the success of the shot was not because of  the <span class="SpellE">skillful</span> performance, but merely  fortuitously successful so that the archer is not credited for the success. Admittedly, it may be  vague whether an individual is creditable for some successful performances.  There seems to be no clear line to draw regarding how much luck precludes  credit. However, as <span class="SpellE">Kvanvig</span>, following Aristotle,  states in his discussion of understanding, "we should not look for more precision than the subject matter allows" (341). Furthermore, this is consistent with how we make moral evaluations. Despite recent work in moral  psychology showing that we are strongly influenced by our surroundings and  situations, we take ownership for many moral <span class="SpellE">behaviors</span>. We  offer praise and blame, credit people for performing rightly and assign  discredit when they perform wrongly, even while recognizing that there were other causally relevant factors in the <span class="SpellE">behaviors</span>.  But while a certain amount of luck is consistent with credit, sometimes the  external world is too involved so that our <span class="SpellE">behaviors</span>,  though appropriate, do not sufficiently explain the consequences.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Still, in order for one's  performance to be creditable it must be virtuous. So what is entailed<b style=""> </b>in  a virtuous performance? Some -- like Greco and Sosa -- argue that a virtuous performance requires the possession of an intellectual  virtue, which is understood as a stable disposition to reach the truth. However, one  problem with this approach is that even if being successful because of one's  reliable character is sufficient for a kind of <span class="GramE">credit,</span>  there is reason to doubt that this sort of credit entails distinctive intrinsic  value. Suppose that two identical twins received extensive physical  examinations immediately after birth. James is perfectly healthy. John, however, has  an undersized heart, which would normally result in health complications.  However, through a stroke of good luck John is blessed with a guardian angel <span class="GramE">who</span> prevents any heart complications from arising.  Although his heart is unreliable in sustaining healthy individuals, John's health  is identical to James's. According to the <span class="SpellE">reliabilist</span> view for credit, only James is creditable for his good health and  therefore his health should be more valuable than John's health despite being  qualitatively identical. However, this seems to the wrong conclusion. What we value is whether or not John's health is inferior to James's. If we were given  the choice between John's and James's physical makeup, knowing they would  result in qualitatively identical health, it seems to me that we would -- and  should -- be indifferent to which physiology we ended up with.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Another way of conceiving a  virtuous performance focuses not on having a virtuous -- i.e., reliable --  character but on <i style="">acting virtuously</i>. This approach allows for the possibility of acting virtuously in a way that is out of character. And one natural way to understand acting virtuously is by  appealing to responsible performances. For example, with regard to our  intellectual performances specifically, given that the aim of intellectual inquiry is  to acquire true beliefs and avoid false beliefs, one might claim that in  order to receive credit for reaching the truth one must be intellectually  responsible; that is, one must engage in the intellectual practices and employ those cognitive faculties that one has good reason to believe will reliably  yield true beliefs. Of course, in order to receive credit one's intellectual practices must in fact be reliable. Only those who responsibly engage in reliable intellectual practices are potential <span class="SpellE">knowers</span>. But by focusing on responsible -- in addition to reliable --  performances one now has the resources for solving the value problem. In order for  additional value to accrue to one's performance, one's aim must be achieved through responsible and reliable <span class="SpellE">behavior</span>, and we do  assign distinctive value to responsible performances. If given the choice to be  either fortuitously given a reliable physiology or to acquire one as a result  of one's responsible <span class="SpellE">behavior</span> we should prefer the  latter.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Issues of <span class="SpellE">doxastic</span> control immediately arise. Many argue that in order to be responsible  for our beliefs we have to have some sort of control over them. It also seems,  however, that we do not have direct control over what we believe. Perhaps a sort  of indirect control is all that's needed to be responsible for our beliefs.  This connects closely with Riggs's argument that epistemic luck understood in  terms of agential control best preserves the widespread judgment that luck  undermines knowledge. I have argued that in order adequately to answer the value  problem by appealing to credit, a virtuous performance necessitates a  responsible and reliable performance. If responsibility entails control then the above  argument can be seen as supplemental to Riggs's discussion. However, it is worth  noting that some have made strong arguments that responsibility for our beliefs  does not require the sort of control exhibited over our actions.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Lastly I want to make some  brief comments about the value of truth. By accounting for the value of  knowledge in terms of being credited for a true belief via responsible and reliable performance, I have assumed that truth has intrinsic epistemic value.  Grimm, however, challenges this assumption in his contribution by appealing to  the existence of trivial truths, i.e., truths that seem to have no epistemic  value. For example, believing truly that there are 959 motes of dust on my desk  seems devoid of all value.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Grimm rightly notes that  Ernest Sosa offers a solution to the trivial truths objection by restricting our  evaluative judgments to domains. Once so restricted, we can then appropriately  identify fundamental and derivative values within a given domain while  acknowledging that such values may lack overall value or value outside that domain.  For example one can acknowledge that scoring runs is a fundamental value  within the domain of baseball without making any commitments about the overall  value of scoring runs. Similarly, in the epistemic domain truth is a fundamental  value, although some truths may lack value outside of that domain.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Grimm objects, however, that  by indexing the value of truth to the epistemic domain one fails to account for the  binding nature of our epistemic obligations. He <span class="GramE">claims that</span>  "to judge a belief to be justified is not simply to judge that it is <span class="SpellE">skillfully</span> oriented to the truth but rather that  it should be so oriented, in some binding sense of 'should'" (257). However, it is not clear what sense of 'binding' Grimm is referring to. We are often  presented with cases of conflicting value -- for example, between the practical  and the epistemic, or between the moral and the practical -- and it seems a  mistake to think that the epistemic will always trump other considerations. A  mother who has overwhelming evidence that her son will die of cancer may be  all-things-considered permitted -- and perhaps obligated -- to believe that he will survive if  that belief will bring her and her son hope and strength. Now, there is a  sense in which the mother still ought not to believe that her son will survive.  But this is the more circumscribed, domain-specific notion that Sosa is  endorsing. Consider one last example. There are probably many baseball players who  shouldn't be -- all things considered -- swinging at the pitches they swing at.  Rather they should be at home spending more time with their families. However,  this fact doesn't invalidate the way that their performances can still be  evaluated from within the domain of good baseball playing. In this more narrow  sense they should be swinging at the pitches they swing at. After all they are  right down the middle of the plate. Epistemic norms are always binding within the intellectual domain just as hitting norms are always binding within the baseball domain. However, once we stop outside the respective domains  all bets are off.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">I'll close by reiterating  that discussions surrounding epistemic value are in their infancy, and <i style="">Epistemic Value </i>provides a needed resource in what is sure to be a burgeoning area of inquiry.</span></p>    <div style="">
