	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Cambridge Introductions to Key Philosophical Texts offer 'introductory textbooks on what are  considered to be the most important texts of Western Philosophy'. This one introduces a  book that has undoubtedly been extremely important over the last forty years:  John Rawls' <i style="">A Theory of Justice</i> (henceforth TJ). As one of Rawls' critics, Robert <span class="SpellE">Nozick</span>,  wrote in 1974: 'Political philosophers now must either work within Rawls'  theory or explain why not'.</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""> Jon <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> is surely right that this remains as  true now as it was in 1974.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">In accordance with the aim of the series, the basic tone of the book is expository. Often, however,  the exposition is broken off to sketch briefly and then reject  interpretations of Rawls' position that <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> finds  exegetically and otherwise unsatisfactory. <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> pays  particular attention to showing why TJ should not be read as an early  luck-egalitarian work and why it is not a defense of welfare-state capitalism. He is  basically sympathetic to the project in TJ and sees his task as one of rescuing  'its core from misinterpretation and misguided criticisms' (p. 34).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mandle's</span></span><span style=""> book is divided into four main parts. The first part offers a brief  sketch of Rawls' life and truly remarkable personality, his pre-TJ work, an  overview of the main arguments and principles of TJ, and a critical review of two influential, but according to <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span>,  misguided interpretations of TJ: first, that Rawls rejects the notion of desert altogether and, second, that Rawls holds the luck-egalitarian belief  that 'all inequalities that are arbitrary -- those who are nobody's fault -- are presumptively unjust' (p. 24). <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> does a  good job showing why crucial elements in Rawls' position are incompatible with luck-egalitarianism -- e.g., the difference principle appears to permit inequalities that reflect arbitrary differences in people's talents --  and why some passages normally offered in support of a luck-egalitarian  interpretation of Rawls should be read differently. However, a suspicion lingers on. Luck-egalitarianism was clearly articulated as a position only after TJ  was published and, accordingly, one might presume that <span class="SpellE">TJ's</span> relation to luck-egalitarianism may not be as clear-cut as one would  have liked it to be forty years later. Some passages in TJ seem quite open to a luck-egalitarian interpretation and some do not, and, accordingly, any  attempt to impose a uniform interpretation on TJ will clash with some passages  in TJ or with what these passages commit Rawls to. For instance, it seems that  the part of the intuitive argument for the difference principle that invokes considerations about moral arbitrariness fits quite well within a luck-egalitarian framework. <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> seems to  recognize this much when he feels the need to write that this argument is 'not  found in [Rawls'] published lectures on justice as fairness' (p. 27) and is not  Rawls' 'official' argument for the difference principle (whatever 'official'  means here -- offhand, it would seem that if one provides an unofficial  argument for something, it does not mean that one does not in fact endorse the  argument).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">The second part consists of three chapters, each of which corresponds to a part of TJ and comes in  the same chronological order as the corresponding parts in TJ. Chapter 2  introduces the main and most well-known components of Rawls' theory of justice as  fairness: the two principles of justice, the way in which justice as fairness  differs from intuitionism as well as utilitarianism, reflective equilibrium,  primary goods, the veil of ignorance, and the original position. One noticeable  interpretative claim is that Rawls' argument for the difference principle makes no  appeal to the <span class="SpellE">maximin</span> principle for choice under  uncertainty (p. 65).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Chapter 3 expounds Rawls' discussion of which institutions may satisfy his two principles of  justice. Part of the motivation for this discussion is that we cannot be  justified in accepting Rawls' two principles of justice unless we can see how these  can be realized through an attractive institutional scheme (p. 75). According  to <span class="SpellE">Mandle's</span> Rawls, several sets of  institutions may do so. However, some institutions do it better than others and, unlike the  dominant view, Rawls thinks that a property-owning democracy can be expected to  do so better than traditional welfare-state models of capitalism because the  former better secures 'the fair value of political liberties and fair equality  of opportunity' (p. 89).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Chapter 4 explains Rawls' account of why a society that satisfies his principles of justice may be  stable for the right reasons. Essential here is that citizens' sense of justice  can be congruent with <span class="GramE">their</span> 'other values and goals'  (p. 109); crucial to ensuring this is Rawls' claim that 'the collective  activity of justice is the preeminent form of human flourishing' (p. 130).</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[2]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""> This part of Rawls' theory of justice, like the ground covered in  Chapter 3, normally receives less attention in standard commentaries than it does  in <span class="SpellE">Mandle's</span> book, and this neglect might not  have been justified on Rawls' understanding of the significance of his own work. <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> quotes Freeman as reporting that Rawls  himself thought his argument for congruence was his most original contribution  in TJ and was puzzled that it did not attract more attention (p. 142). Since,  as <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> stresses, the difference principle  is only one component in Rawls' full theory of justice, and even one that is  lexically subordinated to the other components, this more proportionate (page-number-wise) attention to different parts of TJ is a welcome  distinctive feature of the book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">The third part of <span class="SpellE">Mandle's</span>  book relates TJ to some of Rawls' later works, notably <i style="">Political Liberalism</i>, and his idea about a reasonable consensus between overlapping views and the  political conception of a moral person. Basically, <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> thinks that the distance between TJ and Rawls' later works is smaller  than it is normally assumed to be and that any identifiable differences are due, mostly, to Rawls' 'ultimate dissatisfaction' (p. 142) with his  congruence argument (apparently in slight tension with his abovementioned reported  puzzlement over readers' focus).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">In the last chapter, <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span>  addresses a handful of criticisms of Rawls: various criticisms of Rawls' methodology, including Hare's remarkable charge  that Rawls proposes a form of subjectivism according to which 'thinking something  can make it so' (p. 174);</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[3]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Sandel's</span> and <span class="SpellE">Walzer's</span> communitarian critiques; <span class="SpellE">Nozick's</span>  libertarian rejection of patterned or end-state principles of distributive justice;  and, finally, G. A. Cohen's luck-egalitarian criticism of Rawls' acceptance  of incentives-induced inequalities. Generally speaking, the selection of criticisms addressed is representative of the critical literature on  Rawls, and the pro-et-contra arguments are well presented. However, as one who  finds Cohen's criticism of incentives-based inequalities very forceful, I was  not convinced by <span class="SpellE">Mandle's</span> dismissal of  luck-egalitarian criticisms of Rawls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Rawls' difference principle is probably the part of his theory of justice that has attracted most attention. On one of the several non-overlapping formulations it  receives in TJ it says that inequalities are just only if the worst off are as well off  as possible. Most have understood this to mean that Rawls allows for just inequalities, namely, so-called incentives-induced inequalities. The  idea is that talented people will not be motivated to make an extra effort if  they must share whatever extra output they produce with all others, thereby  imposing a strict equality regime. However, if one allows talented people to keep a significant proportion of the extra product that would result if they  were to make an extra effort, taxing away the rest to benefit the worst off,  they would be motivated to make this extra effort, and, accordingly, everyone would  be better off than under an equal distribution. Thus, the difference  principle would seem to allow this inequality and, setting aside his principle of  fair equality of opportunity, it follows that Rawls is not an egalitarian in a strict sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Cohen rejects this view. He asks us to consider what makes incentives necessary for making the worst  off as well off as possible. Aside from some cases that he finds marginal  (cases in which talented people are psychologically unable to make an extra effort  in the absence of incentives) or at any rate non-damaging to egalitarianism  (cases in which extra rewards are necessary to compensate talented people for  stressful jobs), Cohen contends that incentives are necessary to improve the  situation of the worst off only because the talented people <i style="">freely choose</i>  not to make an extra effort in the absence of incentives. But, Cohen argues, this refusal is incompatible with the  difference principle -- the worst off are worse off under incentives-induced  inequalities than they would be if the talented decided to make an extra effort in  the absence of incentives -- and, accordingly, in a well-ordered society in  which people act in their daily lives from <span class="SpellE">Rawlsian</span> principles of justice, talented people would not insist on incentives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mandle</span></span><span style=""> is not persuaded by this criticism. Unlike some philosophers who have  rejected Cohen's criticism, he does not dismiss it simply on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Rawlsian</span> principles of justice apply only to the  basic structure of society and not to what we do in our daily lives. Rather,  he quotes Rawls statement that 'a complete theory of right includes  principles for individuals as well' (p. 195).</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[4]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""> However, the 'question is whether the same principles that apply to the  basic structure [i.e., the difference principle] must also apply to individual conduct' (p. 195). <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> is surely right  that there is a question here, and Cohen offers some reasons for thinking that  Rawls is committed to thinking that the difference principle applies to  individual conduct as well.</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[5]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""> I am less sure what reasons <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> offers in  favor of the view that the former set of principles include the difference  principle whereas the latter do not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Another reply <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span>  offers on Rawls' behalf says that a just basic structure 'is likely to have a significant effect on the ethos that  guides individual conduct in the society' (p. 195) so that talented people will not be  inclined to insist on 'extortion-like' demands for incentives. However, <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> concedes that this reply 'does not refute  [Cohen's] critique', although 'it does somewhat blunt its force' (p. 196). It does  not refute this criticism because it does not show that it is impossible for  there to be an incentives-induced inequality in a society satisfying <span class="SpellE">Rawlsian</span> requirements (as <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> understands them) reflecting talented people's choice not to produce as  much as they could for the benefit of the worst-off in the absence of incentives  (while still being no worse off than untalented people). The reason that it  blunts its force is, I take it, that if a just <span class="SpellE">Rawlsian</span>  basic structure results in an incentives-unfriendly ethos, as a matter of fact  the amount of incentives needed to make the worst off as well off as  possible is not so much greater than in a just <span class="SpellE">Rawlsian-Cohenian</span> society, where no or only very few incentives are necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">But I do not think Cohen would concede the latter point. After all, his criticism is put forward  as a criticism of the incentives-friendly reading of the difference principle understood as a fundamental principle of justice and not as a principle  of regulation, as it were. To refute the former sort of principle, you only  need to show that it has a false implication in one case. Fundamental  principles are either true or false. However, principles of regulation can lead to  results that are more or less close to the target that we aim at through  applying certain principles of regulation. Here there is a difference between a criticism saying that a principle of regulation is useless because using  it gets us nowhere near the target and saying that while it does not get us  to what we aim at, it gets us close enough. However, as I said, the point  here is that Cohen wants to criticize the difference principle as a fundamental principle of justice, not as a principle of regulation. Presumably many <span class="SpellE">Rawlsians</span> are similarly inclined when, for  instance, they do not say that the force of the <span class="SpellE">Rawlsian</span>  critique of utilitarianism is somewhat blunted when it is shown that maximizing  utility is often achieved through a basic structure that is not too different from  one required to realize the difference principle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">All in all, <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span>  thinks the incentives debate shows something important about 'the fundamental contrast between Rawls and Cohen' when  it comes to their views on justice:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: normal;"><span style="">For Rawls, although the principles of justice are regulative, they are not "all controlling." . . . For Cohen, in contrast, justice will give individuals no discretion concerning any action that affects the  distribution of goods in society (p. 197).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">I agree with <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span>  that Rawls and Cohen might well have very different views of justice, but I wonder if this particular contrast captures well  what this difference consists in. Note that Cohen is a luck-egalitarian, and  if, as <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> writes, this view implies that  justice 'requires an equal distribution of goods, except where an individual's greater or  lesser share can be traced to choices for which that individual is responsible'  (p. 198), it would seem to follow that, on Cohen's view, justice gives one discretion to make any genuinely free choice that will lead to one's  having a greater or lesser share than others. True, if you have greater talents  than me and we make the same choices, luck-egalitarian justice does not give you discretion to keep all of your greater rewards, but that is precisely  because these greater rewards are not all traceable to your choices, as opposed  to your greater talents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">By way of further characterization of the divide between <span class="SpellE">Rawlsian</span>  and <span class="SpellE">Cohenian</span> views on justice, <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> quotes <span class="SpellE">Korsgaard</span> as saying that the 'subject  matter of morality is not what we should bring about, but how we should relate  to one another' (p. 199), apparently suggesting that Rawls is concerned with  the latter and that Cohen is exclusively concerned with the former.</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[6]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""> Again, this strikes me as a serious mischaracterization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">One theoretical item that plays an important role in Cohen's critique of Rawls is the so-called 'interpersonal test', which<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: normal;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">tests</span></span><span style=""> how robust a policy argument is by subjecting it to variation with respect to who is speaking and/or who is listening  when the argument is presented. The test asks whether the argument could  serve as a justification of a mooted policy when uttered by any member of society  to any other member.</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[7]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">If an argument fails the interpersonal test this implies that the sender and addressee of the  argument fail to form what Cohen calls a 'justificatory community' -- 'a set of  people among whom there prevails a norm' such that<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: normal;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">if</span></span><span style=""> what certain people are disposed to do when a  policy is in force is part of the justification of that policy, it is  considered appropriate to ask them to justify the relevant behavior, and it  detracts from justificatory community when they cannot do so.</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[8]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">The point of the interpersonal test and the concept of a justificatory community is, in  essence, to bring out an I-thou perspective that is very crucial to Cohen's way  of thinking about justice and which he thinks is often overlooked when justifications for policies involving the conduct of individuals are  stated from a third-person perspective. Whatever the difference between Rawls  and Cohen is, it is not that Cohen is not concerned about 'how we should  relate to one another'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Having paid significant attention to <span class="SpellE">Mandle's</span> treatment of the  relation between Rawls, luck-egalitarianism, and Cohen's critique of incentives, I hasten to say this is only a small part of his book. While I have some  serious reservations about this part, I still think it works reasonably well as  part of a helpful introductory overview of the main responses to TJ, albeit one  that is not entirely correct for the reasons indicated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Writing a book of the sort <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span>  has written here is not easy. TJ is a very complex work that covers a vast terrain in political philosophy and beyond, and while  there are certainly important connections between the different parts of TJ,  they are not always set out with great clarity. Going over most of the topics  covered by TJ in about one-fifth of the number of pages of TJ does not result in an  easily read book that forcefully brings out a handful of core ideas and  arguments. Hence, as a plain introductory text to students who want to get the  first grasp of the main ideas of Rawls and not much beyond that, <span class="SpellE">Mandle's</span> book has less to offer than some of the other introductory works on the  market. However, as an introductory text that students use as a supplement to a  careful reading of TJ itself, it is an excellent book. For Rawls scholars, the  book is interesting because of the way in which it critically comments on  various received interpretations of TJ. It does justice to the two latter parts  of TJ in a way that few other introductory texts do and is quite helpful in  explaining the structure of these less well-read last 400 pages of TJ. Last, but  not least, <span class="SpellE">Mandle's</span> book is interesting because  he couples his anti-luck egalitarian reading of Rawls with his view that  Rawls favors property-owning democracy over welfare-state capitalism --  because of how the former better than the latter ensures that citizens can relate  to one another as equals. In making this connection, <span class="SpellE">Mandle</span> strikes a chord that is intriguing and very up-to-date in the light of Elizabeth <span class="GramE">Anderson's</span> and Samuel <span class="SpellE">Scheffler's</span> recent critiques of luck-egalitarianism.</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[9]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
