	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Like many of the contemporary thinkers with whom  he engages, Max Statkiewicz diagnoses the impact of Platonism on  contemporary western thought as a function of a selective reading of Plato's critique  of poetry, one which overlooks the complexity of the dialogues' treatment  of representation. Thus, at its most general, his <i style="">Rhapsody of Philosophy: Dialogues with Plato in Contemporary Thought</i>  comprises a series of meditations upon Gilles Deleuze's oft-quoted claim that Plato  himself made the first step in overturning Platonism. More specifically, the  book has two trajectories: to illustrate an element of Platonic thought (its "rhapsodic" dimension) that has not been sufficiently attended to by what Statkiewicz identifies as the two main camps of Plato scholarship  (the traditional and the dramatic) and to draw out the connection between  this element and the work of a number of contemporary theorists, a connection  which should point the way toward a fuller dialogue between ancient and  contemporary thought. What Statkiewicz means by "rhapsodic" unfolds throughout the book, but is presented in the introduction as "the mode of thinking -- Plato's mode, replayed in the texts of Nietzsche, Heidegger, Jacques  Derrida, Luce Irigaray, Deleuze, Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe -- that  challenges the dominance of univocal interpretation, as well as the corresponding  treatise format, in the modern philosophical tradition" (4). </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">According to Statkiewicz, both the approach to  the dialogues that seeks rigorously maintained propositions and the approach  that emphasizes the dramatic and dialogic character of Plato's work share the assumption that an interpretation of the dialogues rises and falls with  one's capacity to uncover the intention of Plato the author. Because the  variety of voices and gestures that appear in the dialogues defy reduction to the  single voice of Plato, appeals to authorial intent overlook the radical  polysemia of the dialogues; that is, according to Statkiewicz, such appeals overlook  their rhapsodic character. What is gained, then, in attempting a rhapsodic  dialogue with Plato, is resistance to a trend that fails to do justice to the  dialogues themselves and that forecloses the possibility of "authentic dialogue" with Plato: "Only a genuinely rhapsodic reading will be able to respect the integrality of a dialogue and at the same time set into  play its mimetic character" (14).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Thus, to take up a metaphor Statkiewicz uses in  his introduction, this book fights a battle on many fronts. In between its "Polemic Introduction" and its "Rhapsodic Conclusion," its four chapters develop the book's main themes by presenting the  engagement of a variety of thinkers with passages from the <i style="">Republic,</i> the <i style="">Phaedrus</i>, the <i style="">Sophist</i> and the <i style="">Timaeus</i>.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In Chapter 1, "Platonic Theater: Rigor and Play  in the <i style="">Republic</i> (Genette and Lacoue-Labarthe)," Statkiewicz highlights the significance of "rigor" (<i style="">akribeia)</i> in the <i style="">Republic</i>,  arguing that <i style="">akribeia</i> acts as the impulse behind the allocation of types and social rules that figure so prominently in the foundation of the city and the presence of justice within it. At the  same time, Socrates' appeal to and employment of <i style="">akribeia</i> involves a playful and mimetic component that constantly unsettles and  disturbs the types and roles that Socrates establishes. This playful, rhapsodic dimension of the dialogue is missed by those thinkers, Heidegger and  Genette in particular, who focus on Book 10's conception of mimesis rather than  book 3's, that is to say, who view mimesis in the <i style="">Republic</i> through the lens of representation rather than performance.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In Chapter 2, "<i style="">Le Beau Jeu</i>: the play of Beauty and Truth in the <i style="">Phaedrus </i>(Nietzsche,  Heidegger, Derrida)," Statkiewicz turns to the infamous palinode of the <i style="">Phaedrus</i> in order to examine Heidegger and Derrida's engagement with Nietzsche's  attempt to overturn Platonism by means of their reformulation of the quarrel  between philosophy and poetry on the one hand and the discord between art and  truth on the other, both of which they see at work in this dialogue. Statkiewicz  argues that the unity of the <i style="">Phaedrus</i> consists in its replaying the opposition between philosophy and poetry,  i.e., in its rhapsodic dimension. While the chapter attempts to illustrate  this dimension of the palinode, much of the chapter is occupied with  defending the critique of Heidegger's treatment of the <i style="">Phaedrus</i> implicit in Derrida's own work on the dialogue. According to  Statkiewicz, Derrida's use of play, like Nietzsche's trope of "woman," opens up the poetic dimension of the palinode in a manner that Heidegger simply  failed to take into account, a failure that requires a reconsideration of  Heidegger's assessment of Nietzsche's attempt to overturn Platonism.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Chapter 3, "The Notion of (Re)Semblance in the <i style="">Sophist</i> (Deleuze, Foucault, Nancy)," presents its principal theorists as resisting the temptation to treat the ontological investigations and the dramatic setting of the  dialogue separately while also criticizing these thinkers for failing to note the relationship between what Statkiewicz views as the two features of the  dialogue that most complicate its dialectical divisions: the difference between  image and simulacrum and that between philosopher and sophist. Statkiewicz  locates Deleuze's illustration of Plato's own overturning of Platonism in  Deleuze's work on the challenge simulacra (non-resembling images) and repetition  pose to the structure of representation. Statkiewicz then draws out Foucault's  kinship with Deleuze, as evinced by Foucault's engagement with modern painting,  on the question of the distance between repetition and resemblance. Both  Foucault's analysis of Magritte and Deleuze's analysis of the work of Francis Bacon reveal, according to Statkiewicz, an irreducible representational  element at work in the play between image and simulacrum, a play that is well  captured by the work of mimesis in the <i style="">Sophist</i>. Finally, Statkiewicz turns to Nancy's work, arguing that it illuminates  the rhapsodic dimension of the dialogue and reveals the mimetic gesture that occupies the heart of philosophy in its very attempt, doomed to failure,  to distinguish itself from sophistry. Statkiewicz concludes this chapter by reflecting on Nancy's development of the iconic and rhapsodic aspects of mimesis at work in the <i style="">Sophist</i>, asserting that the play between these two is what grants to art and to  the Platonic dialogue itself the possibility of subverting as well as  enforcing a dominant ideological structure: </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Plato's text itself  weaves (or stitches -- <i style="">rhaptei</i>) together such apparently incompatible epistemological, aesthetic, and ontological  categories as myth and the method of division, mimesis and diegesis, being and  nonbeing, and image and simulacrum in the double, questioning movement of the  serious play of (re)semblance (131).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Chapter 4, "The Abyssal Ground of World and Discourse in the <i style="">Timaeus</i> (Kristeva, Irigaray, Butler, Derrida)," offers an account of the interrogations undertaken by these thinkers of the ontic and political significance of  the Timaean chora. According to Statkiewicz, all of these theorists see a connection between chora and mimesis as both destabilizing and  threatening the hierarchies and conceptual apparatus of Platonism from within the  Platonic dialogues themselves. What sets these thinkers apart from more  traditional interpretations of the dialogue, and sets Derrida apart in an exemplary  way, is what renders them rhapsodic according to Statkiewicz: their various  efforts to stitch together "the scientific, cosmological content of the dialogue  and its dramatic and political frame" (135). Statkiewicz himself will insist  upon the need to read the controversial sense of chora in the <i style="">Timaeus</i>  as the "receptacle" of being with the more pedestrian sense of the word as "place" or "region." This chapter begins by identifying the role of mimesis in the <i style="">Timaeus</i>,  with appeal to both the <i style="">Republic</i> and the <i style="">Critias</i>, as bound up with the dialogue's reflection on becoming, and as connected  to chora (understood in its relation to the social and political field of established social roles and political identities) by means of their  shared destabilization of roles and identities: "The chora opens up a 'leeway,' a <i style="">Spielraum</i>,  a space of play with the il-lusions of mimesis." (144). Thus, chora, like mimesis, presents the possibility of a resistance to the rigorous attribution of roles and  status; it is this capacity for resistance that draws the attention of the various theorists Statkiewicz surveys in the rest of the chapter.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Statkiewicz concludes by critiquing Gadamer's  hermeneutic approach to the Platonic dialogues on the grounds that its privileging  of the attainment of univocal meaning neutralizes the gesture toward plurality  and difference that it makes on the way to such a meaning. He then turns to  offer an extended reading of the <i style="">Ion</i> designed to bring together the preceding discussion of contemporary  engagements with Plato and to trace out a dialogue between poetry and thought.  Statkiewicz then ends by developing his notion of dialogue, with help from Heidegger  and Nancy, as a rhapsodic community of readers (189) in which all roles and  voices are open to all participants.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">As Statkiewicz makes clear in the introduction,  the book's aim is less to offer an interpretation of Plato's dialogues than  to observe the "rhapsodic confrontation with Platonism" in the work of a number of contemporary theorists (27). He does make claims about the significance and meaning of particular passages in the dialogues;  however, a few of these claims are controversial. For instance, the  characterization of Thrasymachus as the actor/sophist whose rhapsodic intrusion provides a  foil to Socrates' supposed valorization of <i style="">akribeia</i> leaves much to be desired. After all, as Statkiewicz himself  acknowledges, it is Thrasymachus who introduces the standard of precision and  Statkiewicz's main argument for why we should really attribute it to Socrates in the <i style="">Republic </i>(that Plato's audience would have associated <i style="">akribeia</i> with Socrates given what we know of Socrates' reputation [41]) is not  persuasive. This reviewer found the claim that <i style="">akribeia</i> is the most significant force in the dialogue difficult to accept in the absence of a careful discussion of the infamous "longer way" passage, and the claim that the exchange between Socrates and Thrasymachus is the  most spectacular of the dialogue (40) to overstate the case.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Equally unconvincing is Statkiewicz's  characterization of the function of dramatic readings of the dialogues, namely, "to control the character of the text, which it regards as univocal or at least as regularly polysemic" (24), especially when Statkiewicz himself gives  little consideration to such vivid interlocutors as Glaucon and Adeimantus  while making claims about the character of the <i style="">Republic </i>as a whole and when Statkiewicz's own appeals to the dramatic  dimensions of the dialogues suggest there is room for significant exchange between Statkiewicz and these scholars. Many of the authors Statkiewicz surveys  have dedicated volumes to drawing out the rich ambiguities and polyvocity of  the dialogues. Statkiewicz <span style=""> </span>would need to pay more attention to these scholars to convince this reviewer that  they have all failed in their efforts.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">For readers interested in the rich and  long-standing engagement of contemporary continental thought with the Platonic  dialogues, Statkiewicz provides a roadmap to the work of many of this tradition's main figures.  <i style="">Rhapsody of Philosophy</i> is at its strongest when he is illustrating the depth of these theorists' work  with the Platonic dialogues. Statkiewicz's review of feminist work on the <i style="">Timaeus</i> is particularly compelling. Making apparent <i style="">why</i> any of the thinkers he discusses felt the need to give sustained attention to Plato  seems to be of less interest for Statkiewicz. He takes for granted that the  reader will have ready to hand the dense network of philosophic questions that  led these thinkers to turn toward Plato. He spends little time reminding us  what is at stake in these encounters and thus risks closing off our own  engagement with the issues and questions in which he is interested. This is unfortunate  in a book that takes itself to gesture "toward an authentic dialogue between poetry and thought" (169).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The overall effect is thus less a book animated  by questions that can be taken up than one animated by engagements whose  stakes remain mysterious. When, for instance, Statkiewicz asks in chapter 2's discussion of Derrida and Nietzsche, whether the "apparent ambiguity as  to play and woman require a modification of Heidegger's view of Nietzsche's attempt to overturn Platonism and to reconfigure the relationship  between art and truth," (92) this reviewer suspects she is not alone in feeling a  bit lost in the question's winding threads of reference. While I would agree  with Statkiewicz that sorting them out is worth doing, Statkiewicz himself  gives the reader little reason why this is the case, or how to go about doing so.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This is also true for the overall structure of  the book, whose many section titles tell the reader what is happening but not why. Perhaps Statkiewicz would defend this structure on the grounds of the  rhapsodic character of his own writing. This is in fact a move he makes in  justifying the rather sweeping claim that only the rhapsodic reading he champions is  capable of resisting the dominant interpretation of Plato's work on  representation: "The hubris of 'my' claim may perhaps be mitigated by the hubris of another claim: that of the rhapsodic mode to undermine the subjectivity  of the 'I claim' or 'I speak'" (26). But the effect of the book's 'rhapsodic' structure is less an opening of dialogue than a series of observations  whose connections with one another are left unsaid.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the end, in wishing to resist an appeal to  authorial intent while continuing to make claims about Plato's mode of thought and  the possibility for authentic dialogue, Statkiewicz walks a fine line  between illuminating an under-recognized dimension of the dialogues and falling  into a kind of parody that is neither profound nor provocative. There is a  difference between calling into question the standard of authorial intent (a  standard that thinkers like Derrida have so effectively illustrated as fraught and  laden with a variety of less than thoughtful motivations) and denying the  conditions of a work's composition. The former can powerfully illustrate the stultifying  and dangerous effects of claiming privileged access to a text, while the  latter risks mystifying and obfuscating the very conditions through which a  text's polysemia and polyvocity operate.</p>
