    <h4>Joseph Margolis</h4>
	<h2>The Cultural Space of the Arts and the Infelicities of Reductionism</h2>

	 <o:p></o:p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In this book, the indefatigable Joseph Margolis  combines his lifelong interest in works of art as cultural objects with his  theory of persons themselves as cultural objects into a polemic against both  reductionism in the philosophy of mind and what he calls "piecemeal reductionism" in recent aesthetics. What he means by this is that much prominent work  in recent aesthetics, from the philosophies of painting developed by Arthur  Danto, Richard Wollheim, and Kendall Walton to the theories of literary  interpretation put forth by such as Noël Carroll, Jerrold Levinson, and Robert Stecker,  is tacitly based on a philosophy of mind that reduces the intentionality  and intentional behavior of persons to purely physical properties, or extensionality, although the aestheticians do not attempt to defend such general reductionism, and thus, according to Margolis, put forth their  views in aesthetics without adequate metaphysical foundations altogether.
</p><p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The  book is thus divided into two parts, an attack upon "the infelicities of reductionism" in general (the prologue "First Words" and the "Interlude" of chapter 3), which for Margolis is paradigmatically exemplified in the work of Daniel Dennett, and a critique of various of  the positions of the "piecemeal reductionists" in aesthetics (chapters 1-2 and 4-5, separated by the "Interlude" on "Reductionism in the Philosophy of Mind"). I think that Margolis's critique of  reductionism in the philosophy of mind should be taken seriously. But I do not find Margolis's attempt to impute the positions in recent and contemporary aesthetics that he discusses to reductionist, physicalist, or  extensionalist assumptions in the philosophy of mind very convincing, and indeed in  several cases it seems to me that Margolis almost willfully misreads positions  about the cultural and historically-situated character of artworks that are  actually quite close to his own. This is not to say that Margolis does not have  valuable criticisms to make of some of the aesthetic theories he considers,  especially Walton's theory that what we do with works of art is to play games of "make-believe" with them. But it is to say that these theories do not obviously depend upon general reductionism in the philosophy of mind,  and that the success of Margolis's criticisms does not depend on the success of  his general critique of such reductionism.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Since I do not think that Margolis's critique of  recent aesthetics really depends upon his general critique of reductionism, I  will touch on the latter only briefly. Simply put, Margolis's criticism is  that such reductionism is question-begging. For example, Dennett's reduction of  the self to an "intentional standpoint" begs the question of who it is that <i>takes</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that standpoint. In Margolis's words, </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Dennett offers as a  perfectly serious scientific/philosophical conjecture the hypothesis that the <i>brain autonomously  produces a representation of the linked fictions -- self and conscious mind</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> -- that "we," who </span><i>are</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> the fictional entities </span><i>of</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that representation, reflexively regard as  real! (p. 76). </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Margolis holds that such a theory is "fatally circular" because there must be some unified and self-understanding  person that both creates and is taken in by such a fiction -- "the Intentional (fictional) unity of the mind itself" cannot be specified "<i>at the neural or subpersonal level</i><span style="font-style: normal;">,"  Margolis maintains (p. 80) -- but it cannot be a fictional entity that creates  and is taken in by the fiction of the intentionality of a person in all of its manifestations (comprehension, intentional action, etc.). Margolis does  not quite put it this way, but he could have argued that Dennett might have  been taken in by the ease with which we can represent fictional characters  being created by fictional characters in our fictions -- just take any of the innumerable novels about novelists as an examples -- but of course  novels, even novels about fictional novelists creating fictional characters, can only  be written by real novelists. Or if we have gotten to a point where they  can be created by computers, that's only because real people have written the  programs and interpret the output. No doubt Dennett and the other prominent reductionists whom Margolis takes on (David Chalmers, Paul Churchland,  and more) will object. As I say, I find Margolis's objection convincing, but whether it is right or not does not matter to his criticisms of recent positions in aesthetics, because it is not obvious that those positions  really depend upon general reductionism nor that Margolis's objections, when  they are sound, really depend upon general anti-reductionism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">So now for a few examples of Margolis's  objections to recent work in aesthetics. As I mentioned, one group of Margolis's  objections is to what he takes to be the reductionist, physicalist assumptions of  the theories of painting espoused by Arthur Danto (in his 1964 paper "The  Art World" and 1981 book <i>The Transfiguration of the Commonplace</i><span style="font-style: normal;">), Richard Wollheim (in his 1984 Andrew W.  Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, published in 1987 as </span><i>Painting as an  Art</i><span style="font-style: normal;">), and Kendall Walton (in his  1973 article "Pictures and Make-Believe" and his 1990 book </span><i>Mimesis and Make-Believe</i><span style="font-style: normal;">). Margolis's  objections to Danto, Wollheim, and Walton have obviously been simmering for a long  time. Nevertheless, in the first two cases they are in my opinion  unsuccessful, even tendentious objections to theories that are in fact very close to his  own. Margolis's own theory is that works of art are cultural objects, that  is, products of human action or "utterances" in the broadest possible sense, which are embedded in networks of socially and historically  determined meanings that are immediately present to us in our experience of these  objects although not conclusively, incorrigibly, or unrevisably so present. For Margolis, "an artwork </span><i>is</i><span style="font-style: normal;">  the living 'utterance' of a living craftsman who transforms material things  into cultural artifacts that can be vivified again and again through the  various forms of human agency," where "utterance" is "a term of art" that ranges, "without strain, over any and every culturally informed and culturally qualified action and activity, as speaking,  baking bread, making love, dancing, playing the piano, painting a painting," hence, "by an obvious nominalization," it also ranges over "artworks, conversations, actions, deeds, manufactured goods, histories, traditions, institutions" (pp. 56-7). In his view, however, Danto and Wollheim treat paintings (the particular kinds of artworks they happen  to be interested in, though Danto probably assumed them to be paradigmatic for  works of art in general while Wollheim, at least in </span><i>Painting as an  Art</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, less obviously made such an  assumption) as purely physical objects, which we, their audience, in the first instance  experience as such, and to which we only subsequently impute meaning on the basis of conjectures about the artist's intentions that are "external" to our fundamental experience of these objects. On his view, </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">what happens in  Wollheim's account -- and, one way or another, in the accounts of all the  'piecemeal reductionists' -- is this: the real presence of an actual cultural world (including selves and artworks) is simply denied or suppressed or, still  more ingeniously, characterized as derived or projected <i>from data about  artists' minds</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> . . . so that everything  needed in the </span><i>cultural </i><span style="font-style: normal;">way is  thought to be recoverable </span><i>psychologistically</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (p. 31). </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Likewise, according to Margolis, "Danto means to say" that "<i>what</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is actually seen" in seeing a painting "is never more than a physical canvas covered with paint," so that </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">either <i>all</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> the problematic, Intentionally or  culturally freighted attributions we make of </span><i>artworks</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> never answer to what is seen, or else </span><i>to 'see'</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a physical thing </span><i>as</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> an artwork requires an altogether different  sense of 'see,' a figurative sense that is not a mode of actual sensory  perception at all! (p. 39). </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Further, </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Danto simply  collects the data of our powers of phenomenological perception, erases all the  Intentionally freighted perceptual data, and then restores them . . . as whatever (he alleges) belongs to our inner mental life or to what, by reference to  that life, may be imputed to external behavior (p. 41). </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">His basis for these charges is Wollheim's  conception of the "twofoldness" of our experience of painting, the difference between <i>seeing</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a canvas </span><i>as</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a marked surface and </span><i>seeing</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> images </span><i>in</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> those marks, and Danto's method of "indiscernibles," according to which one and the same physical object or kind of physical object may be  seen either as an everyday object or a work of art, a bottle-rack or  Duchamp's "Bottle-Rack," a canvas grounded in red or a painting entitled "Red Square," or one and the same type of physical object may be seen as one artwork or another, "Red Square" or "The Israelites Crossing the Red Sea." Margolis's objection is that these distinctions suppose that we first see the objects at issue as physical objects with  the properties of ordinary sensation, and only then read meaning into them,  by "external" conjectures about the authors' "intentions," which is the opposite of immediately experiencing the "Intentionality" of such objects, their meaningfulness in all sorts of ways, which  Margolis takes to be the true phenomenology of our experience of works of art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">But this objection seems unfair to both the  authors and the facts. In the case of Wollheim, to see an object as a <i>marked  canvas</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, even if one does see it  that way before one sees a figure in it, is already to see it as an artifact, not merely a natural physical object like a cloud (although Wollheim does use the example of  seeing a figure in a cloud to </span><i>illustrate</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> what he means by the "seeing-in" aspect of seeing a painting). And even should we see a painting only as a marked surface, without seeing  any representations in it, as we might for example see a Jackson Pollock,  this is by no means to see it as a merely natural object, like a sheet of rock interestingly patterned by erosion and lichen. So even seeing a painting  merely as a marked surface is already a culturally freighted experience for  Wollheim, and in any case there is nothing in Wollheim to suggest that he thinks  that seeing a painting as a marked surface and seeing something in it are phenomenologically separable experiences; they are for him only  conceptually separable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">What Margolis objects to in Danto is the  distinction between seeing a physical object as such and interpreting it both as a  work of art and as a particular work of art, analogous to the distinction  between seeing a basic action as such, for example, the rising of an arm, and  seeing an intentional and specific action, for example, the raising of an arm, the  aiming of a gun, and so on. But again, Margolis seems to willfully misread as a phenomenological distinction what is pretty clearly intended as a  conceptual distinction. Danto uses the method of indiscernibles precisely to prise  apart the elements of perception and of interpretation that are in fact often  fused in our actual experience of artworks: within a given context, we may immediately experience a painting as meaningful and as meaning something  in particular, but the fact that in another context we could experience the  very same object or sort of object as meaning something else or not meaning  anything at all shows that our ordinarily phenomenologically integral experience  in fact comprises several elements, including both perception and conception,  and for Danto that is precisely what allows our experience of art to be historically freighted and situated, just as Margolis supposes it to be. I say "often fused," however, to allow for the fact that sometimes a work of art may  be so alien or novel to us that at first we can experience it only as a  mere physical object or ordinary thing, and our interpretation of it as a  work of art and as the specific work of art it is is not immediate or automatic.  That is of course often the case with the kind of avant-garde works that  Danto uses to provoke his conceptual analysis (although not always the case for the  more traditional kinds of art that Danto discussed in his vast body of  criticism), and a real possibility in our experience of art that Margolis's  insistence that we always immediately experience works of art with their full range of  meanings neglects.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">So it seems to me that Margolis's criticisms of  Wollheim and Danto work by taking what they intend primarily as conceptual  distinctions and only rarely as phenomenological distinctions as if they were always supposed to be phenomenological. Since both Wollheim and Danto took  their approaches in good part precisely in order to be able to explain how the  whole range of cultural and historical meanings can enter into our experience  of artworks, thereby amplifying the more purely sensory aspects of such experience, it seems to me that Margolis's response to their views is  more a case of sibling rivalry than a genuine objection.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The case is quite different with Margolis's  objection to Walton. Margolis objects to Walton's idea that in general we use works  of art as "props" for games of "make-believe," which he illustrates by supposing that we use paintings such as Seurat's <i>Grand  Jatte</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> or a Hobbema painting of a  mill to "make believe" that we are seeing some lavishly dressed nineteenth-century French  bourgeoise strolling around a pleasure-ground or a seventeenth-century mill from  which a seventeenth-century miller might any moment emerge. Margolis's objection  is that in seeing such paintings we are not playing games or "making believe" at all, but that our experience is phenomenologically much  closer to ordinary perceptual experience than such an idea suggests: "We </span><i>do see</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> the stately world of </span><i>Grand Jatte</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, that is, its represented  world, the painting's world visually represented; although we must of course learn  to see it aright. But we do learn </span><i>to see</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> it in the same perceptual sense . . . that serves us" in ordinary cases (p. 142); and "when I see Hobbema's painting, I myself </span><i>never</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> imagine that I'm seeing an actual mill, as  opposed to seeing a depiction or representation of a mill, though . . . I  readily admit that I do see 'the mill' in the painting" (p. 148). This seems  absolutely right to me. But it also seems to me that it is perfectly well accounted  for by Wollheim's notion of "seeing in," which I take to have been designed to account for precisely this aspect of the phenomenology of aesthetic experience. So I take Margolis's sound objection to Walton only to prove  again the actual affinity of his view of aesthetic experience to that of  Wollheim (and Danto).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Space remains for just a brief comment on  Margolis's response to the theories of literary interpretation of Noël Carroll,  Jerrold Levinson, and Robert Stecker (chapter 5). In spite of having used "conversations" as one of his own examples of the kind of culturally-embedded utterances to which works of art should be  assimilated, Margolis objects to these theories that they rely too heavily on a  Gricean model of conversation, that is, that they treat the interpretation of a literary work like a conversation with a partner who can be assumed to  be expressing a determinate meaning through her words which we can  conclusively determine by a correct conjecture about her intentions -- once again, to  use Margolis's terms and typographical conventions, the intentional becomes external and extensional instead of properly Intentional, and literary interpretation is represented neither as immediate but also not as indeterminate and open-ended as it actually is. I have no room here to  detail the intricacies nor judge the accuracy of Margolis's criticism of the "actual" and "hypothetical" "intentionalisms" of these authors. But it does seem to me that Margolis makes rather heavy  weather out of Stecker's remark (in his 2003 book <i>Interpretation and  Construction</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) that "there are  aspects of the meaning of the poem that it would be natural to say we know prior to interpretation."  For example, with regard to William Blake's poem "The Sick Rose," Stecker says that "We know that the poem is ostensibly about a rose that becomes infested with a worm that destroys it." Margolis objects that </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Stecker conflates  too hastily the meanings we might assign the apparent words and sentences of the  text <i>in contexts other than the context of the poem</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and the meaning of the words gained by interpreting the structure of the  poem or of the words read </span><i>in the context of the poem</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (p. 162). </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Surely there is a difference between the full  meaning of a word in some ordinary context and in some extraordinary poem, but  whether we could reach the latter without starting from the former is by no means  obvious to me, nor is it obvious to me that there is anything wrong with  Stecker's way of putting this point. Once again, while Margolis wants to stress the culturally-embedded and open-ended texture of aesthetic experience, he  also wants to stress the immediacy of aesthetic experience, to make it sound  as if aesthetic experience with all its meanings is always present to us at  once without any process of transition from, for example, the meanings of words in  some ordinary contexts to their meaning in an extraordinary, aesthetic  context, and I do not quite see how these two aims hang together. It seems to me that Stecker's model of starting from ordinary meanings and making a  transition to extraordinary meanings -- although phenomenologically this process might  be either virtually immediate or else protracted -- is a perfectly good  basis for the kind of account of aesthetic experience as both culturally embedded  and yet open-ended that Margolis himself recommends.<o:p></o:p></p>  So I do not think that Margolis's book is a  complete success. I think that his criticism of reductionism in the philosophy of  mind should be taken seriously, and that some but not all of his criticisms  of ideas in recent aesthetics should be taken seriously, but I do not think that  the latter really depend upon the former. But the book is certainly worth  reading by both philosophers of mind and aestheticians -- although of course the difference between these two will sometimes be only conceptual, not phenomenological.
