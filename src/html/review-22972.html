	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-CA">Diverse  readers should find in Jacob Howland's comparative study many appealing features, though its title is  not among them. It implies misleadingly that two vast corpora which have no  obvious relation to each other are to be discussed generally. Howland, however,  wisely concentrates on just two Platonic dialogues -- the <i style="">Apology</i>  and the <i style="">Euthyphro</i> -- and a selection of aggadic (narrative or non-legalistic) material  from chapter three of tractate Ta'anit ("Ritual Fasts") in the Talmud. Their narrative details are analyzed with tremendous historical  erudition, literary acuity, and philosophical enthusiasm. And the results of this exegetical work are not only some rather persuasive interpretations, but  also some thought-provoking comparisons. Among the main analogies that  Howland discovers are that rational inquiry and religious faith are equally  essential to the speeches and deeds of both Socrates and the Talmudic sages; that  both the Platonic dialogues and the Talmud combine dialectical argument with dramatic narratives featuring exemplary figures who mimetically convey  truths about justice and piety that are to be lived as well as known; and that  these texts, which simultaneously uphold and transform traditional, largely  oral religious beliefs and practices, try to involve readers in their  inquiries so that they become participants in a community whose members are bound to  one another and to God or the gods in collaborative inquiry.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-CA">As compelling as these  individual interpretations and comparisons are, however, that judgment does not yet  amount to a positive assessment of the book overall. And that assessment,  furthermore, requires a prior decision about the criterion which should be applied in establishing its merits. Is the right standard a book's own explicit  purpose or ambition? Is it what a book actually offers? Or is it instead what a  book might have undertaken? This review will assess <i>Plato and the Talmud</i>  according to each of these three standards.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-CA">Howland regards as "a fair  test of [his] interpretation . . . whether it helps . . . to disclose some new  levels of meaning in the Platonic dialogues and the Talmud," considering it enough "if the present study stimulates readers to return to these texts with fresh questions, and prepares them to hear some previously  unexpected answers" (p. 22). This test sounds rather modest, but not if viewed against the backdrop of a central claim of his book. Both the Platonic dialogues and the Talmud attempt, according to Howland, not only to draw readers into debates about fundamental moral and theological issues that  do not have final resolutions and so always permit new perspectives, but also  to educate readers for membership in a community of study by conveying the experience of a call to become an active member in this community. If  Howland indeed discloses new levels of meaning in the texts he explains and thus stimulates a fresh return to them, then he will have not only satisfied  his seemingly modest purpose but also practiced successfully what these  texts preach. He is certainly an exemplary reader, modeling throughout an  impressive combination of literary, historical, and philosophical sensitivity to  the narrative details from which the arguments of the <i style="">Apology</i>,  the <i style="">Euthyphro</i><span style="">, and </span>Ta'anit 3  emerge. In chapter five <span style="">("Words and Deeds"), for instance, he examines five stories about different sages whose  various attempts to exemplify a life of Torah are fundamentally incompatible.  Taking the stories as a series, Howland claims that the sages' conflicting  examples establish some basic oppositions (e.g., study vs. business; moderation  vs. extremism; restraint vs. action) and thus open up a field of moral  alternatives that prevent readers from being utterly impressionable and that require  them to think for themselves. Like many of the book's individual claims, this  one about the pedagogy of the Talmud is effectively demonstrated, in addition to  having an obvious appeal for anyone interested in the philosophical merits of  literary forms.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">But the book, Howland's own criterion for assessing it notwithstanding, does  not intend to be merely a spur to and training in actively reading the  Platonic dialogues and the Talmud. His comparative study of select Platonic and  Talmudic writings is, in fact, framed as a response to Leo Strauss' views about  the radical incompatibility of Athens (philosophical rationality) and  Jerusalem (Biblical faith) as intellectual orientations and, more importantly, as  ways of life. His argument contra Strauss is meant to cast a different light on Socratic philosophizing, on the one hand, by situating Socrates' way of  life against the background of the traditional Greek religious beliefs and  practices he transforms, and on Talmudic faith, on the other hand, by showing that  rabbis strive to extend human understanding by means of rational inquiry. It is  this relationship between reason and faith common to both traditions that  largely guides Howland's selection of the few texts from the two large corpora  on which he draws, though certainly each deals with a plethora of other topics  that he might have tackled instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">At one level, of course, some such choice faces every comparative  philosophical study; at another level, however, the choice can be made more or less explicitly into a methodological problem, the reflection on which can  often lead to more nuanced and cautious conclusions. Howland reflects very  little on the methodological question about the commensurability of Athens and  Jerusalem. He asks whether Strauss' claims about the incommensurability of "Greek philosophy and the Bible leave[s] room for . . . a meaningful comparison between Plato and the Talmud" (p. 4), but this question itself obscures a concern about a methodological sort of incommensurability which Howland  should, and Strauss need not, raise. One could perhaps maintain that Strauss  should have been more critical in taking over Tertullian's question of what  Athens has to do with Jerusalem. After all, unlike Tertullian, Strauss is concerned  not with defending the essence of Christianity from philosophically  influenced heresies but with defining quite generally the essence of philosophy in contrast to the essence of faith. But, precisely for this reason, he can  ignore the methodological question about the grounds on which Athens and  Jerusalem can be adequately compared, since they are together shorthand for a  fundamental existential problem and only tangentially designate the actual literary  works of the peoples identified with each of these two cities. The same cannot  be said for Howland's concern with Athens and Jerusalem as two historically distinct textual traditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Howland could be right that Athens and Jerusalem, as concretized in the Platonic dialogues and the Talmud respectively, might each hold that rational  inquiry begins with a revelation (i.e., God's words at Mount Sinai and the  Delphic oracle's mysterious claim about Socrates) and that human wisdom must  accept unsurpassable limits. But this agreement does not mean that each  tradition understands by its sort of "faith" or "piety" anything like what the other tradition does. Incommensurability in the meanings of  such fundamental terms differs from incommensurability between two ways of  life which are incommensurable simply in the sense that a person could not  live both with complete allegiance, not in the sense that they might be mutually unintelligible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">The possibility that Athens and Jerusalem are mutually unintelligible does  not seem to be on Howland's radar (or on Strauss' either, for that matter).  Howland, it must be noted, does observe profound differences between the two  traditions. For example, he notes that there is no analogue in Socratic  philosophizing to the miraculous intervention of God in human life described in the Bible  and Talmud and that Plato cannot assume, as the Talmud generally can, a  readership that already accepts its basic religious outlook. But he observes such differences between the two traditions within the context of his study's  basic assumption that these differences occur against a common, perhaps even universal, backdrop. This assumption is nowhere even acknowledged, let  alone substantiated. In view of this omission, the autonomous understanding  and pious obedience that, according to Howland, both play roles in Socratic philosophizing and Talmudic inquiry might point to a superficial  resemblance rather than a profound similarity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">The methodological shortcomings of Howland's comparative analysis raise  questions not only about how he might have proceeded otherwise, but also about  what other aim he might have pursued. Upon seeing the title of Howland's book, one  cannot help but reflect on the Platonic dialogues' standard prominence in and  the Talmud's typical absence from philosophical curricula in the present as  well as the past. One reason for this difference is no doubt that philosophy is identified with Athens and that something other than philosophy -- be it  faith or revelation -- with Jerusalem, whence it follows that neither the  Bible nor the Talmud has any place in the philosophical curriculum because it  simply is not philosophy. Howland's comparative analysis could help change this perception. It cannot, however, alter another perception that has  historically kept the Talmud out of the philosophical curriculum, namely, the  apparent parochialism of the Talmud. Indeed, Howland himself makes a similar  charge. Whereas the theme of the relationship between faith and reason  determines entirely which Platonic dialogues will be his focus, he selects Talmudic passages based not only on their relevance to this theme but also on  whether they are likely to appeal to people other than religious Jews. He  explains that, <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">while Talmudic debate on matters of halakha [Jewish law] is rich with philosophical implications, it is on the whole  of limited interest to readers who are not observant Jews. Aggadah,  however, has the kind of universal appeal and accessibility that characterizes both  Hebrew Scriptures and the Platonic dialogues . . . [and are] the primary means  by which the Talmud is able to draw readers of all faiths and backgrounds  into reflection and debate on humanly fundamental issues (p. 17). <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Howland might be right in this assessment that all of Plato's dialogues have  universal appeal while large sections of the Talmud are of interest only to a  particular group. But one could reply that, for this very reason, an approach is  needed that would win the Talmud a wider audience, even universalize it -- though  not by illicitly integrating it into a superficial universalism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">An alternative to comparative analysis seems to be the sort of translation  that Emmanuel Levinas understands as a <span style="">transition from Hebrew particularity to Greek universality and that he moreover </span>derives from  rabbinic tradition itself. Commenting on a passage from the Talmud in which an obligation of the Israelites to translate "very clearly" their experience into all the languages of the world is under  discussion, Levinas writes: <span style="">"We have not yet finished translating the Bible. The Septuagint is incomplete. Nor have  we finished translating the Talmud. We have hardly begun. And as far as the  Talmud is concerned, it must be said how delicate the task is!"</span></span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-CA"><span style="">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style="" lang="EN-CA"> The task's delicacy, Levinas implies, lies in the all too hasty manner in  which Talmudic thought might pass into foreign languages without being  liberated from its unusual form, on the one hand, and without expressing its particular content on the other. So, even though it might make its way into other languages, the Talmud would not yet be translated in either of these two  events since translation means, according to the Talmudic passage cited by  Levinas, the enrichment of foreign idioms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Can the Talmud, as  Levinas hopes, enrich universal philosophical idioms? Readers will not find clear instances of this sort  of enrichment in Howland's limited comparison of a few select <i>aggadot</i>  with a couple of Platonic dialogues. But they will find in his charming book  not only interesting and informative analyses of these texts, but also an  example of what one ought to do in tackling these texts oneself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
