	D.M. Armstrong's latest book, <i>Truth and Truthmakers</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, is a formidable yet compact treatise on the metaphysics of truthmaking.<span style="">  </span>It will be widely studied and hotly debated by contemporary analytic metaphysicians. </span>  <p class="MsoBodyText">In this book, Armstrong is concerned to explicate the relation between a truth and what makes the truth true.<span style="">  </span>Appropriately enough, Armstrong calls this relation the "truthmaking relation."<span style="">  </span>He defends the following claims about the truthmaking relation:</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(1) The truthmaking relation is (primarily) a relation between a <i>proposition </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and something (typically) non-propositional, specifically, the thing that makes the proposition true. (5, 12-16)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(2) The truthmaking relation is an <i>internal </i><span style="font-style: normal;">relation: the truthmaking relation is necessitated by the qualitative character of the things it relates. (9)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(3) <i>Truthmaker Maximalism</i><span style="font-style: normal;">:<span style="">  </span>For any true proposition </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, there is an </span><i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">that makes </span><i>p </i><span style="font-style: normal;">true. (5-7)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(4) <i>Truthmaker Necessitarianism</i><span style="font-style: normal;">: </span><i><span style=""> </span></i><span style="font-style: normal;">If </span><i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">makes </span><i>p </i><span style="font-style: normal;">true, then, necessarily, if </span><i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists, then </span><i>p </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is true. (5-7)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In addition to defending claims about the truthmaking relation, Armstrong also advances several interesting claims about the <i>relata</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of the truthmaking relation. Chapter one is an introduction; chapter two contains a discussion of Armstrong's theory of propositions; chapter three addresses the methodological and epistemological issues associated with truthmaking theory; chapter four provides an extended account of Armstrong's new theory of properties, objects, and states of affairs; chapters five and six discuss Armstrong's account of the truthmakers for negative and general truths, e.g., "There is no cat on the carpet" and "all philosophers are charming"; chapters seven and eight deal with Armstrong's minimalist theory of modality; chapter nine concerns itself with the ontology of mathematics; chapter ten deals with causation and the nature of laws of nature; finally, chapter eleven discusses the metaphysics of time.<span style="">  </span>And all in only one-hundred and seventy pages -- counting the references and the index! -- and all written in Armstrong's trademark clear, even-handed, and unpretentious style. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Philosophers will have much to learn from this book, and they may teach from it as well.<span style="">  </span>In addition to advancing the debate, <i>Truth and Truthmaking</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> contains a lot of helpful expository material. Each chapter clarifies the issues with which it deals. Armstrong's positions and those with which he contends are nicely presented and carefully contrasted.<span style="">  </span>The book could be used in a graduate metaphysics seminar or even an advanced undergraduate philosophy class.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">I'll concentrate the remainder of this review on the accounts of propositions, properties, and objects defended in this rich and stimulating book.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Propositions<o:p></o:p></i></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Armstrong takes propositions to be the primary bearers of truth-values.<span style="">  </span>Propositions are one of the relata of the truthmaking relation.<span style="">  </span>As noted above, Armstrong holds that the truthmaking relation is an <i>internal </i><span style="font-style: normal;">relation, i.e., a relation that supervenes on the qualitative character of its relata.<span style="">  </span>Armstrong notes that this fact rules out some candidates for being propositions: "how can truthmakers necessitate truthbearers if the truthbearers are beliefs, statements, and so on?" (15) So what then are </span><i>propositions</i><span style="font-style: normal;">?</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Armstrong's answer to this question is difficult to assess. He considers several answers en route to his final view.<span style="">  </span>Rejected candidates include: Platonic entities outside the realm of space-time, sets of sentences and beliefs equivalent in meaning or content, and properties of beliefs and sentences, which could be thought of as the <i>meanings </i><span style="font-style: normal;">of the sentences or beliefs.<span style="">  </span>Armstrong is attracted to the last of these options, but notes that this view is problematic: some of these properties must be uninstantiated.<span style="">  </span>This is because there are true propositions that have never been entertained let alone believed or expressed; accordingly, these true propositions cannot be identified with properties of actual beliefs or sentences.<span style="">  </span>One option is to hold that these propositions are properties that possible beliefs or sentences could instantiate.<span style="">  </span>But Armstrong tells us that we should not accept uninstantiated properties. (15) However, Armstrong hopes to give us a </span><i>deflationary </i><span style="font-style: normal;">account of uninstantiated properties, which he claims we could accept:</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Properties of things are, I think, <i>ways </i><span style="font-style: normal;">that things are, and the notion of a way that nothing is seems ontologically near unintelligible.<span style="">  </span>I would find an account of unexpressed properties acceptable only if a deflationary account of these uninstantiated properties is given.<span style="">  </span>We can do this deflation, I hope, by equating these uninstantiated properties with the </span><i>mere possibility</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of the instantiation of such a property.<span style="">  </span>It will then be necessary, of course, to consider what the truthmakers are for these truths of mere possibility. (15-16)</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">What is perplexing about Armstrong's position is that, strictly speaking, he does not believe in <i>mere possibilities</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>One can say that the fat man in the doorway is a mere possibility without committing oneself to a merely possible object; one simply expresses that it is possible that there is a fat man in the doorway.<span style="">  </span>Similarly, one who holds that uninstantiated properties are mere possibilities is committed to nothing more than it being possible that certain properties are instantiated. (See p. 87 for more discussion of this issue.)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">So if one holds that some propositions are uninstantiated properties, which are in turn taken to be mere possibilities, then it seems that one should say that, strictly speaking, there aren't these propositions.<span style="">  </span>Consider some far-away star that no one ever has or ever will contemplate.<span style="">  </span>We would like to say that there are propositions about this star, such as the proposition that the star is burning at a particular intensity.<span style="">  </span>This proposition is taken by Armstrong to be an uninstantiated property, a property that possible beliefs or sentences could have.<span style="">  </span>But none of these items -- uninstantiated properties, possible beliefs or sentences, and possible but non-actual properties -- are in Armstrong's official ontology; there is no object that Armstrong believes in that can be <i>identified </i><span style="font-style: normal;">with the proposition that the star is burning is at a particular intensity, just as there is no object in Armstrong's official ontology that can be identified with a possible fat man in my doorway.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">And if these propositions aren't actually in the ontology, then they don't stand in internal relations to things that actually are in the ontology.<span style="">  </span>Compare: since there are no merely possible fat people, there are no merely possible fat people that are taller than me. (Even though it is of course true that it is possible that a fat person is taller than me.)<span style="">  </span>So in many cases, one of the relata of the truthmaking relation will be absent from the ontology. So it is hard to see how the truthmaking relation can be an internal relation.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Properties and Objects<o:p></o:p></i></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Armstrong's views on the nature of properties and objects have profoundly changed since his last book.<span style="">  </span>Armstrong now holds the following:</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(1) If an object <i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">instantiates a property </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, then </span><i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>F </i><span style="font-style: normal;">are </span><i>partially identical</i><span style="font-style: normal;">; they share a common constituent. (47) Armstrong extends this principle to relations as well (49, 52, 126); see also Armstrong 2005, p. 318. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(2) If <i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>y </i><span style="font-style: normal;">are partially identical, then, necessarily, </span><i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists if and only if </span><i>y </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists. (47)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">These are powerful claims.<span style="">  </span>Suppose <i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">instantiates </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">; given these claims, necessarily, </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists if and only if </span><i>F </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists.<span style="">  </span>Because of this, Armstrong holds that states of affairs are no longer needed as "ontological additions"; the existence of the state of affairs in which </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is </span><i>F </i><span style="font-style: normal;">supervenes on the existence of </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. (48-49) Armstrong also hopes that appealing to (1) and (2) will help solve puzzles about the nature of the laws of nature. (126-136)<span style="">       </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Armstrong's motivations for adopting (1) and (2) are not explained in much depth; with respect to (1), he tells us that he has been convinced by Donald Baxter (2001) that it is true and leaves things at that.<span style="">  </span>He does not provide much of an argument for (2); he writes:</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Suppose <i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">to be F, with F a universal. If this state of affairs is contingent, then it might not have existed.<span style="">  </span>Suppose it had not existed.<span style="">  </span>The particular </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, the particular with all its non-relational properties, would not have existed.<span style="">  </span>Something quite like it could have existed instead: a particular with all of </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;">'s properties except F.<span style="">  </span>But that would have only been a close counterpart of a, because the intersection with F, the partial identity with F, would be lacking.<span style="">  </span></span><i>Equally</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>it now seems to me that the universal F would not have existed.<span style="">  </span></i><span style="font-style: normal;">A universal very like F could have existed: a universal that had the same instantiations as F except for its instantiating </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. (47)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">There are two problems with this defense.<span style="">  </span>First, as an argument for (2), it seems question-begging.<span style="">  </span>In general, it doesn't seem that if two things are partially identical, then they are strongly modally interconnected.<span style="">  </span>A piece of flesh on the tip of my finger and me are partially identical; but it certainly seems as though I could exist without the piece of flesh existing.<span style="">  </span>Why should the situation be different when the two entities in question are a universal and its instantiator?<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Second, and more seriously, given (1) and (2), most of the quoted paragraph is false.<span style="">  </span>Grant (1) and (2), and consider an <i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">that is </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>G</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and </span><i>H</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>If the property F had not existed, not only would </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">not have existed, but </span><i>G </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>H </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and any other property had by </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">would not have existed either.<span style="">  </span></span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>F </i><span style="font-style: normal;">are partially identical and so are </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>G</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. So, necessarily, </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists if and only if </span><i>F </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists; and, similarly, </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists if and only if </span><i>G </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists.<span style="">  </span>So </span><i>F </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists if and only if </span><i>G </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists, and so forth for any property had by </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>So if </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">had not existed, there would not have been a "close counterpart" of </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, one that had all of </span><i>a's </i><span style="font-style: normal;">properties save for </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>None of </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;">'s properties would have existed!<span style="">  </span>Moreover, if </span><i>F </i><span style="font-style: normal;">had not existed, no "close counterpart" of </span><i>F </i><span style="font-style: normal;">would have existed.<span style="">  </span>Suppose </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>b</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>c</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and </span><i>d</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> all instantiate </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Suppose </span><i>b, c, </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>d </i><span style="font-style: normal;">all instantiate </span><i>H</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>By similar reasoning, necessarily, </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">exists if and only if </span><i>b</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>c</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and </span><i>d</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> exist; H exists only if </span><i>b</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>c</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and </span><i>d</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> exists.<span style="">  </span>So if </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">doesn't exist, then </span><i>H </i><span style="font-style: normal;">doesn't exist either.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">If (1) and (2) are right, then the world suffers from a disturbing interconnectivity.<span style="">  </span>Elsewhere, Armstrong has indicated his willingness to extend the doctrine of partial identity to cover particulars standing in relations to each other.<span style="">  </span>Presumably, Armstrong holds that everything is spatiotemporally related to everything else, since this seems to follow from his naturalism. This seems to imply that every particular object is partially identical to every other particular object.<span style="">  </span>Given (2), had I not been born, you never would have existed.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, had I not been born, <i>no property instantiated by anything in this universe would have existed</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and hence, </span><i>nothing in this universe would have existed</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.
