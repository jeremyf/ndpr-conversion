	<p class="MsoBodyText">Mark Reiff's <i>Punishment, Compensation, and Law </i><span style="font-style: normal;">certainly is original.<span style="">  </span>I intend this remark as high praise.<span style="">  </span>Most books about punishment and compensation are maddeningly predictable and repetitive.<span style="">  </span>They recite standard objections to familiar theories, add a new twist here or there, and defend an alternative no more plausible than those they reject.<span style="">  </span>Reiff is doing something very different, and even those readers who have thought long and hard about the philosophical foundations of punishment and compensation will be challenged to come to terms with his ideas.<span style="">  </span>Since Reiff poses questions and provides answers that are new, any legal philosopher interested in these matters will be stimulated by his unusual perspective.<span style="">  </span>Although I sometimes wonder whether there really </span><i>is</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a single theme under which he can subsume each of the several topics he examines, Reiff unquestionably has taken a novel approach to many important but frequently unaddressed problems in the philosophy of law.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Much of the originality is due to the distinctive set of questions Reiff addresses.<span style="">  </span>Most discussions of punishment and compensation involve issues of justification.<span style="">  </span>Theorists struggle to formulate and defend principles of retributive and compensatory justice.<span style="">  </span>But Reiff is less interested in matters of justification than in distinct but related considerations about the <i>enforceability </i><span style="font-style: normal;">of restraints (mostly but not only rights).<span style="">  </span>At its most abstract level, Reiff's central question is "how much enforcement is required to make a restraint operative in the world." (p.3)<span style="">  </span>Obviously, </span><i>operative </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is the key word here.<span style="">  </span>According to Reiff, restraints are operative (or meaningful) when they achieve their goals.<span style="">  </span>A right that is enforceable according to his consequentialist criteria qualifies as </span><i>genuine</i><span style="font-style: normal;">; otherwise, it is merely a </span><i>nominal</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> right.<span style="">  </span>Nominal rights are not altogether insignificant, as Reiff assures us in a brief concluding chapter.<span style="">  </span>Still, there can be no doubt that he believes enforceability is the key to making restraints meaningful in the real world.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Reiff proposes to keep issues of whether restraints are enforceable distinct from questions about what restraints we should impose.<span style="">  </span>This separation makes analytical sense, but renders his project somewhat less interesting than it might have been (at least to me).<span style="">  </span>Difficulties in imagining acceptable means of enforcing restraints against the use of contraceptives, for example, were instrumental in persuading the Supreme Court to find these restraints in violation of a constitutional right of privacy.<span style="">  </span>These issues remain in the forefront of political and legal debate in the United States.<span style="">  </span>But this is not the direction Reiff chooses to pursue.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Reiff's most important insight is that the goals of enforceability differ depending on whether we are in a <i>pre</i><span style="font-style: normal;">violation or </span><i>post</i><span style="font-style: normal;">violation state of affairs.<span style="">  </span>(He also discusses a </span><i>postenforcement </i><span style="font-style: normal;">stage, but it plays a much smaller role in his argument.)<span style="">  </span>Begin with previolation enforceability.<span style="">  </span>Inspired by Hobbes, Reiff asks us to imagine a possible world in which some or all of our rights are unenforceable.<span style="">  </span>Since many of the advantages of social life would be impossible in such a place, Reiff maintains that the general goal of previolation enforceability should be to facilitate social cooperation.<span style="">  </span>Rights become meaningful when this level of enforcement is achieved.<span style="">  </span>It would be mistaken to suppose that this goal is reached when sanctions are sufficient to deter potential violators.<span style="">  </span>Instead, Reiff claims that the attainment of this goal must be assessed from the perspective of the rights beneficiary.<span style="">  </span>In other words, social cooperation is facilitated when beneficiaries rationally believe that potential violators will prefer not to enter the postviolation state, and thus behave </span><i>as if </i><span style="font-style: normal;">the probability of violation were acceptable to them.<span style="">  </span>Besides deterring violators, another way to encourage rational beneficiaries to undertake the risks of cooperation is by promising them enough compensation to make them indifferent to the possibility that a violation will occur.<span style="">  </span>For a variety of principled and practical reasons that Reiff describes in lucid detail, however, genuine indifference is nearly impossible to produce.<span style="">  </span>Thus the promise of compensation will seldom be sufficient to render a right enforceable in the previolation world, and threats of punishment often must do the job.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The goal of enforcement changes, however, after a violation of rights has taken place.<span style="">  </span>In the postviolation stage, a system of enforcement should not try to facilitate social cooperation as much as to contain subsequent conflict, making it minimally disruptive to the social fabric.<span style="">  </span>Thus an effective system of postviolation enforcement must satisfy the victim's instinct for retaliation while promoting containment rather than expansion of the conflict.<span style="">  </span>The key to containment is <i>acceptance </i><span style="font-style: normal;">of the results by both violators and beneficiaries.<span style="">  </span>Among the more controversial parts of Reiff's book is his claim about how much punishment retributivists should require in the postviolation stage in order for acceptance to occur.<span style="">  </span>Reiff rejects the familiar idea that the severity of punishment should be proportionate to the seriousness of the crime.<span style="">  </span>Instead, he argues that rights are enforceable in the postviolation world when the severity of punishment is proportionate to the degree of suffering caused by the violation.<span style="">  </span>This measure of retribution, he contends, should be acceptable to rational violators and beneficiaries alike because of </span><i>reciprocity</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>That is, "the violator is not only a violator of this particular right, he is also the beneficiary of a great many other rights. . . He therefore has reason to view this amount of enforcement as just and accept his punishment." (p.144)<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It is hard to tell whether Reiff has correctly identified the sorts of considerations that actually account for the tendency of violators and beneficiaries to accept the severity of sanctions, and thus to preserve a stable society over time.<span style="">  </span>He draws heavily from game theory to support his claims, but we all know that ordinary persons depart radically from the models of rationality presupposed by economic models.<span style="">  </span>The real world is far more messy.<span style="">  </span>How often do people actually resort to vigilante justice, and why don't they do so more or less frequently?<span style="">  </span>How much confidence in the efficacy of law enforcement must citizens lose before social cooperation is threatened?<span style="">  </span>How do attitudes about the enforceability of particular rights affect views about the enforceability of whole systems of rights?<span style="">  </span>Although Reiff generally seems to be making empirical claims about the forces that enhance or undermine social stability, his project is strangely devoid of empirical data.<span style="">  </span>What really happens when the police go on strike, the jails are emptied, the electricity fails, or the occupying conquerors arrest all of the judges and politicians?<span style="">  </span>How does the conduct of adolescents differ when they believe adults are not watching, and why don't they simply do whatever brings them immediate gratification?<span style="">  </span>How fast do drivers go when specific speed limits are repealed, and how does the reintroduction of speed limits alter their behavior?<span style="">  </span>Perhaps we have too little real-world experience with systems of norms that do not adequately contain the social conflict that might be anticipated if restraints were widely regarded as unenforceable.<span style="">  </span>But I am skeptical that our philosophical armchairs provide a good vantage point from which we can understand the variables that help to attain the goals of social stability and the containment of social conflict.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Reiff's ambition is to produce a unified and comprehensive theory of enforceability.<span style="">  </span>Indeed, his view <i>is</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> admirably comprehensive in many respects, most notably in its coverage of both criminal and civil law.<span style="">  </span>Most theorists treat these realms as almost completely distinct, governed by different principles of justice.<span style="">  </span>Reiff, however, offers an intriguing hypothesis about the connection between punishment and compensation.<span style="">  </span>In the previolation state of affairs, the availability of compensation will render a restraint enforceable only occasionally.<span style="">  </span>Compensation plays a far more central role in explaining postviolation enforceability.<span style="">  </span>In the postenforcement state of affairs, some amount of compensation can reduce the quantum of punishment needed to make a right enforceable.<span style="">  </span>Any reservations we are likely to have about allowing the payment of compensation to reduce the amount of punishment required probably derive from our failure to keep questions of enforceability distinct from questions of justification.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">But Reiff's discussion strikes me as less than comprehensive in another sense.<span style="">  </span>It is largely inapplicable, I think, to many and perhaps most of the restraints imposed by our legal system today.<span style="">  </span>Reiff's proposal to assess many questions of enforceability from the<i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">perspective of the rights beneficiary presupposes that such a person exists.<span style="">  </span>As Reiff is aware, however, many of the laws enforced most commonly against individuals under existing law lack an identifiable rights beneficiary.<span style="">  </span>What does it mean, for example, for restraints on acts of solicitation and conspiracy to be enforceable?<span style="">  </span>But we need not focus on inchoate offenses to appreciate the limited scope of Reiff's analysis.<span style="">  </span>How should we decide whether restraints on such activities as illicit drug distribution are enforceable?<span style="">  </span>Consider the kinds of questions that might have arisen had Reiff kept this latter example in mind.<span style="">  </span>Is a restraint enforceable in a meaningful and operative sense when it is applied with a great deal of discretion, and selectively invoked against minorities in particular?<span style="">  </span>Might one and the same restraint be enforceable in one community but not in another?<span style="">  </span>Could enforcement actually do more to undermine than to facilitate social cooperation?<span style="">  </span>Are the real goals of enforcing this restraint more sinister than Reiff acknowledges?<span style="">  </span>At what point do we concede that efforts to enforce given restraints have failed?<span style="">  </span>Despite his claims to comprehensiveness, Reiff's theory, as far as I can tell, lacks the resources to answer such questions.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Although Reiff frequently seeks to identify the practical implications of his ambitious project, I would be more inclined to recommend this book to academic theoreticians than to makers of public policy.<span style="">  </span>Each of Reiff's discussions displays an impressive wealth of philosophical sophistication.<span style="">  </span>But the whole endeavor is so riddled with qualifications and refinements that I fear it becomes largely inapplicable to those entrusted with shaping policy in the real world.<span style="">  </span>He admits, for example, that we are almost always in the previolation and postviolation stages simultaneously.<span style="">  </span>To his great credit, Reiff is aware of nearly all of these complexities, and adds several distinctions that readers may not have been inclined to draw.<span style="">  </span>Despite these concessions, he cannot quite bring himself to admit that most of his exercise is academic.<span style="">  </span>On a scholarly level, at least, Reiff has produced a valuable and original contribution to our understanding of whether and under what conditions given restraints can be said to be enforceable.</p>
