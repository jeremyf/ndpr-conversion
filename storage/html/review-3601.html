	<p class="MsoBodyText">The strongest point made by this creatively written book is that the very idea of cultural relativism depends on a questionable notion of culture, according to which a culture is very much like a philosophical system.<span style="">  </span>However, the relationship between these arguments about cultural relativism and much of the rest of the book, including the informative discussion of Islamic revivalism, is not always clear.<span style="">  </span>The book as a whole is uneven in quality and the various parts of it do not all hang together.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In his introduction, Cahoone complains that in most writings on culture, there is no good philosophical definition of this concept.<span style="">  </span>Lacking such a definition, there is no way to tell where one culture ends and the next begins.<span style="">  </span>Although he is sure that nothing we ever do or say transcends our culture, he does not think that this implies cultural relativism.<span style="">  </span>In order to show this, he then seeks to clarify the notion of culture.<span style="">  </span>The first two chapters are devoted to reviewing and critiquing the literature on culture and its relation to liberal political values.<span style="">  </span>He then adopts a more restricted sense of culture than is usually found in the social sciences, defining it as a system of goals or ends.<span style="">  </span>The third chapter then explores the notion of cultural identity and compares it to race, ethnicity, family, and other such notions.<span style="">  </span>In the next couple of chapters, he takes a detour to examine the ideas of modernity and postmodernity.<span style="">  </span>Chapter six returns to a discussion of culture as a system of ends and compares it to play.<span style="">  </span>The seventh chapter contains his key arguments disarming the threat of cultural relativism.<span style="">  </span>In the eighth chapter, Cahoone draws on the history of Islamic movements from the very beginning to argue that recent Islamic revivalism should be understood as a form of modernism rather than as a return to the past.<span style="">  </span>The universalizing tendency of modernism in the Islamic world did not take the form of a turn from tribalism to nationalism, as it did in the West.<span style="">  </span>Instead, it turned to religion.<span style="">  </span>Its refusal to distinguish political from religious authority reflects a desire for logical consistency comparable to that of Enlightenment rationalism.<span style="">  </span>By way of contrast, the Euroamerican West is characterized by hypocrisy.<span style="">  </span>He generalizes this point about Islam in the conclusion, stating that there are in fact many ways to be modern.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In the trenchant seventh chapter, Cahoone argues that the very notion of cultural relativism assumes that a culture constitutes some sort of integrated whole. <span style=""> </span>To think of a belief as culturally determined rather than based on reason and evidence is to presuppose that a culture's beliefs are unified through resting on some subset of fundamental cultural assumptions in the same way that a philosophical system rests on its metaphysical foundations.<span style="">  </span>This kind of systematicity is also supposed to define or provide limits or borders to the culture.<span style="">  </span>Cultural relativism results from raising skeptical questions concerning the warrant for the first principles of one's own culture.<span style="">  </span>However, Cahoone finds Descartes's foundationalism a poor metaphor for how a culture's beliefs relate to each other and the world, preferring something more like a crystal lattice or a network of plants with an interconnected root system.<span style="">  </span>He thinks the burden of proof rests with those who believe that cultures are tightly integrated wholes.<span style="">  </span>For Cahoone, there is no specific philosophical problem of cultural relativism; extending the same line of reasoning to moral as well as cognitive realism, he says that the justification of beliefs and values remains one and the same philosophical problem with or without the notion of culture.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Cahoone also thinks that the notion of a framework that encloses a system of beliefs makes a poor metaphor for a culture.<span style="">  </span>For this author, there are no clear boundaries to a culture and beliefs are not culturally bound.<span style="">  </span>He finds as much variability within cultures as between them.<span style="">  </span>Even within the same culture, people can have completely opposed metaphysical beliefs, and yet share innumerable other beliefs, making communication possible between them.<span style="">  </span>A similar overlap makes intercultural communication possible.<span style="">  </span>He rejects the thesis of the incommensurability of meaning, holding instead that different networks of meaning may refer to the same objects.<span style="">  </span>As he understands it, the Quinean indeterminacy of translation argument does not imply that there are no constraints whatsoever on translation.<span style="">  </span>Furthermore, as others have also pointed out, translation and understanding are not the same thing anyway.<span style="">  </span>As Cahoone argues, it is precisely the bilingual person who is in the best position to point out when a phrase is not translatable.<span style="">  </span>He also points out that cultures have always been in contact with one another, even living side-by-side.<span style="">  </span>Cross-cultural communication, according to Cahoone, is not a philosophical but rather a practical, political problem.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In a somewhat weaker argument, Cahoone also says that relativism cannot make sense of our actual behavior.<span style="">  </span>That is, in the pursuit of any sort of inquiry, whether scientific or common-sense, people act as if contradictory claims to truth are a problem.<span style="">  </span>But that may just be how people act.<span style="">  </span>Perhaps his better argument is that if we were to adopt relativism, we would have to give up "inquiry as we understand it" (171).<span style="">  </span>Instead, he recommends a minimal realism, according to which all truth-claims must be mutually consistent.<span style="">  </span>He believes this realism is necessary, even if he cannot provide a non-circular justification for it.<span style="">  </span>Finally, he reasons that social constructivism is untenable, for if it were true, we would have constructed a much better world for ourselves.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Although this chapter contains some good arguments, there are ways in which it could have been made stronger.<span style="">  </span>His arguments against relativism are addressed to an older literature, including works by Winch, Quine, Gadamer, and Kuhn.<span style="">  </span>There is no recognition of the more recent debates over relativism and constructivism that have arisen in the science studies disciplines or of the attempts by philosophers such as Hacking, Kitcher, and Longino to reconcile the social and cultural with the rational character of scientific knowledge.<span style="">  </span>Also, the relationship of this chapter to much of the rest of the book is not entirely clear.<span style="">  </span>It seems as if the author could have skipped from chapter two directly to chapter seven.<span style="">  </span>Nor is it apparent how this chapter leads into the following chapter on Islamic revivalism, which although interesting in its own right, could just about stand on its own without all that has gone before.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The middle chapters, especially the two about modernism and postmodernism, are the weakest part of the book.<span style="">  </span>Here we find stage theories of historical development and other such sweeping generalizations that philosophy should have left behind long ago.<span style="">  </span>The author also lapses into jargon.<span style="">  </span>Page after page goes by where it is not clear what he means or how to tell whether what he says is true.<span style="">  </span>The claims he makes about history and society are essentially empirical claims for which he offers little supporting evidence.<span style="">  </span>For instance, he claims that the distinction between the truth of a speech act and its social legitimacy is very recent and did not exist for pre-modern society, asserts that there was no sphere of public discourse in the middle ages, and descries a trend in which the local public realm matters less and less.<span style="">  </span>Often his claims contain such ill-defined terms that it is not clear what evidence would count for or against them, as when he detects a trend towards the "obsolescence" of culture, or at least what is left of the culture once we subtract the mass media (93).<span style="">  </span>At first he says that this does not mean that it is being colonized by mass culture or that it is shrinking, but then on the following page he seems to suggest that it is a matter of colonization after all.<span style="">  </span>One is left wondering just what the obsolescence of culture could possibly mean.<span style="">  </span>Perhaps it appears to be becoming obsolete to the author only because he had adopted earlier a very restricted idea of culture, which, although it includes more than language, does not include, for instance, higher mathematics and screwdrivers -- for reasons that are not entirely clear.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In some of the other surprising claims that he makes in these middle chapters, it is simply not clear who he is talking about, as for example when he affirms that today, unlike in the eighteenth century, nobody values culture except as something to be consumed.<span style="">  </span>It is notoriously difficult to measure attitudes even among living populations, let alone those of centuries ago, and it is not at all clear what populations he has in mind.<span style="">  </span>As a case in point, he believes that school children today learn that culture does not matter:<span style="">  </span>that it is all the same whether one reads Shakespeare or watches sitcoms.<span style="">  </span>But of course one hundred years ago most children never went beyond elementary school, and one hundred years before that fewer still got even that far.<span style="">  </span>Similarly, he claims that the Aristotelian and Newtonian ontologies could be socially assimilated, while the ontology of twentieth-century physics could not, even among the educated.<span style="">  </span>But one wonders what part of the population in the past was able to assimilate even these older ontologies.<span style="">  </span>One could argue that there are Newtonian and Galilean concepts, such as inertia and the composition of motions, that are still not generally understood even today, and that the common-sense worldview is closer to medieval impetus theory.<span style="">  </span>Finally, he maintains that the postmodern era reflects a return to culture, authority, and society, and away from the modern concern with reason, experience, and nature.<span style="">  </span>Again, just who is he talking about?<span style="">  </span>The common man?<span style="">  </span>The educated elite?<span style="">  </span>Just the humanists and social scientists?<span style="">   </span>After all, something like a million scientific papers are published every year, and one can hardly detect in them a turning away from reason, experience, and nature.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">At some point, hypotheses in social theory must be submitted to empirical control.<span style="">  </span>It seems that Cahoone's justificatory strategy is instead to persuade reader's that his speculations cohere with their general impressions of society, culture, and history, or with similar speculations produced by other social theorists.<span style="">  </span>But why should we regard our impressions as trustworthy?<span style="">  </span>And the effect of citing other social theorists is often that of an appeal to authority, especially when he refers to some theorist by name but without providing a precise citation.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Problems of evidence and clarity also mar his discussion in chapter three of culture, race, and ethnicity.<span style="">  </span>His definition of ethnicity, which stipulates that it must be relevant to some sort of problematic social situation, would leave many Americans with no ethnicity at all, including the author, who identifies himself as Scottish-American.<span style="">  </span>When arguing that being familiar with and able to operate within a culture is different from sharing a cultural identity, he cites as his example the Japanese, an insular people in more than one sense of the term.<span style="">  </span>Even many Europeans, not to speak of Americans or Canadians, are more willing to accept someone into their culture.<span style="">  </span>Astonishingly, he asserts that it is because the Native Americans were hunter-gatherers that they were incompatible with agricultural Europeans, apparently ignoring the traditional stories about Native Americans teaching the early English settlers how to plant corn.<span style="">  </span>Another startling claim is that in feudal times, "life and political authority remained local while language and hence folk culture held over a region" (69).<span style="">  </span>Cahoone appears to be reading the present into the past, assuming a regional uniformity of language that dates only from the time of Gutenberg and Luther.<span style="">  </span>Even today, there are neighboring villages in rural China that are linguistically distinct.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Curiously, it is the weakest chapters of the book that the author draws on in the conclusion, where he turns once again to stage theories and sweeping generalizations, rather than to his incisive arguments about the definition of culture and the problem of cultural relativism.<span style="">  </span>The main contribution of this book is his critique of the idea of culture in order to show why culture relativism is incoherent.<span style="">  </span>The discussion of Islamic revivalism is also useful and well written.<span style="">  </span>Like the discussion of cultural relativism, it is clear enough that one could assign it even to undergraduates.<span style="">  </span>Each of these two discussions could be -- and perhaps should have been - separated from the rest.</p>
