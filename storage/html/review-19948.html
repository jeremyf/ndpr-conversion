	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">This elegant volume collects fourteen  essays that take up, in a wide array of contexts, the issues of deception, self-deception, lying and  various other forms of dissimulation. It is an impressive addition to a growing  body of work on these topics. With the exception of an assemblage of previously published work by Harry Frankfurt, the essays have not been previously published.</span></strong><sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Part I is titled "The Practices of Deception and Self-Deception" and Part II is titled "Truth, Lies, and Self-Deception: The Theory and The Ethics." The editor writes that while the essays of Part I take up the "how" of deception and self-deception and the ways in which these are "actually carried out in human life" (5), the essays of Part II "tend to be more concerned with the theoretical philosophical debates in the  literature on deception and self-deception" (<i>ibid</i>.). Perhaps almost inevitably  -- especially given the subject matter -- this distinction is not always so  clear. <o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">More  helpful, I think, is the editor's noting that he was motivated to collect such work by virtue of his conviction that the investigations of  lying and other-deception in general on the one hand, and of self-deception on  the other, have been, more or less, pursued independently of each other and  that "both could benefit from a sustained examination of the many traits they  have in common, of the ways they work together, of similarities and  differences in their structure, their practice, their ethics" (4). As Martin puts the point when discussing Alfred <span class="SpellE">Mele's</span>  contribution to the volume, "although [<span class="SpellE">Mele</span>] thinks the  analogy of self-deception with deception is an unhelpful <span class="GramE">one</span>, I think his essay shows us just the opposite: His understanding of self-deception can provide us with a more helpful analogy with  deception" (p. 11).</span></strong><sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[2]</span></span></span></a></sup><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> I take it that, if this is so, it is because on <span class="SpellE">Mele's</span> influential  deflationary account of the phenomenon, self-deception typically involves neither an intention to deceive (oneself) nor simultaneous belief in p and not-p. Self-deception is, rather, a matter of motivationally biased  belief-formation. If, as Martin suggests, this analogy offers a better understanding of interpersonal deception, then presumably interpersonal deception is less  (or less frequently than we are apt to suppose) a matter of my intentionally bringing it about that you believe that p, while myself smugly believing  that not-p, than it is a matter of my being moved by motivational and  affective states to distort and mislead in ways that answer to my (and, very  often, our mutual) interests. It's rare for collections such as this to have so  clearly articulated an editorial aim; it is also, of course, most welcome.<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">The  first essay of the volume, the late Robert Solomon's "Self, Deception, and Self-Deception in Philosophy," succeeds as an  introduction to these themes. Solomon seeks to emphasize the varied ways in which  deception and self-deception work together as a "dynamic social" phenomenon (24). Here, Solomon works to show that we go wrong if we think of self-deception as an internal and solitary version of interpersonal  deception, and even more so if we think of the deception of others as chiefly a  matter of carrying out "malicious" and "fully intentional" lying (<i>ibid</i>.). Rather, what "we are after," he insists,<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">is</span></strong></span><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> a . . . drama of truth and falsehood in the complex social and emotional webs we weave, compared to  which what is often singled out as 'the lie' tends to become an ethical  exception of comparatively little interest (<i style="">ibid</i>.).<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Solomon  notes that we are too keen to value the truth and too ready to condemn the propagation of untruth. "Deception is sometimes not a vice," he writes, "but a social virtue" (22). There is much along the way, and not surprisingly, that is reminiscent of <span class="SpellE">Goffman's</span>  <i>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</i>. (For example, "As often as  not, deception and self-deception combine to form the most sincere belief  among coconspirators, not victim and villain" [27].) It seems to me that while  <span class="GramE">there's</span> much to be appreciated here, much  might have been made of the distinction between <i>acceptance</i> as opposed to <i>belief</i> in covering this ground. When Solomon writes that our "ideas about our selves and our place in the world are not truths but experiments" (36)  and when he writes of "commitment" (31) this would appear to be usefully regarded as acceptance rather than belief.</span></strong><sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[3]</span></span></span></a></sup><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> In this regard it's worth noting that, early in the essay, Solomon <span class="GramE">writes that</span> "philosophers generally deceive themselves and try to deceive others  about the superiority of this school or that method" (18). Here, especially,  the notion of acceptance seems helpful, since it isn't at all apparent that philosophers, generally, <i>believe</i> the positions they defend  (against all comers). Moreover, while we can certainly agree that high-minded  moralizing can (no doubt, <i>via</i> a form of self-deception) seduce us into an  overvaluing of truth and truthfulness, surely it's possible to err in the contrary direction.</span></strong><sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[4]</span></span></span></a></sup><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">It's  bracing, then, that selections from Frankfurt's work follow Solomon's essay. This will be familiar terrain for many. Even so,  Frankfurt's emphasis on the liar as seeking to impose his will upon us by putting us  into a world of his fancy, and foreclosing a presumed "form of human intimacy" (42), serves as an antidote to a too ready acquiescence to the liar's aims. And, of course, in these selections we have Frankfurt's  notable account of bullshit and the <span class="SpellE">bullshitter</span>.  When the <span class="SpellE">bullshitter</span> utters "p", it needn't  be the case that not-p nor need the <span class="SpellE">bullshitter</span> believe  that not-p. The <span class="SpellE">bullshitter</span>, thus, neither  necessarily misrepresents the world nor her beliefs; rather, she misrepresents what  she is up to -- the motive "guiding and controlling [her speech] is unconcerned with how the things about which she speaks truly are" (46). In this way, then, while the liar remains hostage to the truth as a standard, the <span class="SpellE">bullshitter</span> is blithely unconcerned with truth  and falsity. This is why, for Frankfurt, "bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth  than lies are" (48).<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">While  these first two contributions serve to deliver very different accounts of the nature and status of deceived and deceiver, the  remaining contributions of Part I serve to underscore the surprisingly varied  domains in which the issues of deception and self-deception are engaged. William  Ian Miller's "Deceit in War and Trade," is a rich source of many examples of deceit throughout history and a provocative reflection on the ways  and whys of our frequent admiration of the deceiver or trickster. This is, in  part, because the deceiver makes the fool pay for his "greed" and "vanity" (56). In this way, the successful deceiver often exploits our tendency to be self-deceived. The essay, as well, offers much by way  of a nuanced account of the role of deceit in competitive settings (war,  love, sport, commerce), and, so, makes for a useful run-up to the reader's  encounter, later in the volume, with Alan <span class="SpellE">Strudler's</span>  defense of morally acceptable self-defensive deception.<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mark  A. <span class="SpellE">Wrathall's</span> "On the 'Existential Positivity of Our Ability to Be Deceived'" takes up the matter of deception in a very different context: "the existential-phenomenological treatment of the phenomenon of perceptual deception" (68). <span class="SpellE">Wrathall's</span> investigation considers the work of  Heidegger and <span class="SpellE">Merleau-Ponty</span> on the nature and  significance of "perceptual deception" with an eye to addressing how it is that<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">It is only because we believe in a set of determinate, objective facts about the perceived world, and only because  we believe that the way the world seems to us is equally objective and  determinate -- that it makes sense to treat the success or failure of perception as a matter of truth or falsity (69-70).<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">David  Sherman's "Self-Deception, Deception and the Way of the World" begins with a worry about the current neglect of the "social component" of self-deception and goes on to develop a demanding view of <span class="SpellE">sociohistorical</span> truth and deception (drawing,  especially, on Hegel), according to which we must take care to distinguish between first-order beliefs and belief-formation and second-order beliefs and belief-formation. In "Duplicity Makes the Man or Can Animals Lie?" Kelly Oliver begins by reflecting on the role of the unconscious in the geography of deception. A bit hyperbolically, perhaps, she <span class="GramE">writes that</span> "Insofar as unconscious forces drive us beyond our control  and even beyond our knowledge, then we are all and always a bunch of liars" (104). Still, she's chiefly interested here in the appeal to various continuities and discontinuities between human beings and animals in <span class="SpellE">Lacan's</span> work and, in particular, in the alleged  ways in which our capacity for speech may make certain forms of deception a distinctively human preserve.<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Paul <span class="SpellE">Ekman's</span> "Lie Catching and <span class="SpellE">Microexpressions</span>"  is devoted to the largely evolutionary, psychological explanation of why it is that <span class="GramE">lie-catching</span> and lying are "poorly developed skills" in human beings (118). <span class="SpellE">Ekman</span> reports here as well on some of his  fascinating research concerning <span class="SpellE">microfacial</span> expressions  and on our ability, with relatively little training, to detect these  expressions of suppressed or concealed emotions. Of note, as well, is <span class="SpellE">Ekman's</span> effort to distinguish between lying and other forms of deception -- the  liar "deliberately chooses to mislead" and conceals from the deceived his intention to deceive. Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Ekman</span> denies  a traditional view that only "false statements" or other symbolic communications can be lies (119). (His example concerns <i>concealment</i>  in the matter of intentionally failing to list a past employer on a job application that requires one to respond to the query "List all past employers." Arguably, one's intentionally incomplete answer in reply to <i>that</i> query <i>is</i> a false statement. Still, one sees the point.)<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Part II of the volume begins with <span class="SpellE">Studler's</span> very fine "Deception and Trust." His point of departure is Bernard Williams' two-fold answer (in <i>Truth and Truthfulness</i><sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[5]</span></span></span></a></sup>) to the question "What is the wrong in or of deception?" <span class="SpellE">Strudler</span> notes that Williams' answer is both (1)  that the deceiver breaches a trust with the deceived and (2) that the deceiver manipulates the deceived. What, he asks, is the relationship between  these answers? <span class="SpellE">Strudler's</span> reply, too briefly, is  that while a "breach of trust is a kind of manipulation," not <span class="GramE">all manipulative</span> deception involves a breach of trust (139). One  noteworthy upshot of this is that deception <i>via</i> a breach of trust is,  generally, worse morally than deception by means of other forms of manipulation  (152). <span class="SpellE">Strudler's</span> beginnings of an account  of what is sufficient for manipulation is that "one person manipulates another when he intentionally causes that person to behave as he wishes through a chain  of events that has the desired effect only because the manipulated person  is unaware of that chain" (140).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup>  Making use of a number of striking examples, <span class="SpellE">Strudler</span>  argues that there are cases of deception in which a breach of trust and  manipulation pull apart. This will be so, <span class="SpellE">Strudler</span>  alleges, when, for example, I know you don't trust me but secure your reliance on my credibility by pointing to some "external basis [e.g., my self-interest] for my truthfulness" (143). Where such an external basis for reliance is made known, I might exploit that in order to deceive you. I manipulate  you, of course, but not by a breach of trust. As <span class="SpellE">Strudler</span> notes, this is to conceive of trust as a matter of goodwill (141), and  more than a few will dispute that goodwill is required for what is  appropriately termed "trust" to be present in communicative contexts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Of much related interest is <span class="SpellE">Strudler's</span> discussion of the  conditions in which deceptive acts may be morally acceptable by virtue of the  defensive function they serve in certain contexts. This nicely anticipates David <span class="SpellE">Sussman's</span> discussion, later in the volume, of  Kant's account of the self-defensive lie (229). <span class="SpellE">Strudler</span> develops an analogy between the use of force to defend oneself against  physical harm and the use of deception to defend oneself against a query that  threatens economic loss. The conditions that <span class="SpellE">Strudler</span>  develops are nuanced and complex; still, the discussion leaves unanswered some  questions regarding the sorts of harm that we may acceptably seek to avoid by acts  of self-defensive deception. Charles Taylor, for example, notes that a new understanding of identity has allowed us to comprehend that "misrecognition" is <span class="GramE">a harm</span>.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[7]</span></span></a></sup> Might we, in morally acceptable fashion, act deceptively in order to  avoid such <span class="GramE">a harm</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Thomas Carson's "Lying, Deception, and Related Concepts" is something of a <i>tour de force</i> of philosophical analysis. Carson's final definition of lying  is:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">L5. A  person S tells a lie to another person S1 <span class="SpellE">iff</span>: 1. S makes a false statement x to S1, 2. S believes that x is false or  probably false (or, alternatively, S doesn't believe that x is true), 3. S states  x in a context in which S thereby warrants the truth of x to S1, and 4. S does  not take herself not to be warranting the truth of what she says to S1.  (171)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">There are many noteworthy aspects and implications of the definition -- for example,  the intent to deceive is not necessary for lying on this definition  (159-61). The notion of warrant is of particular interest. To warrant the truth of a statement is to promise or <span class="GramE">guarantee</span> "either explicitly or implicitly, that what one says is true" (167). On Carson's account a speaker can warrant a statement without intending to do so and whether a statement is warranted is independent of whether the  individuals who are addressed believe that the "speaker (writer) warrants its truth to them" (169).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[8]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Carson, then, turns to the matters of deception, misleading, withholding information,  keeping others in the dark, and to a critical appreciation of Frankfurt's  account of bullshit -- and there's much here that re-pays careful study. He writes  that "deception requires some kind of intention to cause others to have false beliefs" and goes on to say that it is "self-contradictory to say that someone deceived another person unintentionally" (177). Hence, Carson notes that we should speak of "misleading" others in cases in which we unintentionally cause them to have false beliefs. I am not sure that  there is compelling reason to hold that the "deceive"/"mislead" distinction tracks the intentional/unintentional  causing-to-believe-false distinction. Certainly, we can grant that to accuse someone of "deception" is to hold them accountable and, so, <i>typically</i> to presume intentional or deliberate deceptive behavior. But even  forgetting about the fact that we speak easily of being deceived by natural phenomena,  one can certainly negligently and unintentionally deceive. This is, as I hope is  clear, a rich and rewarding essay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Michael Lynch's "Deception and the Nature of Truth," offers an inventive and arresting account of the ways in which "the conceptual linkage between deception and truth can, and should, affect how we think about the  metaphysics of truth" (197) and about the value of truth. For Lynch, it is possible  to say rather more about truth than, say, deflationists would have us  believe, if we mine the role that truth plays in our cognitive economy (200). In  order to do that, he notes, close attention must be devoted to the relation of  the concept of truth to the notions of "deception, ignorance, objectivity, value" (199). James Mahon's "The Truth about Kant on Lies" and David <span class="SpellE">Sussman's</span> "On the Supposed Duty of Truthfulness: Kant on Lying in Self-Defense" are contributions to the on-going and fertile investigation of Kant's apparently quite  uncompromising -- indeed zealot-like -<span class="GramE">-<span style="">  </span>regard</span> for the immorality of lying in his moral philosophy  and, especially, in his late "On a Supposed right to Lie from Philanthropy." Mahon develops, in very great detail, Kant's distinctions between a lie in the ethical sense, in the juristic sense, and in the  sense of right. These distinctions, along with close attention to what Kant has  to say about "white lies" and lies to oneself (207), go some distance, Mahon argues, to mitigating the alleged repugnance of Kant's claims. <span class="SpellE">Sussman's</span> essay (which is graceful and stylish  and, so, a pleasure to read) provides much by way of historical background to  Kant's essay and develops with great attention the resources Kant may (and may not)  have available in understanding a lie to the murderer at the door as self-defensive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The collection ends with two essays on self-deception: <span class="SpellE">Amelie</span> <span class="SpellE">Rorty's</span> "User-Friendly Self-Deception: A  Traveler's Manuel" and Alfred <span class="SpellE">Mele's</span> "Have I Unmasked Self-Deception or Am I Self-Deceived?" <span class="SpellE">Rorty's</span> essay returns to themes introduced by Solomon's essay, arguing that "deception and self-deception are not merely detached conclusions of invalid arguments: they are interactive processes with a complex  cognitive and affective <span class="SpellE">aetiology</span>" (247). Self-deception  is social and collusive, and there are benefits and beneficiaries of its successful practice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mele's</span></span><span style=""> essay is an impressively economical introduction to his deflationary account of self-deception and to his  appeal to contemporary psychological accounts of lay <span class="GramE">hypothesis-testing</span> in the characterization of that account. As will be familiar to many, self-deception for <span class="SpellE">Mele</span> is a matter of  motivationally biased belief acquisition or retention. His account is, then, in stark  contrast to traditionalist accounts according to which the self-deceiver intends  his own deception and, at least for a time, believes both that p and that not-p.  These untoward commitments of a traditionalist account of self-deception are  the result of modeling self-deception on prototypical cases of  other-deception. Here <span class="SpellE">Mele</span> chiefly aims to reply to a number  of recent objections to his sparse account of self-deception: (1) that  self-deception in believing that p requires appeal to a desire to believe that p is true;  (2) that a "failure of self-knowledge" is an essential element of robust self-deception; and (3) that self-deception typically involves the  possession of a false second-order belief. The essay is, I think, notable not just  by virtue of <span class="SpellE">Mele's</span> persuasive replies to the  objections but also for the way in which it puts the reader in command of an  entire, enormous literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">It's more or less typical to end such reviews with remarks such as "This is arguably the finest collection on the topic available today" or "There's no doubt that this volume will be of very great interest to anyone who works in  ethics, action theory, and moral psychology." But it's tempting, after having spent some time with this volume, to worry about and to wonder if the  writing of such things is just more collusive self-deception and deception.  After all, there are many motives at work (cognitive dissonance in various forms,  your expectations, etc.), and we all know how this review business typically  goes. Still, I do believe the remarks in quotation marks above. Seriously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <div style="">

The  account would also appear to make room for morally unobjectionable forms of  manipulation, as when for example one produces delight and thanks in a child by giving  her a surprise party.
