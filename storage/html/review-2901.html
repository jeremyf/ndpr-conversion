	<p class="MsoBodyText">Unlike his predecessors, Bacon and Descartes, Newton did not leave behind a work explicitly devoted to what we would call his philosophy of science.<span style="">  </span>Yet he had much to say about how the "experimental philosophy" should -- and almost as much about how it should not -- be carried on.<span style="">  </span>He was wrestling also with cosmic issues like the nature of space and time and the relation of the material universe to its Creator.<span style="">  </span>So passages of philosophical import are scattered everywhere in his published works as well as in his voluminous correspondence.<span style="">  </span>The challenge for an editor who wishes to convert these into a single work for the modern reader is first, one of selection, and second, one of organization.<span style="">  </span>That the task is a worthwhile one is evident:<span style="">  </span>Newton's work more than that of any other was responsible for the separation into two distinct fields of what had, until Galileo initiated the process of separation, been one.<span style="">  </span>But he himself was both philosopher and scientist, in terms of that later distinction.<span style="">  </span>And his work had an enormous influence on the philosophers of the century that followed, up to its triumphant raising-up to transcendent status in the work of Kant.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">A note on the back cover of the new volume reads:<span style="">  </span>"In this volume, Newton's principal philosophical writings are for the first time collected in a single place."<span style="">  </span>This quite surprisingly overlooks what has for a long time been a standard volume among those interested in the history and philosophy of science:<span style="">  </span>H.S. Thayer's useful volume:<span style="">  </span><i>Newton's Philosophy of Nature</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1953) in the popular Hafner Library of Classics, still available.<span style="">  </span>Inevitably, there is considerable overlap between the two volumes:<span style="">  </span>two thirds of Janiak's text repeats the selections in the Thayer work which is itself 50% larger than the Janiak version, mainly because it contains the entire text of the thirty-one Queries from the </span><i>Optics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (Janiak settles for only two) and a considerable selection from Newton's writings on the theory of light and colors, passed over by Janiak.<span style="">  </span>On the other hand, Janiak has a translation of the important early text, </span><i>De gravitatione</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, previously available only in the somewhat unsatisfactory Hall and Hall translation of 1962, here happily amended by Christian Johnson and the editor.<span style="">  </span>Janiak also includes two letters from Leibniz to Newton, a letter from Newton to Leibniz and one to Cotes, and a selection from Newton's anonymous response to Leibniz' criticisms in the </span><i>Commercium Epistolilcum</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, dealing with the charge that Newton's gravity is no more than an occult quality.<span style="">  </span>One further welcome addition in the Janiak volume is a twenty-page Introduction by the editor, rather more comprehensive than John Herman Randall's Introduction to the other volume.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Over the years since the Thayer selection of readings has been published, there has been a great deal of perceptive commentary on the issues raised by Newton's achievements in mechanics and optics and especially by his own reflections on their philosophical significance.<span style="">  </span>Notable among the most recent contributions are I. Bernard Cohen's panoramic 370-page "A guide to Newton's Principia," appended as preface to the long-awaited new translation of the <i>Principia</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by Cohen and Anne Whitman (1999); </span><i>Isaac Newton's Natural Philosophy</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, edited by Jed Buchwald and I. B. Cohen (2001), and the impressive </span><i>Cambridge Companion to Newton</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, edited by I. B. Cohen and George Smith (2002).<span style="">  </span>These three constitute a final tribute to the tireless scholarly work of the late Bernard Cohen, who over forty years did so much for Newton scholarship.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Janiak's "Introduction" recalls several of the many philosophical disputes in which Newton engaged, each helpfully illustrated by the selection of readings provided in the new volume.<span style="">  </span>Janiak tends in general to defend the propriety of Newton's own position in these disputes.<span style="">  </span>A brief comment on perhaps the most interesting of these might be in order.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">How is gravity, key to the entire achievement of the <i>Principia</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, to be understood?<span style="">  </span>Leibniz charged that it was an occult quality, occult in the sense that it purported to explain but did not explain, at least as Leibniz understood that term.<span style="">  </span>To attribute a "dormitive virtue" to a particular substance (to recall Voltaire's later taunt), does not explain how the powder acts as its does.<span style="">  </span>Ought it?<span style="">  </span>It does, however, </span><i>describe</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> the action of the substance. In context, this could be very helpful information.<span style="">  </span>Leibniz allows that attributing gravity universally to matter is helpful as information; thus, to say that Earth gravitationally attracts and is attracted by the sun can be construed as saying simply that earth and sun behave in a certain way when in a particular conjunction with one another.<span style="">  </span>What Leibniz objects to is the implication that attributing gravity in this context somehow explains </span><i>how</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> these effects are brought about.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Newton's indignant response (articulated in some detail in Cotes' Preface to the second edition of the <i>Principia</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) is that gravity is a </span><i>cause</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of motion, though the cause of gravity itself he does not presume to know.<span style="">  </span>Analyzing this notion of gravity as a cause years later, Berkeley argued that this was to reduce attribution of cause (rightly, in his view) to no more than invariable succession, since nothing is said about how the motion is actually brought about.<span style="">  </span>From this to Hume and his influential analysis of causality with its skeptical implications was only a short step.<span style="">  </span>But Newton would have disagreed with this way of interpreting his language.<span style="">  </span>He had no wish to deny or to diminish the role of gravity as active agency.<span style="">  </span>He had discovered, to his own satisfaction and to that of his followers, a complex form of agency that linked pendulum to moon, to planet, to comet.<span style="">  </span>Admittedly, the manner in which it operated was mysterious.<span style="">  </span>But he had been able to weave a tight mathematical web that made the action of gravity entirely predictable, both as the power to attract and the capacity to be attracted, the same measure applying to each.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Leibniz still had one further cogent objection to raise. When Newton spoke, as he often did, of the sun attracting or being attracted by a planet, the only sort of agency left open (it seemed) was that of action at a distance.<span style="">  </span>And this was, by general agreement among philosophers from Aristotle's time onwards, simply inadmissible, as Newton himself indeed felt forced to concede.<span style="">  </span>So the appeal to attraction was worse than mysterious, it could not even in principle succeed.<span style="">  </span>Leibniz himself believed that a respectable sort of mechanical agency, after the fashion of Descartes' vortices, would fill the gap.<span style="">  </span>But Newton had made his case even more vulnerable, it seemed, by showing that no sort of intervening medium possessing mechanical properties could be allowed:<span style="">  </span>it would destabilize the planetary motions.<span style="">  </span>And, as Cotes persuasively argued, the appeal to vortex action could not possibly explain the complexity of planetary and cometary motions, even apart from the earlier objection.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The only possibility left was some kind of non-mechanical agency, taking the term 'mechanical' in the contact-action sense demanded by the "mechanical" philosophy of the day.<span style="">  </span>Newton never gave up hope that he might be able to hit upon such an agency and tried out "active principles" (perhaps inspired by his alchemical readings) and even a highly attenuated form of a traditional mechanical ether.<span style="">  </span>Nothing came of these efforts,x but they do make it clear that Newton was not willing to abandon the new mechanics to the minimalism of Hume and those who later embraced Hume's lead.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Newton had, in effect, pioneered a new form of explanation, dynamic explanation, with the notion of force as its anchor.<span style="">  </span>And the introduction of the notion of the field more than a century later showed that his hope of finding a non-mechanical form of agency that would bridge the gap between attractor and attracted had not been vain after all. </p>
