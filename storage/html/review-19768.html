	 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In this work, McNeill pursues  two of Nietzsche's psychological questions about Socrates:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">1.  "Is Socratic dialectic an expression of a thwarted desire for political  mastery?" (5)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">2.  Is the life of Socratic examination humanly sustainable?</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">After an introduction framing  the issues, the next five chapters of the book interpret passages from  individual dialogues: three chapters on <i style="">Republic</i> 1 and one each on the <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Gorgias</i></span> and <i style="">Protagoras</i>. The last four chapters interpret Plato's views on <span class="SpellE">eros</span>,  madness, poetry, psychology, and ontology.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Some, perhaps most, of the  arguments in Plato are open to obvious objections. Readers who take the objections to  be successful have two interpretive options. One is to suppose Plato could  not reason well. The second option is to suppose that his character Socrates  did not intend such bad arguments seriously.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">McNeill falls into the latter  group. His Socrates knowingly draws fallacious conclusions, but does not seriously  intend to argue for those conclusions. McNeill believes he is able to discern,  from his scrutiny of the ways the arguments go wrong, unstated conclusions  that Socrates wants us to accept, instead of the explicit conclusions in the  text.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">One result of the book is  that there is a non-intellectualist Socratic moral psychology throughout "Socrates' philosophic practice" (2). This result is of course contrary to  Socrates' explicit conclusions in the dialogues. To be sure, in some passages,  such as <i style="">Republic</i> IV, Socrates explicitly argues against intellectualism: <span class="SpellE"><i style="">dikaiosunē</i></span> (righteousness or justice) is a harmony of the rational, spirited, and appetitive parts of the soul, where each of the three parts "does its  own work in ruling and being ruled" (443b1-2). But in <i style="">Republic</i>  I, for example, Socrates explicitly argues for intellectualism: the general human excellence of <span class="SpellE"><i style="">dikaiosunē</i></span> is wisdom (<span class="SpellE"><i style="">sophia</i></span>, 350d4-5). McNeill's method enables him to deny that explicit conclusions in the  text -- at least, those that McNeill deems objectionable -- provide evidence even  for the views of the proponent of the argument, Socrates, much less for the  author Plato.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">McNeill's method throughout  the book is to raise an objection to an argument, and then take the objection to  point to an unstated conclusion that Socrates intends to demonstrate, rather than  the explicitly elicited conclusion. Here are a few examples.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">1.  In book 1 of the <i style="">Republic</i> Socrates elicits from <span class="SpellE">Polemarchus</span>  the explicit conclusion that "the art of justice is as much an art of stealing as it is an art of guarding  against theft" (69). By looking at the argument McNeill proposes to show that "the individual claims that Socrates and <span class="SpellE">Polemarchus</span>  agree upon are highly questionable, and even under the most charitable of interpretations the inferences are invalid" (69). McNeill then proposes  an unstated conclusion<span class="GramE">, that Socrates "is trying to  demonstrate . . . the problem of the relation between dispositions to act and the  ends of actions"</span> (71).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">2.  "It has been common for readers of Plato from Nietzsche onward to consider  [Socrates' explicit statement at <i style="">Republic </i>604d1-2 that a 'man's deliberation must direct him toward the end of "correcting and restoring what has fallen and is ill"'] . . . an aspect of <i style="">Socrates' self-representation </i>in the <i style="">Republic.</i>  <span class="GramE">However, [McNeill has] every reason to question this assumption . . . as  representing Socrates' views" (231).</span></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">3.  According to McNeill, the argument at <i style="">Republic</i> 374e-376c, that dogs have something in common with philosophers, "is clearly a joke . . . [that] should motivate us to . . . question the  various moves and identifications Socrates has made" in the entire discussion of the guardians (256).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">4.  Bernard Williams has criticized Plato's <i style="">Republic</i> for its moral psychology of a detached, intellectual moral self. While  McNeill agrees that "<span class="SpellE">Williams's</span> critique of the  overly abstract picture of moral agency . . . is very much on target," McNeill  "will suggest that it is part of Plato's intention that we confront these  paradoxes" (281-2). The objection "points out the very problems . . . that [McNeill believes] Plato intends us to see" (289).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">I myself sometimes argue for  unstated conclusions in Plato's texts, and that ought to motivate me to stand  shoulder to shoulder with McNeill. Yet there seem to me a number of defects in  his method.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Consider McNeill's  interpretation of <i style="">Republic</i> 9 as an illustration. In that passage Socrates elicits from <span class="SpellE">Glaucon</span> the  explicit conclusion that people in whom the rational part of the soul rules have  the "most pleasant life" (583a2-3). Considering Socrates' argument for the  explicit conclusion, McNeill objects to the argument's move from subjective  experiences to objective conclusions about good living. McNeill then judges that  "these very problems point to" Socrates' intended, albeit unstated, conclusion, namely, that "the way in which the attempt to self-consciously justify a certain way of life to others can alter the experience of that very way  of life" (42).<span style="">  </span>Here there are a number of problems.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">1. Hit or <span class="GramE">miss</span> application.</span></i><span lang="EN-AU"> <i style="">Republic </i>9 contains three arguments for the conclusion that rationally ruled souls have the most pleasant life (571a-580d, 580d-583b, and 583b-588b). McNeill tries to show only that  the second argument is invalid. Without showing that the other two arguments  are also invalid, there can be no confidence in his conclusion. This seeming  defect is not limited to the trio of arguments in <i style="">Republic</i> 9. There are many complementary arguments for similar conclusions  throughout Plato's writings. In general, it seems to me that McNeill would need to  show the invalidity of all arguments for similar conclusions. But he does not  do so.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">2. Negligence. </span></i><span lang="EN-AU">McNeill raises an intelligent  objection about Socrates' move from subjective <span class="GramE">considerations</span>  to objective conclusions. But McNeill ignores the possibility that there  are replies to his objection. One way to try to anticipate replies is to  study published objections and replies. For instance, both Julia <span class="SpellE">Annas</span> (<i style="">An Introduction to Plato's </i>Republic [Oxford: Clarendon: 1981] 307-310) and C. D. C. Reeve (<i style="">Philosopher-Kings</i>  [Princeton: Princeton U. P., 1988] 145-6) have raised objections that are similar to McNeill's objection -- and both  have given intelligent replies to the objection. That McNeill fails to  anticipate and indeed ignores published replies to objections he raises seems  negligent to me.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">3. Over-confidence. </span></i><span lang="EN-AU">While Reeve confidently  judges that the subjectivity objection fails, <span class="SpellE">Annas</span>  more modestly judges that the argument is "more defensible than is commonly allowed" (<i style="">ibid. </i>307). It is possible that Reeve and <span class="SpellE">Annas</span> are wrong in  their <span class="SpellE">defenses</span> of the argument. But  McNeill's method requires not merely that the argument's defenders be wrong, but that they are so  obviously wrong that Plato's readers will <i style="">get the joke</i>, as it were, in any effort to try to defend such a silly  argument. It seems to me that such a requirement reveals that McNeill is  over-confident about his ability to show <span class="SpellE">Glaucon's</span> foolishness in assenting to Socrates' conclusion.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">4. Lack of charity.</span></i><span lang="EN-AU"> It is a feature of  McNeill's method that it must judge Socrates' interlocutors as foolish, since they  lack the discernment of the others in Socrates' audience or Plato's  readership, others who are able readily to see that Socrates is not seriously  arguing for his explicit conclusion. Indeed McNeill goes farther in putting a  negative construction upon <span class="SpellE">Glaucon</span>, whom he diagnoses as a  narcissist (296-7) and "sadistic" (291). It seems to me that, other things being equal, we should prefer an interpretation according to which the  conversations in the dialogues are reflections of the highest possible philosophical intelligence on the part of the characters, and that, other things being  equal, we should rule out first those interpretations according to which the conversations need to be explained as the product of psychological  disorders.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">5. <span class="SpellE">Eisegesis</span>.</span></i><span lang="EN-AU">  Like McNeill, <span class="SpellE">Annas</span> finds fault with  Socrates' argument. But she finds fault on the basis of a different objection than McNeill. The objection <span class="SpellE">Annas</span> raises stems from "a tension in Plato's  notion of the philosopher" (<i style="">ibid.</i> 310) -- a tension between, on the one hand, an <i style="">academic lover of learning</i> and on the other a <i style="">ruler of experience and practical wisdom</i>. Notice that it is a feature of  McNeill's method that it would have <span class="SpellE">Annas</span> propose, on  the basis of her objection, not only that Socrates did not seriously intend to  draw his explicit conclusion, but also that <span class="SpellE">Annas's</span>  objection points to Socrates' truly intended, albeit unstated, conclusion, namely,  that <i style="">there is a tension between an academic and a practical life</i>. Indeed, for every objection we raise to the  argument, McNeill's method will ascribe a distinct implicit conclusion to the  text. The defect of the method is that it ascribes an intended implicit conclusion  to the text on the basis of whatever objection occurs to whatever reader,  coming to the text with background assumptions different from the author's. Thus  McNeill's method seems to be unrestrained <span class="SpellE">eisegesis</span>  rather than proper interpretation. Those who use McNeill's method "make Plato responsible for their own thoughts and fancies, never dreamed of by the  writer" (to paraphrase Philip <span class="SpellE">Schaff</span> on "allegorical  and typological" interpreters of the Bible, <i style="">Through Bible Lands </i>[New  York: American Tract Society, 1878] 53).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">6. Self-refuting. </span></i><span lang="EN-AU">According to McNeill's  method, an invalid argument in the text, as shown by an objection, justifies us in interpreting Socrates as <i style="">not</i> seriously arguing for his explicit conclusion. This method seems to be self-refuting in two ways. If invalidity rules out the <i style="">explicit</i>  conclusion as the correct interpretation of the text, then invalidity is a much stronger argument to rule out <i style="">unstated</i>  conclusions -- and McNeill does not provide valid arguments to establish what he takes to be Socrates' unstated  conclusions. So the method, if it does establish McNeill's reading of the text, also  seems to rule out McNeill's reading of the text. In addition, since McNeill does  not give valid arguments for <i style="">McNeill's</i> explicit conclusions (they are, e.g., "gestures," 42, or "suggestions," 71), McNeill's method would have us deny that <i style="">McNeill</i>  seriously intends his explicit conclusions.</span></p>  <span lang="EN-AU">These seeming defects keep me  from accepting the book's method and conclusions.</span>
