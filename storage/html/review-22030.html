	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Karlsson's book redefines the significance and  purpose of psychoanalysis from a phenomenological perspective that conceives of psychoanalysis as a science (searching for truth) and "not merely as a method of treatment." His purpose is "to discuss the domain and conditions of psychoanalysis theoretically rather than from the  perspective of clinical experience." This project is clearly executed with helpful chapter summaries along the way. Overall, it casts a powerful  phenomenological searchlight upon the couch, levering the intelligibility of  psychoanalytic theory off from dependence on its own empirical moment, the practice. We  will consider the major fruits of this endeavor before questioning its risks.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Four specific objectives can be discerned in  Karlsson's book: to ground psychoanalysis as a science phenomenologically, to  present the Freudian subject as a temporalizing subject whose original striving is  the striving for existence, to integrate narrative truth and historical  truth in psychoanalysis, and to establish the function of self-consciousness in  the analytic setting. </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The first objective is to ground psychoanalysis  as a science phenomenologically by giving it a <i style="">meaning ground</i> in the life-world. This is carried out in opposition to the "supposed development" of a neuropsychoanalysis. By returning psychoanalysis to the cultural crucible, the phenomenological approach  indeed restores the fitting basis of the emergence and development of  psychoanalysis as a discourse. At the same time, the phenomenological grounding carries  out an "objectification" of the psyche, turning psychical processes into objective ones. Following Husserl's method of achieving a "pure structure" in relation to the natural sciences, the phenomenological application renders Freud's conceptions of the unconscious as  "idealized, theoretical constructions." Idealization is achieved through abstraction from sexual experiences in the life-world. That is to say, in grounding psychoanalysis in the life-world, Freud's libido concept is taken to be a radicalization of certain characteristics of "experienced" sexuality. These are introduced in contrast to a primary level of being in the  world furnished by Heidegger. In "readiness-to-hand" -- the phenomenological-existential notion of an original, practical,  future-oriented, instrumental way of being in the world -- the objects of our tasks  (equipment) are not themselves thematized. They "present themselves first of all as possibilities to fulfill intentions and satisfy wishes" and have an internal reference to a "totality" of equipment. Heidegger's purpose was to establish a primary level of being in a "hermeneutical-existential" rather than theoretical understanding. Merleau-Ponty adds to this that understanding is rooted in  pre-reflective <i style="">body</i> experience in our concernful dealing in the world.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Karlsson then sets out four characteristics of pre-scientific or "experienced" sexuality in <i style="">contrast to</i>  the pre-reflective body experience. Sexuality is thematic (rather than non-thematized), intrinsic (rather than  instrumental, since pleasure is for its own sake), focused on now-time (rather than future-oriented), and gravitates toward the unbound (rather than  belonging to a totality). Freud's conceptions of the unconscious are then presented as a radicalization of these characteristics. The pleasure principle, Nirvana principle, the principle of free energy, primary process, and the id are  <i style="">idealized theoretical constructions</i>. The development of Freud's own thought supports this. His conceptions of the unconscious became "frontier concepts, which do <i style="">not</i>  refer to phenomenal, experiential entities." Above all, the libido concept goes from being a descriptive and phenomenal concept  to one that describes something unconscious, and eventually acquires "a more constructed character." This view is underlined by the fact that the aetiological significance of neuroses cannot be limited to "observations" in Freud's clinical practice. Here we witness the levering of psychoanalytic theory off from dependence on its own  practice. The resulting objectification<i style=""> </i>of the psyche is later undermined by returning these theoretical constructions  to the analytic setting.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The second objective restores the Freudian  subject as a <i style="">temporalizing</i> subject whose basic striving is the <i style="">affirmation of existence</i>. The affirmation of existence is "original" and makes the experience of existence possible. This is a particularly productive line of thought  that could play a role in connecting moments in a wide range of  psychoanalytic theory, which does appear to be the Karlsson's hope. (For example, the affirmation of <i style="">existence</i> -- which "is not necessarily about the outer world" but whose concept "also entails an experience of an inner constancy, endurance, and gestalt" -- could find connections with the Kleinian "phantasy," Winnicott's transitional object, and Kristeva's view of symbol  formation.) Beyond this, the idea of the affirmation of existence serves as a  reminder that psychoanalysis is not least a propadeutic in <i style="">learning how to  live</i>. We return to it below.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Karlsson's third objective concerns the nature  of truth claims in psychoanalysis. In the increasingly widespread "narrative" perspective the construction of a coherent story that makes up a  meaningful whole gains an epistemological significance in the analytic setting, as  befits its character as a search for meaning. However, as narrative becomes a  truth value, confusion arises over its relation to historical truth in psychoanalysis: the reconstruction of a past embedded in the present.  Karlsson avoids choosing between the "na√Øve epistemological realism" of mere reconstruction and the threat of relativism that shadows narrative  truth, and of dehistoricizing psychoanalysis by removing the analysand from the  relation to their past. He concludes that historical truth enters in with the <i style="">breaks</i> in the coherence of storytelling in free association. The force of history has the storytelling refer  back to the past. This also undermines the aforementioned objectification of the  psyche since the theoretical constructions are appropriated by the  psychoanalytic process itself. </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The fourth and final objective is to correct  inadequate attention in psychoanalysis to consciousness. This is not only a matter  of the phenomenological notion of conscious intending, for Karlsson underscores  the radical distinction of conscious and unconscious in Freud, finding that psychoanalysis can become a scientific "explanation" of ego-alien sexuality beyond phenomenological descriptions, which tellingly lack  much treatment of sexuality. The psychoanalytic attitude toward consciousness  is, for Karlsson, more a problem of disregarding a "function" of self-consciousness in the analytic setting itself, which is most  succinctly expressed as the capacity for symbolizing.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In order to draw out some major fruits of this  enterprise, we now focus on the second line of thought, which is a phenomenological application of <i style="">time</i> to Freud's idea of the "binding of energy." Since this pertains to the most enigmatic conception of the Freudian unconscious -- drive energy -- any light that phenomenology can throw on it must be welcome. Karlsson does this by  singling out a "contradiction" in two meanings of the death drive in Freud's <i style="">Beyond the Pleasure Principle</i>. The first meaning is the binding of energy itself, ascribed here to the death  drive because Freud's essay introduces the latter first in respect of clinical  and everyday phenomena of the compulsion to repeat. The binding drive is  first of all -- and ultimately, for Karlsson -- what is "beyond" the pleasure principle since the compulsion to repeat aims at a retrospective binding  of energy to allow for control over the traumatic or unpleasurable  event/stimuli. Only after this can the pleasure principle come into operation through discharge<i style=""> </i>of libido. Discharge is now the other meaning of the death drive, in line with the Nirvana principle  of reducing excitation in the mental apparatus to (the asymptotic point of)  zero. Karlsson follows Laplanche in having the death drive be the "most  untamed and uncivilized" drive in the libido, its "bottom layer," subject to primary processes. This second meaning -- discharge --  contradicts the first and is taken to be the only characteristic that actually  qualifies for the concept of death drive. Its opposite, the binding of energy is  "beyond" (in the sense of prior to) the pleasure principle. This allows for the theoretical establishment of an original <i style="">striving for existence</i>, which does away with the idea of an "original" striving toward death. What reveals this is the application of the  phenomenological notion of time.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Following Merleau-Ponty, the subject and time  are structurally identical. Each transcends or goes beyond itself in an  openness to past and future. With Husserl, the inner time consciousness or  temporalization of the subject is an ecstatic <i style="">unity</i> with the structure of a primal impression in which retention and  protention are enclosed. That is to say, the primal impression encloses both the  retaining of what has just been and the announcing of the expectation of what is  about to come. The phenomenological example is hearing a tone that endures in an auditory experience. The flow of acts of consciousness that synthesize  or harmonize with one another is itself required for the experience of<i style=""> existence</i>. For Karlsson, then, "to bind energy, to incorporate something in the mental apparatus, to  experience, can be said to presuppose this kind of temporalization." Binding energy can be understood in terms of an <i style="">original affirmation</i> of existence, which makes the experience of existence  possible.
</p><p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The thought of temporalization also reaccommodates the later dualistic  theory of the drive. Although enclosed in the primal impression, retention and protention each correlate to something absent insofar as temporalization  is a binding of the present and the absent. Specific to protention is "the entailment of a future horizon pointing to a final Absence, so a present absence bearing the possibility of a radically different Absence, death,  whose essence is termination of the subject's temporalization." Death as an ultimate absence must be understood as the "breach" of existence. Although an inscrutable existential termination whose meaning eludes understanding, death nonetheless shows itself as final Absence, "given  as Nothingness," in anxiety (Heidegger). The countermove to death, in the binding of energy, consists of "letting the subject's intending attach itself to an object, which soothes by providing the subject with an  affirmation of the experience of existence." It is the subject's way of "fighting back" Nothingness. Rounding out this application of phenomenological  time to psychoanalysis, Karlsson underlines that, psychologically speaking,  the synthesis of time can be anything from the earliest child experiences to "higher," more developed narratives. In traumatic events time is frozen and storytelling has ceased. The compulsion to repeat may  therefore be an attempt to work through and incorporate traumatic events. It is a "common claim" that incorporation of traumatic events in a narrative is an essential moment in the psychoanalytic treatment. The  phenomenological application of time to Freud's idea of binding energy has restored the  life and death drives as genuine contraries: binding of energy/synthesis of time/affirmation of existence opposes discharge of energy/<i style="">dissolution  of the synthesis of time</i>/the libido. On this view, it is sexuality that can acquire the annihilating character known from  psychotic states. As the most untamed "bottom layer" of the libido the death drive is the tendency of dissolution.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">We now come to the risks entailed in replacing psychoanalytic method, in which theory and practice are not severed,  with phenomenological method. They can be approached by elaborating further  on the notion of death drive as dissolution of the synthesis of time. Taken as  the unbinding drive in contrast to the binding of energy, rather than  teleogically in terms of the Nirvana principle, the death drive operates not in  discharge but in the withdrawal of a part of the psyche <i style="">from time</i>.  An excitation or memory-trace held apart from the primary processes is "beyond" the pleasure principle. From the perspective of lived experience, death is a <i style="">breach in temporalization</i>. This is consistent with the freezing of time and cessation of storytelling in trauma. Psychosis indicates the <i style="">incremental</i>  <i style="">removal</i> of parts of the psyche from time. This notion  of the death drive therefore corresponds to the most radical sense of Freud's thought  of the "timeless" (<i style="">Zeitlos</i>). </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">On this view, death is not inscribed within the phenomenological orientation to possibility but is, rather, the <i style="">limit</i> of phenomenological or subjective time. Nor does this simply leave us with an abstract opposition between  time and the timeless. Psychoanalysis can question how a biological  conception of death rethought in this way as the timeless -- "the time of death" -- is both psychical and existential: the "scandalon of the timeless" (Kristeva). For this, we return to a central notion of the  psychoanalytic process itself, "working through" (<i style="">Durcharbeitung</i>), not  all of which enters into consciousness.<i style=""> </i>In working  through a "gap" in consciousness -- something missing in the make-up of personal history --  can become something sensed as "shifted" in respect of an experience that enters in a peculiar way into expressible, conscious reality. Something <i style="">like </i>a memory but with a hallucinatory quality telescopes with the time of remembering and has, for the  analysand, the quality of evidence, "truth." This suggests that working through is a <i style="">crossroads</i> of time and the timeless. It also returns us to the relational and emotional context of  psychoanalysis. The presence of an "other" (the analyst) -- more specifically, the countertransference in the method of <i style="">listening</i> -- may be felt as resonance <i style="">with </i>the striving for existence. Given the transference -- onto this "object" (resonance) -- working through then makes the affirmation of existence possible. Thus in psychoanalytic method a light <i style="">emanates  from</i> the couch, even in respect of what shuts light down.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The first risk in setting that method aside,  then, is the submergence of this light under phenomenology's powerful searchlight.  Second, there may be something premature, however desirable, about the attempt  to integrate psychoanalytic concepts and, more widely, to ground<i style="">  </i>psychoanalysis as a science. Just as a certain radical and unframeable dependence on an other makes of  psychoanalysis a propadeutic in learning how to live, so it also suggests a kind of  limit of knowledge. The development of psychoanalytic knowledge even depends to  some degree upon a tolerance for inconsistencies. The "epistemological, legitimizing function" that the grounding ambition is held to fulfill is questioned by a dialectical moment -- introducing the fissure of  inconsistency -- when psychoanalytic concept formation remains tied to psychoanalytic experience. Third, the dialectical moment seems to be necessary to the  capacity of psychoanalysis to contribute to a <i style="">critical</i> standpoint when the encounter with forms of suffering leads into an  inquiry into the limits and limitations of our historical, social, and symbolic  world. The investigation, for example, into how drive energies come further  under the spell of rationalized reason and society, as analyzed by early "critical theory," might need to be continued. In sum, the theoretical achievement that comes from removing the Freudian subject from the relational and  emotional context of psychoanalytic experience may lend itself to the  dehistoricization of psychoanalysis itself. Levering the intelligibility of psychoanalysis  off from its practice may then unwittingly fall in with the unbinding  tendency: removing parts of the psyche from time . . . It would at least be  interesting to see phenomenology consider the idea of death in psychoanalysis as a  breach in subjective time.</p>
