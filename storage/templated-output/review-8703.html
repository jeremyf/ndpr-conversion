<p class="MsoBodyText">This book, O'Donnell tells us, is about two Augustines: "the one who lived and died a long time ago and the one who lives to be remade by us and is known from his works" (5).<span style="">  </span>The first of these was a jerk; the second is an illusion, artfully created by the jerk.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">'Jerk' is my word, not O'Donnell's.<span style="">  </span>He prefers 'snob' (41) and 'zealot' (41, 45).<span style="">  </span>O'Donnell's Augustine is self-dramatizing; his Christianity is "ostentatious" (90) and he "always put on a show" (119).<span style="">  </span>He is a contemptible social climber, "always on the make" (89), with a "tendency to curry favor upwards" (90).<span style="">  </span>The fact that this is not the Augustine many of us think we know is a testament, O'Donnell believes, to Augustine's remarkable power for constructing a public self, especially in the <i>Confessions</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, that "work of extraordinary artifice" (6).<span style="">  </span>"To understand Augustine's life," O'Donnell says, "we need to be cunning in evading the snares he has laid for his biographers, but still we need to respect him and his own version of the story.<span style="">  </span>If we will wring a real confession or two from him against his will, we must first listen to the story he wants to tell us" (37).<span style="">  </span>O'Donnell says he'll tell us the story without comment, but he does actually comment, and never flatteringly: Augustine's sexual temptation is "described with great circumlocution" (38); the theft of the pears "is recounted at puzzling length" (38); we have "every reason to suspect that the bishop rather overdid the accusations against his younger self" (38); "The study of philosophy obtruded and led to religious zealotry" (39); Augustine "worked himself up into a crisis" (40).<span style="">  </span>By contrast, when O'Donnell imagines how a Donatist from Hippo would have told the story, he presents the "hostile counternarrative" (52) almost without comment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">For O'Donnell, one of Augustine's greatest successes in rewriting the story of his life is that he "suppresses the importance of the Manichee phase" (44).<span style="">  </span>Augustine asks us to believe that his Manicheism was never terribly serious, but contemporaries of Augustine suspected that he never fully got Manicheism out of his system.<span style="">  </span>O'Donnell is inclined to credit such suspicions, certainly more than he is inclined to credit what Augustine tells us of himself.<span style="">  </span>O'Donnell writes:<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Manicheism was with him early and late, and was the one truly impassioned religious experience of his life.<span style="">  </span>He was the sort of person who has a great love affair when young, sees that it just won't work, breaks it off, then settles down in a far more sober and sensible marriage.<span style="">  </span>What he says and does for the rest of his life will be marked by firm allegiance and commitment to the late-blooming relationship, but the mark of the first never goes away, and some who knew him early will be unable to credit the marriage because they remember the passion. (47)<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Yet O'Donnell does allow us to consider the judgment of Augustine's old Manichee buddy Secundinus: "it seems to me, and it's quite true, that you never really were a Manichee. . . .<span style="">  </span>You were a chaste man, pure and poor, but you went over to the barbarous tribes of the Jews and you fill your teaching with their silly fables" (45-46).<span style="">  </span>We might wonder: where is the <i>evidence</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that Augustine's Manicheism was a truly impassioned religious experience, let alone "the one truly impassioned religious experience of his life"?<span style="">  </span>O'Donnell's own description of Augustine's allegiance to the Manichees doesn't make it sound impassioned at all.<span style="">  </span>What does come across is the fact that the questions that drove him to Manicheism continued to preoccupy him, even as he gave them Christian rather than Manichee answers -- especially concerning the origin of evil.<span style="">  </span>But to argue that this preoccupation "continued to mark him as one who had been in their number and been marked by them for life" (50) seems backwards, since his Manicheism -- O'Donnell seems to concede this much, at least, of Augustine's authorized self-description -- derived from his interest in the origin of evil; it was not the other way around.<span style="">  </span>We must note as well that the Manichees demanded continence from their "elect," much as Ambrosian Christians did.<span style="">  </span>Augustine committed to Christianity in a way that he never committed to Manicheism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">What would we say about Augustine if we did not have the <i>Confessions</i><span style="font-style: normal;">?<span style="">  </span>Nothing very complimentary, O'Donnell speculates.<span style="">  </span>These lines will give something of the flavor:<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Though some pages of his sermons have a discreet mystical charm, and though his <i>City of God</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is a surprisingly effective </span><i>tour de force</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> defense of a rather forced Christian view of history, the vast bulk of his endlessly and tediously polemical writings against his many enemies weighs down our impression of him beyond recall.<span style="">  </span>He is too like Jerome in his readiness to hate, and too unlike Jerome in his somber, plodding style and his superficial learning.<span style="">  </span>He has verbal facility, but he cannot bring it alive for more than brief flashes. . . .<span style="">  </span>He succeeded in destroying the morale and the organization of the native African Christian Church, the so-called Donatists, and left it a prey to the combined forces of Arians and Vandals who arrived in Africa just as he was dying.<span style="">  </span>He did his church few favors, and he had few friends. . . .<span style="">  </span>He set a style for ambitious churchmen aligned with state authority that had hitherto been seen mainly in the Greek east.<span style="">  </span>His transfer of that model to the west is perhaps the most baleful of his achievements.<span style="">  </span>(80-81)<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It seems to be O'Donnell's aim in this book to convince us that the scheming ecclesiastic and plodding writer described here is the real Augustine.<span style="">  </span>We think otherwise only because we have succumbed to "the gravitational force of that immense and powerful book" (81), the <i>Confessions</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Let us look more closely at Augustine's efforts against the Donatists, since these loom large in the description of the Augustine we would be able to see if it were not for the fraudulent <i>Confessions</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>O'Donnell's overarching argument here is that the notion of a unitary "Catholic Church" clearly distinguished from heretical groups "is something that was invented and propagated, and Augustine's own history is a part of that process" (209).<span style="">  </span>Augustine's role in the propagation of this notion was as a participant in the dispute between the Donatist party -- much the larger of the two factions, as O'Donnell frequently tells us -- and what Augustine would have us call the catholics but O'Donnell calls the Caecilianists.<span style="">  </span>O'Donnell speculates that Augustine struck "the initial blows" that weakened "the oldest and strongest-rooted Christianity in the Latin world."<span style="">  </span>We just can't know, he says, "the extent to which the disruption of traditional loyalties and hierarchies by the putsch against the Donatists, led by Augustine and his friends, weakened the cohesiveness and powers of resistance of African Christianity" (224).<span style="">  </span>Forget about the inflammatory word (the title of the chapter is "The Augustinian Putsch in Africa"): does Augustine really do anything so terribly bad in all this?<span style="">  </span>Certainly, on O'Donnell's own telling, he does nothing unprecedented, for the Donatists in their time of ascendancy had done violence, terrorized, and appealed to imperial force against the Caecilianists.<span style="">  </span>Augustine seems content to enlist the power of the state on his side, a willingness that violates our twenty-first-century liberal sensibilities but seems almost ostentatiously restrained by the standards of the time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The turning point in the dispute came in 411, when Augustine's party prevailed against the Donatists.<span style="">  </span>Surprisingly, there is very little indication in O'Donnell's narrative that Augustine was particularly active or effective in ensuring this triumph.<span style="">  </span>Instead, it seems as though the real importance of 411 was that it brought Augustine into contact with Marcellinus, the imperial official assigned the task of resolving the dispute.<span style="">  </span>Through Marcellinus, Augustine became acquainted with Rufius Antonius Agrypnius Volusianus, who gave him the idea for <i>City of God</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Even more fatefully, perhaps, Marcellinus also made Augustine aware of the influence of Pelagius.<span style="">  </span>Thus the narrative turns to "Augustine's great failure," as the title of Chapter X describes the polemic against Pelagius and Julian of Eclanum.<span style="">  </span>"The anti-Julian works," O'Donnell writes, "resolutely deter affection, fascination, or even respect, and they make wearying and dispiriting reading, even for his most kindly disposed students" -- though he is willing to admit that Julian is "scarcely more attractive" (283).<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In discussing all three of Augustine's great polemics -- against the Manichees, the Donatists, and the Pelagians -- O'Donnell flirts with the most unflattering and reductive explanations available.<span style="">  </span>The anti-Manichee polemic disguised Augustine's failure to shake off his own Manichean leanings.<span style="">  </span>The anti-Donatist polemic was born of zealotry and snobbery (41).<span style="">  </span>The anti-Pelagian polemic arose because Augustine saw (and hated) in Pelagius a version of his younger self, a rival "for the affections and attention of the well-connected Romans whose support Augustine craved so strongly throughout his career" (254; cf. 274-275). I have already raised questions about O'Donnell's reading of the anti-Manichee polemic.<span style="">  </span>I can support my doubts about his reading of the other two with materials from O'Donnell himself, although he provides them in an unexpected context.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Quoting the famous passage from the opening of the <i>Soliloquies</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> in which Augustine says he wants to know only God and the soul, O'Donnell surveys Augustine's theology by examining first his doctrine of God and then his understanding of the human person.<span style="">  </span>Augustine's God is both unsayable and silent.<span style="">  </span>He is also a Trinity-in-unity: a point that for O'Donnell arises only when we turn to Augustine's anthropology, with its "relentless" (295) insistence that human beings are created in the image of the trinitarian life.<span style="">  </span>But what really interests O'Donnell in Augustine's anthropology is the "doctrine of original sin, his most original and nearly single-handed creation" (296).<span style="">  </span>Here, without perhaps meaning to, O'Donnell offers us some insight into the motivation for Augustine's uncompromising anti-Donatist polemics.<span style="">  </span>Part of what drives Augustine to the doctrine of original sin, it seems, is his own experience of continued struggle to express the Christian faith in both word and deed: "Bodies ache and die, half-controlled sexuality defiles the spirit, and even language comes apart in one's hands as meaning disintegrates" (298).<span style="">  </span>As a result, "Christian life here and now loses, in the Augustinian view, much of its charm and certainly loses any flavor of an exclusive club for the smugly redeemed" (298) -- loses, in other words, any right to be construed as the Donatists construed it.<span style="">  </span>As for Augustine's anti-Pelagian polemic, O'Donnell acknowledges that some of its intensity derived from his fear "of an all-powerful father who punishes unjustly and heeds no plea" (300).<span style="">  </span>The Pelagians "seemed to leave the door open to a divine tyrant" (300; the argument for this claim is not altogether straightforward).<span style="">  </span>So for Augustine the doctrine of original sin is not only an indictment of the human condition; it is also intended as a vindication of the divine character.<span style="">  </span>We need not accept Augustine's doctrine or admire his polemic to see in these considerations a more promising line of inquiry than one that writes off the anti-Pelagian works as the obsessions of an embittered old grouch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">O'Donnell's book leaves it altogether mysterious how this man, whose success in this life was apparently attributable entirely to his skills as a social climber, political suck-up, and ecclesiastical bomb-thrower, could have had such enduring influence after his life, when such skills can no longer be put to use.<span style="">  </span>We cannot even attribute it to Augustine's masterly self-construction in his evasive and fraudulent <i>Confessions</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, since (as O'Donnell tells us) no one paid much attention to that work for many centuries during which Augustine was a preeminent authority.<span style="">  </span>In only one place does O'Donnell give us an indication of what anyone might have seen in Augustine's writing:<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">It requires no partisanship and not even any approval of a single word he wrote to stand nevertheless in awe of his independence of mind, his freshness of approach, and the novelty of the questions he asked.<span style="">  </span>Each time he takes up the task of writing, he approaches his subject afresh, asking good questions.<span style="">  </span>Where Augustine repeats himself, he becomes the jazz improvisationalist, repeating old themes but never in the same way.<span style="">  </span>Though many themes, expressions, and ideas recur in Augustine, few if any of his works may be dismissed out of hand as a simple rehash of something that has gone before.<span style="">  </span>Sermon after sermon and work after work does something he has not done before, asks some new question, presses some new line of argument.<span style="">  </span>He is not dependent on others for the questions that press him, though he exploits the curiosity of others with rare resourcefulness. . . .<span style="">  </span>The way in which Augustine continued to ask questions, fresh questions, and to press his inquiries well into late middle age has a moral elegance about it.<span style="">  </span>Even in the gloomy days of whaling away at Julian, a fair reading will show that the strength of mind and the freshness of approach was still there, however the atmosphere had clouded.<span style="">  </span>(309).<o:p></o:p></p>   In both tone and content, this appreciation of Augustine seems to belong to an entirely different book.<span style="">  </span>One could wish that O'Donnell had written the biography of <i>that</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> Augustine.</span><span style="font-style: normal;"></span>
