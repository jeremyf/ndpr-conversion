<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span>I expect Gregory Currie's new book, <i>Narratives  and Narrators</i>, to attain the same importance and influence in  philosophical thinking about narrative that his earlier books <i>The Nature of Fiction</i> and <i>Image and Mind</i> have had in the philosophy of fiction and  film, respectively. It is an ambitious, careful, and philosophically rich work containing a number of novel and important arguments. The book is not  driven by a single overarching thesis; it is, rather, a wide-ranging discussion of  a variety of topics associated with narrative. Currie will sometimes move  from one topic to examine a loosely related issue before returning to the  central thread. For example, several chapters end with appendices that offer evolutionary hypotheses which, if proven, would lend modest auxiliary  support to the main argument of the chapter. Although these and other asides  sometimes seem unnecessary, they are never uninteresting.  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The book begins with an account of what  narratives are and then moves to examine a series of philosophical problems about  narrators and narratives, for example: the relationship between narrators and  authors; the ubiquity of narrators thesis; the nature of point of view and how it  is conveyed; the puzzle of imaginative resistance; the nature of irony and pretence; and, perhaps most surprisingly, skepticism about the notion of character, which has heretofore mostly been discussed in connection with  virtue ethics and meta-ethics. An "analytical contents" section immediately following the traditional Table of Contents does an excellent job of  distilling the essential argumentative pieces of the book; this is an especially  helpful device for readers who may be looking to jump into the middle of the  book to see what Currie has to say about one of these particular questions.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Some of the standout sections of the book  include Currie's careful and moderate treatment of the nature of narrative, his refutation of the "ubiquity of narrators" thesis, and his subtle and compelling account of point of view. In each of these cases, Currie is  fair to his critics and cautious in his conclusions. He builds on his  conclusions in sometimes surprising ways. His theory of point of view is used as a  basis for a theory of irony, which in turn leads him to a detailed reading of  Hitchcock's <i>The Birds</i> (1963) in Chapter 9.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Rather than attempting to summarize the various  arguments in the book, I here select two of particular interest for a closer  discussion. The first is Currie's initial account of what narrative is; the second  is his somewhat inconclusive discussion of the impact of character skepticism  on a theory of narrative.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Currie sets out two necessary conditions for  something's being a narrative: it must be a corpus (a unified body of  representations), and it must be an intentional-communicative artifact (an object whose  function, which it has from its maker, is telling a story). However, not all  artifactual corpora are narratives, and no additional sufficient condition exists to  set off those that are from those that aren't. Instead, artifactual corpora  differ from one another in degree of narrativity, where narrativity is, very  roughly, the degree of particularity, causal connectedness of events, and  attention to the motives of the characters. So "narrative" may be used to refer to artifactual corpora with a great deal of narrativity (above some salient threshold), or simply those that have <i>some</i> degree of narrativity.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Currie's taking narrativity as a matter of  degree rather than kind is quite plausible; the notion of a thing's being high or low  in narrativity is much more sensible, and accords much better with our  practices, than a categorical account. Narratives are very different from one  another and the notion of narrative is highly contextual, so any categorical account  would be susceptible to a variety of serious problem cases. So Currie's  regarding narrativity as a matter of degree is an asset.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">However, Currie allows no such flexibility in  his requirement that all narratives be intentional-communicative artifacts.  Currie argues that all non-artifactual corpora -- he specifically mentions  dreams, memories, and lives -- cannot be narratives. One might construct a  narrative out of the representations in a dream, he says, but without the  intention of a maker, the dream itself lacks the potential for narrativity. Currie  argues that: "The function of a narrative is to tell a story, and a story may  be told -- rather than accidentally conveyed -- only through the process of  making which aims at communication." (6)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">While accepting Currie's claim that nothing is a narrative that does not tell a story, we might question his contention  that a corpora <i>only</i> tells a story if it was created with a communicative intention. It is true that we cannot see something as a narrative unless  it seems to us that a story is being told, not just accidentally conveyed.  But why couldn't a person, thinking of her dream, recall the dream as if it were  a story being told by someone with a communicative intention? We might  call such things "as-if" narratives; they are seen by their audiences as  expressing communicative intention, despite the lack of such intention in reality.  But it seems that <i>once viewed</i> as a vehicle for telling a story, as-if narratives take on the same features of other narratives: for example,  they can be judged as being either high or low in narrativity. Currie is right  that any corpus that is to be called a narrative must be treated as if it were  the product of an act of communication; but it is not clear that the object  must in fact have been created for the purpose of telling a story.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Consider the possibility of a corpus erroneously  thought to be the product of an intentional act of communication. Perhaps  archeologists discover a text that lists a series of events. In fact, the corpus was  created by a series of different authors, each of whom simply recorded some  event of interest to them, as a memory aid, with no attention being paid to what  had been written above. Discovering this document hundreds of years later,  it is thought to be the product of a single maker, and the events listed are connected by the readers and seen as a narrative. Plausibly this corpus <i>is</i> a narrative, despite its origins. Certainly there is no difference for  the reader who wishes to treat it as one.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Perhaps the most interesting discussion in the  book comes in the last chapter, which takes some concerns that have been much  discussed in recent moral philosophy and considers their import for a theory of  narrative. Currie notes that John Doris ("Persons, Situations, and Virtue Ethics," <i>No√ªs</i> 32 (1998): 504-30) and Gilbert Harman ("Moral Psychology Meets Social Psychology: Virtue Ethics and the Fundamental Attribution Error," <i>Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society</i> 99 (1999): 315-31) have taken some findings from social psychology and  applied them to virtue ethics. Doris and Harman argue that a considerable body  of research in social psychology suggests that personality traits like  generosity are local rather than global, situational rather than independent.  Predictions of behavior based on global moral traits do poorly; predictions based on situational facts do much better. This research, they claim, suggests a  basis for skepticism for some versions of virtue ethics, which centers on the development of stable, deep-seated character traits generating moral  behavior. Doris and Harman's arguments are deeply contested, both because of  questions about the psychological research and because it is contested whether virtue  ethics really depends on character in the ways that Doris and Harman think. The literature in response to these arguments is quite large, and it is fair  to say that character skepticism has had a significant impact on how  philosophers think about virtue ethics.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Currie notices -- and as far as I know, he is  the first to notice -- that skepticism about character of the kind supported by  Doris and Harman would be a threat not just to virtue ethics, but also to a very  common and very plausible view about narrative that he himself supports. In  Chapter 10, Currie argued that narratives are well-suited to representing an  agent's character and that character is just the kind of thing that makes  narrative engaging and popular. However, if Doris and Harman are right, then,  given the mutually supporting connections he has previously established between  character and narrative, narrative might be in trouble. Currie claims that  character skepticism calls into question "the extent to which we credit literary representations with the power to give us insights into Character"  (207). He later notes that it might be in part because of narratives, which  often represent agents' moral characters as crucial in determining their  actions, that we are so inclined to believe in the myth of character.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Currie does not resolve this question to his own satisfaction. His defense of character in narrative is that character,  as represented in narrative, may serve as an "organizing principle" for other psychologically real states of the persons in the story such as  beliefs, desires, and feelings. (215) But he is not entirely sold on this  defense, and adds that character skepticism, if accepted, "would make Character-based narratives seem to be either quaintly sentimental tracts or propaganda  in support of a dangerously mistaken morality" (216). It is this last possibility that I'd like to comment on, because it deserves a larger discussion.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">While, like Currie, I do not think that the  evidence in favor of character skepticism is strong or unambiguous enough to call it  more than a plausible hypothesis, I agree that it is a hypothesis worth  taking seriously. If we assume for the sake of argument, as Currie does, that character skepticism is correct, then a great deal of the moral  theorizing about narrative is called into question. For example, Martha Nussbaum ("'Finely Aware and Richly Responsible': Moral Attention and the Moral Task of Literature," <em><span style="line-height: 115%;">The Journal of  Philosophy</span></em> 82 (1985): 516-529) takes the detailed presentation of agents' moral characters in realistic  novels like James' <i>The Golden Bowl</i> to be the best possible guide to the  development of moral sensitivity and behavior. If character skepticism were  vindicated, then Nussbaum's view would be not only wrong, but dangerously so -- no  guide to good behavior could be found in these novels if real people bear not the slightest similarity to the persons in the novel.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">However, though Currie does not take note of  them, there seem to be some possibilities for narrative to make a positive  contribution even if character skepticism is correct. If real people lack character, narratives could make a moral contribution by casting light on this fact  in various ways. For example, a narrative might offer us agents who seem to  have stable character traits, but then strip these traits away, showing their behavior's vulnerability to circumstance. If Currie is right in  suspecting that narratives have contributed to building up the myth of character, we  could praise those exceptional narratives that tear it down. Non-realistic  narrative works may be similarly positioned to make a moral contribution by  confounding our (mistaken) expectations that character traits will predict behavior.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">It has often been noted that contemporary  philosophers have a bias towards a certain type of realistic narrative: among  novelists, philosophers love, for example, Tolstoy, James, Eliot, and Dickens. If character skepticism were proved, we would have a strong motivation to  counter this bias and to attend to the many narrative works in which character  is less important or which implicitly call into question the idea of character.  Such works, we could argue, contribute to our understanding of morality. (In  fact, even if character skepticism were debunked, an exploration of the  contribution of narratives that use character in contra-standard ways is long  overdue.)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Currie makes a contribution by noticing this  problem and laying out the issues clearly and thoughtfully. The conclusion of  Currie's book, rather than solving this problem, serves as an invitation to  further thinking about it. The book has many virtues, and the greatest of them  might be that it opens up new areas for exploration in the philosophic study of narrative.</p>
