<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Julian Young has written an accessible, thoughtful, penetrating critical introduction to Schopenhauer that elucidates and examines the main claims of his masterwork, <i>The World as Will and Representation</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">.<span style="">  </span>Young does not discuss Schopenhauer’s more popular, accessible writings</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> or his earlier dissertation<a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a>, but the depth of his discussion of the central text compensates for this.<span style="">  </span>I will begin by describing the book’s main strengths; then I will summarize some of Young’s important interpretive and critical points, and finally I will offer some modest questions about Young’s criticisms and some reflections on Schopenhauer’s significance.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The book is exceptionally clear and concise.<span style="">  </span>Young does not waste any words.<span style="">  </span>He divides each chapter into manageable sections, each of which contributes something important.<span style="">  </span>Each chapter raises serious objections and offers a useful summary of the main points.<span style="">  </span>Some philosophers might regard Schopenhauer’s system as a curiosity rather than as the work of a serious thinker--a strange fallback to Kant after Hegel’s heroic efforts to overcome Kant’s dualisms.<span style="">  </span>But Young’s book demonstrates that Schopenhauer should be taken seriously, both because of a systematic vision that integrates his insights into ethics, human nature, art, science, and asceticism and because he offers challenging arguments for his unusual vision.<span style="">  </span>Young clarifies Schopenhauer’s fundamental concerns and motivates respect for his achievements, even when he finds them flawed.<span style="">  </span>Where Young’s interpretations might be controversial, he indicates alternative readings and clearly states the rationale for his own without getting mired in tangential discussions of other secondary texts.<span style="">  </span>He concludes with a useful appreciation of Schopenhauer’s legacy.<span style="">  </span>The book’s greatest strengths, however, are its clear analysis of Schopenhauer’s arguments and its thorough examination of them.<span style="">  </span>The book offers an excellent introduction for those new to Schopenhauer and a significant challenge to his apologists.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Schopenhauer’s system integrates elements of Kant, Plato, and Eastern religious asceticism.<span style="">  </span>Very briefly, he thinks garden-variety perceptual objects are illusory appearances that mask a deeper, underlying reality (the thing-in-itself) that he seems to identify with Will.<span style="">  </span>He thinks humans can intuitively comprehend this Will via insight into their own wills.<span style="">  </span>When manifest in appearances, the Will becomes an endless, fruitless struggle for satisfaction and survival, but Schopenhauer thinks it is a single Whole (all individual wills and all phenomena are merely its instantiations).<span style="">  </span>Because the Will is purposeless striving, and is even “evil” in that it binds humans to an endless wheel of desire, he thinks salvation requires turning away from the Will entirely through asceticism.<span style="">  </span>An initial step toward transcending the Will can be taken through contemplating great art because it reveals the essences of phenomena that are masked by interested, practical life.<span style="">  </span>Similar to Platonic forms, these essences are direct embodiments of the Will, which are then further instantiated by everyday appearances.<span style="">  </span>Schopenhauer believes that individual wills are entirely determined, but holds that the source of ethical responsiveness is the realization that all wills are identical, a realization that should produce compassion for others’ suffering.<span style="">  </span>Like the contemplation and creation of art, however, ethical compassion is only a stage on the way toward complete asceticism, which permits whatever salvation is possible for human beings.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Some exemplary interpretive questions Young addresses include:<span style="">  </span>Does Schopenhauer actually solve his signature problem of articulating the thing-in-itself, and to what extent does his mature position abandon the claim that it is identical to the Will?<span style="">  </span>Does Schopenhauer’s insistence that great art must be disinterested mean that art cannot provide <i>emotional</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> insight and education?<span style="">  </span>Does Schopenhauer’s claim that character is determined mean that people cannot transform themselves--first by appreciating art, and second by withdrawing from the Will via asceticism--in order to achieve salvation?<span style="">  </span>What are the central arguments supporting Schopenhauer’s pessimistic vision of life?<span style="">  </span>I will consider Young’s contributions to these issues in turn.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Though the youthful Schopenhauer seemed to believe that the Will is the thing-in-itself and that humans can have a kind of access to it through experiencing their own acts of will (89-92), Young notes (and Schopenhauer later realized) that acts of will (whether human or primordial) are <i>temporal</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> events and that the thing-in-itself is <i>atemporal</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> (beyond time) (94).<span style="">  </span>If the Will really is identical to all individual wills, to Platonic essences, and ultimately to appearances, some way of clarifying how an atemporal unity becomes temporal and differentiated is needed.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, identifying the Will as the thing-in-itself makes the claim that unifying with the thing-in-itself via self-denial is the path to salvation <i>incoherent</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> because the Will itself is blind, irrational, absurd, and even “evil”.<span style="">  </span>Thus, there must be something more basic than the Will with which to unify to achieve salvation (98-101).<span style="">  </span>Young argues that the Will plays an <i>intermediate</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> role in Schopenhauer’s mature system:<span style="">  </span>it integrates the various forces postulated by science (e.g., gravity, magnetism, nutrition, and reproduction) and thus completes the scientific task of comprehending reality (56-60), and it accounts for the way character determines actions (thus explaining human predictability) (66-8).<span style="">  </span>Schopenhauer’s Will, however, is only an interpretation of the thing-in-itself that accounts for human experience broadly conceived; in-itself it can only be grasped via mystic insight and complete dissociation from human willing (94-8).<span style="">  </span>Human salvation thus requires abdicating the Will for something deeper than cannot be described (101-2).<span style="">  </span>Though this analysis may still not account for the way a single, atemporal thing-in-itself breaks into a plurality of temporal acts of will and a multitude of Platonic essences, it does provide an important philosophical role for the universal Will, even if the nature of the thing-in-itself remains mysterious.<span style="">  </span>This is how Young reads Schopenhauer’s crucial Chapters 17 and 18 of Volume II.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Schopenhauer privileges the aesthetic state (inhabited by artists and approximated by contemplative audiences) because it provides access to essences in a way that everyday practical consciousness cannot.<span style="">  </span>Everyday consciousness is interested, grasping only those properties that are necessary for survival.<span style="">  </span>But in aesthetic contemplation, consciousness loses itself in the object, abandons its own purposes, and discovers the essence of the object (108-13).<span style="">  </span>It thus apprehends appearances in a new way.<span style="">   </span>Great art transcends both passions and appetites, transforming its creator and audience into will-less, timeless subjects of knowledge.<span style="">  </span>Young notes that this view implies that art can neither illuminate the emotions nor embody great passions, a claim he takes to be patently mistaken (114-15).<span style="">   </span>On the basis of interpretations of Schopenhauer’s theories of the sublime and the lyric, Young concludes that Schopenhauer allows art to illuminate emotions only as long as they remain dissociated from the person.<span style="">  </span>In the experience of the sublime we simultaneously experience awesome threats and yet remain above these threats--able to contemplate them from a cosmic perspective.<span style="">  </span>Thus we undergo a split in which one side experiences strong passion (e.g., fear or humility) while the other side remains aloof and dissociated from that passion (115-20).<span style="">  </span>Similarly in the richest lyric, we experience not primarily a personal expression of feeling but a universal emotion, an emotion that transcends our individual, egoistic viewpoint (120-4).<span style="">  </span>Young concludes that, for Schopenhauer, art can explore emotions as long as it distances audiences from them and provides contemplation of them, much as representational art invites contemplation of the Platonic essences of nature.<span style="">  </span>Young’s reading at least makes Schopenhauer’s theory of art capable of illuminating emotional life.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Young notes that although Schopenhauer believes that philosophy can have no beneficial effect on a person’s character because it is fixed and immutable, he nonetheless wants to explain the common human experience of responsibility (158-60; 163-4).<span style="">  </span>Young claims that, for Schopenhauer, persons make a fundamental choice that attaches them to their character, which thereafter remains entirely determined (163).<span style="">  </span>But since that fundamental choice is uncaused, it can induce a sense of freedom that accounts for the sense of responsibility.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, this choice constitutes an organizing principle that informs all the person’s actions, explaining their predictability (162-4).<span style="">  </span>Young wonders how such a choice is possible (since it is a temporal event) within an atemporal domain (the thing-in-itself); he also argues that the mature Schopenhauer has no right to adopt this solution because he believes that this atemporal realm is strictly unknowable (164).<span style="">  </span>Young also suggests that in salvation character is not so much transformed as suppressed, and the individual does not determine whether such suppression succeeds.<span style="">  </span>Still, Young argues that this ability to consciously suppress character abandons the deterministic picture Schopenhauer defends in Book II (192-4).<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Young suggests that Schopenhauer’s pessimism consists of a descriptive claim (that all life is suffering) and an consequent evaluative claim (that life ought not to be) (206).<span style="">  </span>The main support for the <i>descriptive</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> claim is that life oscillates between the suffering that follows from the inability to satisfy incessant desires and the boredom that follows from temporary satisfactions.<span style="">  </span>Though suffering is burdensome, Young believes that Schopenhauer’s major contribution is the analysis of boredom, which typically produces dissociation, indifference, and even cruelty.<span style="">  </span>The desperate inability to will that boredom produces is nothing like the disinterestedness and openness of aesthetic contemplation.<span style="">  </span>Thus, boredom offers no release from the suffering endemic to willing.<span style="">  </span>Everyday life is merely a pendulum that swings between dissatisfaction and boredom, neither of which yield genuine happiness (209-14).<span style="">  </span>To this descriptive claim Young objects that even if striving produces only rare satisfactions, this does not mean it always produces dissatisfaction.<span style="">  </span>There is a distinctive joy in <i>progressing</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> toward a goal, even if its achievement remains distant.<span style="">  </span>The experience of challenge can be stimulating even if the goal is never fully reached (217-18).<span style="">  </span>The <i>evaluative</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> claim supporting Schopenhauer’s pessimism is also flawed because, oddly, it presupposes that only pleasure can give life any value.<span style="">  </span>In fact, many other values that are not reducible to pleasure are equally compelling--vitality, self-development, and spiritual strength (218-19).<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">As should be evident, Young maintains a tenacious and challenging critical dialogue with Schopenhauer even as he strives to provide coherent interpretations of his claims.<span style="">  </span>Here I can only summarize a few of his many interesting criticisms:<span style="">  </span>Though Schopenhauer effectively uses the empiricist criterion of meaning to challenge Hegel’s and Fichte’s theories of the Absolute, this same criterion may render his own theories of the Will and the thing-in-itself problematic.<span style="">  </span>Even Schopenhauer’s philosophical goal of clarifying ultimate reality may be unintelligible given this criterion of meaning.<span style="">  </span>So the sword he uses to impale his enemies may deal a deathblow to the meaningfulness of his own position (46-52).<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">In addition, Schopenhauer often asserts that the Will is blind and dumb, but he nonetheless evaluates it morally.<span style="">  </span>So it must have some capacity for self-direction and some goal in expressing itself in phenomena (83).<span style="">  </span>Also, human motives require some knowledge before they can issue in action; the agent must realize that the goal will satisfy the will’s demand, and in this way too human willing depends on knowledge (83-5).<span style="">  </span>It cannot be entirely blind.<span style="">  </span>Here Schopenhauer might reply that although he does evaluate the Will he need not assume purposiveness or the Will’s capacity to do otherwise to do this.<span style="">  </span>He may be “evaluating” the Will in the same way humans typically evaluate natural disasters--as something to be avoided whenever possible--without presupposing that they could have not occurred or that they exhibit purposiveness.<span style="">  </span>He need not anthropomorphize the Will to evaluate it.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Further, though great art can certainly reveal universal essences, Young argues that it can also illuminate the uniqueness of particular objects and events, a task requiring similar attentiveness and self-transcendence.<span style="">  </span>To support this Young cites the examples of Constable’s Suffolk landscapes and Japanese flower painting (149).<span style="">  </span>Beyond this, Schopenhauer believes that the transformation of the artistic object into Platonic idea and the transformation of the aesthetic subject into a will-less, contemplative, “pure” knower are simultaneous and correlative.<span style="">  </span>But grasping the perceived object as an exemplar of some universal differs from seeing the object stripped of the additions and subtractions of practical demands.<span style="">  </span>The latter attempts to achieve pure receptivity, to restore a richer experience of the object.<span style="">  </span>But the former must go further, seeing beyond what is given to an embodied form.<span style="">  </span>Both can be achieved through art, but they are not necessarily concomitant; they are better conceived as <i>independent</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> reasons for appreciating great art (145-50).<span style="">  </span>I would add another question about Schopenhauer’s much-admired theory of art, which concerns the artistic process itself.<span style="">  </span>Is the object’s essence discovered as the artwork is created?<span style="">  </span>Then some form of artistic purposiveness would seem necessary.<span style="">  </span>But if the essence is grasped prior to artistic creation, then the artwork becomes superfluous for artists; it merely allows them to communicate these essences.<span style="">  </span>And the audience must then adopt a purposive stance to divine the essence, which is not the disinterested stance Schopenhauer posits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Finally, Young argues that Schopenhauer’s ethics fails to transcend egoism because one’s care for others is only an extension of one’s care for oneself.<span style="">  </span>At the deepest level, self and others are not distinct; thus, Schopenhauer’s view provides no respect for others as such (182-4).<span style="">  </span>Schopenhauer might reply that standard conceptions of ethics presuppose the principle of individuation that he rejects.<span style="">  </span>Schopenhauer is trying to show how ethical responsiveness is possible given his metaphysics, even if he rejects the classical presuppositions of ethics.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">To Young’s core objection that Schopenhauer never succeeds in showing how the atemporal thing-in-itself becomes temporal, some interpreters might reply by emphasizing his “double-aspect” theory of the Will.<span style="">  </span>(The universal atemporal Will is one aspect while the individual temporal instantiations of the Will is its other aspect.)<span style="">  </span>Though Young acknowledges the double-aspect theory (60-1; 78-9), he notes that this does not render any more intelligible how an atemporal entity and temporal ones can be mirror-aspects of each other.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoHeader" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Elaborating several of Young’s criticisms, I would argue that Schopenhauer never did render his empiricist aspirations coherent with his metaphysical goals.<span style="">  </span>Also, I would suggest that a single fundamental choice that would bind persons to their characters is insufficient to explain the continued experience of responsibility most people feel for their specific faults or failures.<span style="">  </span>Would they even have any consciousness of such a basic choice?<span style="">  </span>I agree with Young that Schopenhauer simply failed to see the potentially stimulating effects of suffering; it can certainly be taken as a challenge to greater efforts and more intense self-development.<span style="">  </span>This is one of Nietzsche’s many departures from Schopenhauer, and it allows Nietzsche to adopt a life-affirming orientation toward life that sharply contrasts with Schopenhauer’s life-negation.<span style="">  </span>Nietzsche retained Schopenhauer’s goal of a kind of Dionysian, mystical merging with ultimate reality, but he believed that the this-worldly life-process constituted that ultimate reality.<span style="">  </span>Schopenhauer’s salvation allegedly helps individuals transcend death, but all that “survives” is the atemporal Will (or the more basic thing-in-itself); nothing of individuality survives.<span style="">  </span>Nietzsche took similar solace in the eternity of the this-worldly life-process, but at least individuals might contribute to--and even reshape--that process, and its existence is far more certain.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Schopenhauer is an extreme example of one path within philosophy--accepting a transcendent reality and construing freedom or salvation as dissociation from the perceived world and any interest in it.<span style="">  </span>A quite different path takes the perceived world to be primary, rejecting any escape to some alternate, hidden reality; it also insists that freedom requires a sense of being expressed by this-worldly actions. <span style=""> </span>Withdrawal from and indifference to the world of human affairs, from this perspective, seems like a desperate form of egoism.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, it fails to achieve the peace Schopenhauer valued because denying the will to live can only lead to endless internal conflict and strife.<span style="">  </span>Suffering and strife thus penetrate the most refined efforts to achieve salvation<a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a>.<span style="">  </span>Schopenhauer’s metaphysics seems to undermine, rather than reinforce, his aim of achieving peace.<span style="">  </span>Young’s book acknowledges the grandeur of Schopenhauer’s effort, but it also demonstrates the many ways it remains inadequate.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span
