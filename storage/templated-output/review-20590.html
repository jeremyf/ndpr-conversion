 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">            </span>Berys Gaut's excellent new book, <i>A Philosophy of Cinematic Art</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, is a force to be reckoned with in the  philosophy of cinema, a subfield of aesthetics that has recently seen a flurry of  scholarly interest and publication. Writing on cinema by philosophers dates back  at least to Hugo Munsterberg, a colleague of William James at Harvard University,  and his 1916 </span><i>The Photoplay: A Psychological Study</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Analytic aestheticians, with a few  exceptions, had until the past few decades been reluctant to take up the subject of  cinema (let alone its artistically suspect younger sibling, television), preferring  to examine the more traditional fine arts. As the 20<sup>th</sup> Century  marched on, this resistance became increasingly anachronistic. Noël Carroll,  George Wilson, and Gregory Currie began publishing books on the philosophy of  film in the later 1980s and the 1990s, and numerous other philosophers turned  their attention to cinema as well. Today several excellent books and  anthologies on the philosophy and theory of cinema are available, and the topic has  become one of the most active and exciting areas of aesthetics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Gaut's book appears as a kind of second-wave  philosophy of cinema, and threads its way between the debates of the past three  decades, carefully describing the issues of contention. Although Gaut's positions  on various issues raise serious questions (as most philosophical positions  will), its contributions are many, not least of which are the clarity,  efficiency, and energy of the writing and thinking, the intelligent and insightful  discussions of particular films when the subject warrants it, and Gaut's familiarity  with both digital cinema and video games, the latter of which he considers to  be a form of cinema -- interactive cinema. The book's central contributions,  in my opinion, are three in number: (1) it provides a clear overview of many  of the salient issues in the philosophy of cinema, together with Gaut's  forcefully argued positions on the relevant debates; (2) it contains sophisticated discussions of the implications of developments in digital cinema and  video games for cinema theory; and (3) it defends the beleaguered idea of  medium specificity in some of its forms, thus reaffirming the importance of the specific characteristics of the medium for cinema theory and criticism.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Before going any further it would be wise to  identify Gaut's particular way of discussing cinema. For Gaut, cinema is the  medium of moving images. Since moving images come in many different kinds, Gaut distinguishes between traditional celluloid-based photographic cinema,  digital cinema, animated cinema, and electronic cinema (television). The idea  that moving images lie at the heart of the medium is not a new one; other  scholars have proposed that photographic films, animations, and digital media  should be grouped under the umbrella term "moving image media," and that "moving image studies" would be a useful rubric to describe the field of academic study encompassing the study of such moving images and  associated forms of communication and art. Yet Gaut's proposal that the moving  image media be called "cinema" is novel, in that "cinema" has heretofore been associated with traditional photographic motion  pictures, the word having a 19<sup>th</sup> century feel deriving from its origins in  that ground-breaking invention of the Lumiére brothers, the <i>cinématographe.<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Since one of the goals of philosophy is to  promote conceptual clarity, one sees the value of calling the medium "cinema," and identifying kinds of cinema under this broad rubric. The terminology is stipulative, however, and its uptake in the broader  community dependent on the negotiation of several political landmines, not least  of which is the unlikelihood that video game and/or television scholars will look  kindly on conceptualizing their chosen media as forms of cinema. One envisions a television scholar archly suggesting that traditional cinema be  considered a form of television (photochemical television?), or the video game  scholar insisting that video games constitute a new medium separate altogether  from cinema. I happen to like Gaut's terminology, but not everyone will.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the book Gaut clearly details the salient  issues that philosophers and film theorists have so far grappled with. What sets  this book apart is Gaut's careful attention to how the old debates about  traditional cinema relate to new forms of cinema, and especially digital cinema and interactive cinema (video games). While these discussions make the book especially useful and quite up to date, one wonders why electronic  cinema (television) is almost completely ignored.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the first chapter Gaut turns to Roger  Scruton's argument against taking photography and cinema as art forms because as photographic media, they record what is in front of the camera  automatically and thus cannot express thought. One might question whether Scruton's  arguments need be taken seriously any longer, and indeed, Gaut does summarily  reject them. Along the way, however, Gaut provides some fascinating discussions  of Rudolph Arnheim's theory of film and on differences between analog and  digital photography. The second chapter examines whether film is a language  (Gaut claims that it is not) and discusses the nature and types of realism in  both traditional and digital cinema. Gaut here argues, contra Kendall Walton,  that photographs are not transparent, since in seeing a photograph the light  rays emanating from the object photographed do not pass directly into our  eyes. All images, both traditional and cinematic, are opaque.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the third chapter Gaut vehemently opposes the  <i>auteur</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> theory, or the theory  that one person, typically the film's director, should be considered to be the "author" of the film, and instead argues for multiple authorship in the case of most movies.  He also discusses these issues in relation to digital and interactive cinema. In "Understanding Cinema," Chapter 4, Gaut rejects intentionalism as a theory of interpretation of collaborative artforms. He also rejects film theorist David Bordwell's constructivisim in favor of what Gaut calls "detectivism." This prepares the way for his "patchwork theory" of film interpretation, which holds that several factors figure into determining the correct interpretation of a film, of which the  intentions of the makers are only one. In illustrating his patchwork theory, Gaut  provides a fascinating demonstration of the patchwork theory in practice in his  discussion of Akira Kurosawa's </span><i>Rashomon</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In Chapter 5 Gaut discusses cinema narration,  identifying and rejecting three models of implicit cinematic narrators, and arguing  that only explicit voice-over narrators ought to be acknowledged in the  cinema. Along the way Gaut provides an excellent account of major differences  between film and literature, an account that serves as evidence for his  contention that medium-specificity has a role to play in the philosophy of cinema.  Finally in this chapter, Gaut also turns to interactive narration, that is, to how  we should think of narration in interactive media such as video games.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Emotion and identification are the subject of  Chapter 6, in which Gaut explains the medium-specific ways that cinema fosters  emotional engagement, and defends the notion of "identification" from those who consider the concept to be too vague or ill-defined. Gaut finds it  curious that most cognitive and analytic theorists and philosophers have rejected the  notion of identification altogether as either confused or too broad and  ambiguous. Noël Carroll, for example, has rejected identification because it  ostensibly presumes a kind of Vulcan mind-meld between audience and character. Gaut  notes that the etymological root of "identification" is of "making identical," but claims that the meaning of a term "is a matter of its use in the language" (255), not in its etymology.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Fair enough, but one wonders if Gaut's  definition of identification succeeds in identifying the use of the word in ordinary language, or else stipulates a definition that Gaut claims to be more  precise. Gaut defines identification as "imagining oneself in a character's situation" (258), and goes on to distinguish between two broad sorts of identification, imaginative and empathic identification. Imaginative identification can itself be subdivided into various types, including perceptual, affective, motivational, epistemic, practical, and perhaps  other forms, depending on what aspect of the character's situation the  audience imagines itself to be in. Empathic identification, on the other hand,  occurs when one shares one or more of the character's (fictional) emotions  because one has projected oneself into the character's situation. One might ask why  we should take empathy to be identification at all, rather than an emotional  response to identification, if identification is defined as an act of the  imagination rather than a kind of emotional response. Further discussion would take  us too far afield, but there are other questions that could be asked of Gaut's  theory of identification.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This book can be seen in part as a challenge to  Noël Carroll's sustained critique of media specificity. Thus Gaut's  concluding chapter affirms three medium-specificity claims that Gaut holds to be  not only correct, but necessary for a proper appreciation of the cinema. He distinguishes between a medium and art form, describes how media can be  nested within each other, and says that medium <i>specificity</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> has less to do with uniqueness than it does  with what he calls differential properties. This chapter also serves as a  useful summary of the main points of the book, in which Gaut illustrates each  of his three medium-specificity claims by reminding us of the conclusions he  came to earlier in the book, and of how they illustrate specific characteristics  of the medium of moving pictures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  Berys Gaut's overall achievement in <i>A  Philosophy of Cinematic Art</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is substantial,  among other things, for his persuasive argument for medium specificity, and for his attention to new forms of cinema. This accomplished book is essential in  the library of anyone interested in the philosophy of cinema.</span>
