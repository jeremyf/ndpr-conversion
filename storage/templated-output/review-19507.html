 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">To write a compendium to the Cynics covering their history from the 4<sup>th</sup> century BCE to the 6<sup>th</sup>  century CE and their huge and diverse influence from their beginnings down the ages  to the present day is an unspeakable task. It requires competence over a vast  time span, over many different periods and cultures, over not only philosophy  but also history, politics, literature, religion (Jewish and Christian as  well as pagan), and art, and it includes major Classical writers (Horace,  Petronius, Lucian) and major European philosophers (Rousseau, Nietzsche). It also  requires considerable discrimination in the use of the ancient evidence,  extremely lacunose and varied as it is. Add the prospectus of this series, <i style="">Ancient Philosophies</i>: 'fresh and engaging introductions to the major schools of philosophy of antiquity .  . . clear and rigorous presentations of core ideas . . . for students of  philosophy and classics', to almost all of whom almost of all of this material will  be new.<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b><span class="GramE">Hence a need for a deft mixture of primary  material and context or background, of basic information and critical analysis.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Desmond, well-informed author of the well-received <i style="">The  Greek Praise of Poverty: Origins of Ancient Cynicism </i>(2006)  (<a href="http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2006/2006-08-05.html">http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2006/2006-08-05.html</a>), writes, indeed, freshly and engagingly, and his wide stylistic range  includes colloquialisms, jokes and nice <span class="GramE">turns</span>.<b style=""><i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></b></span></p><span style="line-height: 115%;"><o:p></o:p></span>  <span style="line-height: 115%;">The glossaries, bibliography, index and the wide-ranging and detailed 'guide to further reading' are excellent, the  last of value to specialists as well as beginners. The basic organization is  coherent (if problematic in some respects). The overall movement is  chronological: chapter 1 provides potted introductions to the main Cynics and others  more or less influenced by Cynicism, while chapters 2-6 treat major themes and concerns, with recurrent movements from negative to positive.</span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><o:p></o:p></span>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Shortcomings include constant documentary overload; much disproportion, repetitiveness and overlapping; some  self-contradiction; insufficient referencing and cross-referencing; a rather capricious relationship between text, notes within the text, endnotes and 'further reading'; unexplained or over-allusive allusions; some disconcerting  Latin and English solecisms, and some very old-fashioned historical perspectives  (which I do not illustrate but which will disturb historians). The book is too  long for its contents; disciplined pruning would have allowed much additional  matter. Desmond's readers should have been more stringent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">The introduction takes the Diogenes of the encounter with Alexander as representative, summarizes his thinking and behavior  as well as different ancient reactions, distinguishes between ancient Cynicism  and modern cynicism, outlines positive modern verdicts on the former,  distinguishes between different types of cynicism, and signals the main sources. The exposition is over-long (e.g. on modern cynicism [2-3]), too allusive  (the largely unexplained 'most important sources' [5-6] would baffle most  students), and careless in expression ('various dialogues of Lucian, especially the  <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Cynicus</i></span><i style=""> </i>once  (erroneously) attributed to him' [5]). The historicity of the encounter (well defended by Hammond, <i style="">Sources for Alexander the Great </i>[1993] 28) seems to be accepted (7), but without rigor. Yet the question is  important on many levels: Diogenes' attitude to worldly rulers; his practical  response to them; his frankness, bravery and culture of nature; Alexander's  knowledge of contemporary philosophers; and <span class="SpellE">Onesicritus</span>'  portrayal of Diogenes and of Diogenes' role in his portrayal of Alexander. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Desmond never faces up to these kinds of historical questions, which affect assessment alike of the substantiality, impact  and reception of Cynicism.<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b><span style=""> </span>Introductions  may perhaps legitimately flag arguable conclusions, though in the case of such a controversial topic as  Cynicism an initial <i style="">tabula rasa </i>would in my view have been the better course. At any rate, here already, unequivocally,  Cynicism is a 'philosophy', 'Diogenes . . . the first . . . "dog" '(5), Cynics were not 'mere shameless "dogs" ' (4), but 'astonishingly optimistic regarding human nature' (3), and 'Cynicism . . . was both a single  outlook and extraordinarily varied' (5) (hence the usual sub-divisions, used with  scare quotes, 'hard', 'soft', 'literary', etc.). While Desmond subsequently  produces piece-meal arguments for most of these claims, which (in my view) are  more or less correct (although I believe that, like others, he exaggerates  Cynicism's 'extraordinary variety'), he never confronts the single biggest question  about Cynicism (already in ancient tradition, explicitly at D.L. 6.103, and  still debated): whether it qualifies as a philosophy in any sense rather than  just a way of life. While the two can cohere, 'right living' being the goal of  ancient philosophy generally (Macleod, <i style="">JRS </i>69 [1979] 16-27), such 'living' requires <i style="">some</i> underlying thinking. That Cynicism had some such thinking is most easily (though not solely) demonstrable through reconstruction of important  Cynic texts, written, as they were, in <span class="SpellE">serio</span>-comic  style. Desmond, naturally familiar with such source criticism (263), never  pursues it, convincing though some of it is (though he occasionally reconstructs  chains of thought [e.g. 157]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Hence much blurring of different categories of evidence and a major structural problem for the book: the exposition of  ancient Cynicism ends with Cynic cosmopolitanism, for which the key text is  Diogenes' <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Politeia</i></span>, <span class="SpellE">reconstructible</span> from D.L. 6.72 (as Desmond seems  to concede [186]). That work, however, should come at the beginning, because it is  also <span class="GramE">key</span> for understanding all <span class="SpellE">Diogenic</span> Cynicism and of most of its developments and modifications. Failure to acknowledge such basic material produces further confusions: between the questions of the uniformity of Cynicism over the ages and of the unity  of <span class="SpellE">Diogenic</span> Cynicism (6-7; 245 n. 1); and  concerning that very unity (formally different values [245 n. 1] belong within a single  coherent 'package'). It also inhibits clarification of Cynicism's overall logic,  which combines 'thought' (necessarily, given other Cynic assumptions,  minimalist) with 'performance' or 'what works', the latter both as a verifiable  solution for oneself and as a demonstration for others. Further, especially given  the prospectus, consideration should have been given to the question of  whether Cynicism qualifies as a 'school' (answer: yes and no). Finally, the  question of vulgarization and bowdlerization of the record should have been trailed:  <span class="SpellE">Höistad</span> held that the image of the  historical Diogenes was grossly <span class="SpellE">vulgarised</span>, and, though the claim is untenable, it merits notice as that of a major Cynic scholar;  conversely, bowdlerization and idealization of the historical Cynics is a persistent  trend in the tradition (as, again, Desmond knows [75, 268] but generally  underplays).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">The very useful first chapter begins with a historical survey of Greece, Macedon and Rome, distinguishes between proto-Cynics (legendary, from other cultures, Socrates), 4<sup>th</sup> century  'canonical' figures, Hellenistic 'literary' Cynics, and the eclectic Roman period,  down to the Christian Fathers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Some comments on details in Chapter 1: <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">While Desmond rightly  stresses the schizophrenic appearance of Antisthenes' thought, 'the ancient  tradition' that 'Antisthenes was the first Cynic', though <span class="GramE">dominant</span>,  is not 'unanimous' (13). Antisthenes' obvious influence on Diogenes does  not require a 'personal link', to which the powerful objections, as Desmond  does not say, are chronological. Antisthenes' strong continuing presence  within the Cynic tradition (greater than recognized at 18, 157) is noteworthy: see <span class="SpellE">Brancacci</span> in Swain (ed.), <span class="SpellE"><i>Dio</i></span><i> Chrysostom: Politics, Letters, and Philosophy </i><span style="">(2000),  240-60<span class="GramE">;</span> </span>Moles, <i style="">JHS </i>125  (2005) 112-38 (on <span class="SpellE">Dio</span> 13).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">D.L. 6.71 shows that the  motto 'deface the currency' was adopted not just by 'later Cynics' (20) <span class="GramE">but</span> by Diogenes himself. Desmond here (20) takes  Aristotle's 'dog' (<i style="">Rhet</i>. 1411a24) as Diogenes, whereas 246 n. 10 <span class="SpellE">favours</span> Antisthenes (so M<span class="GramE">.-</span>O. <span class="SpellE">Goulet-Cazé</span>). On  the question of Diogenes' writings, Desmond begins (22): 'other <span class="SpellE">rumours</span> impute various writings to Diogenes' and concludes: 'perfect precision  about Diogenes' sayings, writings, movements and life is not attainable. What  is more important . . . is the personality of the man' (as if this could be  established independently?). On the question of Diogenes' (fictitious) enslavement:  'it may well be the case that as an exile Diogenes was enslaved at some point'  (22). Such evasions frustrate scholarly progress. As for <span class="SpellE">Hipparchia</span>, 'later denigrators sneered that [Crates and <span class="SpellE">Hipparchia</span>] had sex in public' (27). In fact, this <span class="GramE">well-attested</span> 'dog marriage' perfectly enacts <span class="SpellE">Diogenic</span>  sexology, as long ago demonstrated by <span class="SpellE">Rist</span>, <i style="">Stoic  Philosophy </i>(1969) 61 ff. (which Desmond knows [271]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Onesicritus's</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%;"> Alexander history was not formally a 'biography' (30). <span class="GramE">Desmond's discussion  of <span class="SpellE">Onesicritus</span>' account of his visit to the Gymnosophists is under-developed, nor does he register the sheer  chutzpah of <span class="SpellE">Onesicritus</span>' '<span class="SpellE">cynicisation</span>' of Alexander (on both: Moles in <span class="SpellE">Laks</span> and  Schofield, <i>Justice and Generosity </i><span style="">(1995) 144 ff.).</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Bion's</span> 'biography' is obviously partly based on Diogenes' 'biography' (<i style="">OCD</i>³, 243). The discussion of diatribe is rather generalized and could have been improved by  consultation of <i style="">OCD</i>³, 463; undoubtedly, <span class="SpellE">Bion</span> (and Zeno) wrote works with that title, and  Horace represents his <i style="">Satires </i>as belonging to the '<span class="SpellE">Bionian</span>', 'Cynic' and '<span class="SpellE">serio</span>-comic' 'genre' of 'diatribe' (<i style="">Epistles </i>2.2.60; <i style="">Satires </i>1.1.13-14).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">As Cynic, politician and <span class="GramE">law-maker</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cercidas</span>  (35) deserves fuller treatment, especially as fairly substantial fragments survive.  Desmond's discussion of <span class="SpellE">Oenomaus</span> does not register his  clear philosophical and literary imitation of Diogenes (a further consequence  of failure to engage with the question of Diogenes' writings), as  demonstrated by <span class="SpellE">Hammerstädt</span>, whom Desmond  references. Demetrius was hardly 'the first "true" Cynic after a hiatus of some two hundred years' (50)<span class="GramE">;</span> see Moles, <i style="">JHS</i> 103 (1983) 120 ff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Dio</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%;"> Chrysostom did not criticize his friend Titus 'for having a homosexual relationship  with a boxer' (57): <i style="">Orr</i>. 28 and 29 are encomiastic. Characteristically, neither here nor elsewhere, does  Desmond commit himself on -- still less, argue out -- the key question of  whether <span class="SpellE">Dio</span> spoke the <i style="">Kingships </i>to Trajan. On <span class="SpellE">Dio</span> 13, a major (partly)  Cynic text, see Moles, <i style="">JHS </i>125 (2005) 112 ff. Desmond's general emphasis on the importance of Cynicism to the  Stoic Epictetus (59), as against scholars such as Brunt and Long, seems to me  correct and important, though space should somewhere have been found for full  treatment of 3.22, another key text on Cynicism, powerfully analyzed by Schofield,  <i style="">Philosophical Quarterly </i>54 (2004) 448 ff. (unreferenced).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Desmond's extended analyses  of Lucian, here (55-6, 60-7) as elsewhere, are a major strength of the  book. Lucian's 'digging-up' of '<span class="SpellE">Bion</span>' (61; <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Bis</i></span><i style="">. Acc. </i>33)  alludes to 'philosophical and literary reincarnation' (e.g. Woodman in A.J. Woodman and D. Feeney [<span class="SpellE">eds</span>], <i style="">Traditions and Contexts in the Poetry of Horace </i>[2002], 53 ff.) and to <span class="SpellE">Bion's</span> punning both on his own name as 'life' (Moles in S. Harrison, <i style="">The Cambridge Companion to Horace </i>[2007] 178) and on the Cynic 'way of <i style="">life</i>'. Desmond (67-9) ignores Clay's disturbing (but, I think, untenable) claim  (<i style="">ANRW </i>II.36.5, 3425) that Lucian invented <span class="SpellE">Demonax</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Chapter 2 is also very useful (though too long), and considers the topic under various headings (clothing, housing, diet,  etc).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Some comments on details in Chapter 2:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">The tentative treatments of  Diogenes and cannibalism (86) and the<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b>community  of children/women/men (95, cf. also 257 n. 10) are further casualties of Desmond's abjuration  of source criticism. The 'sex' section (89) also needs Diogenes' <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Politeia</i></span>, also the source of Diogenes' 'mischievous syllogism' (103; D.L. 6.37; 72).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">The interesting discussion  of Cynic views on slavery could use Brunt, 'Aspects of the Social Thought of <span class="SpellE">Dio</span> Chrysostom and of the Stoics', <i style="">PCPS  </i>19 (1973) 1 ff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Unfashionably (but, I think, rightly), Desmond follows <span class="SpellE">Rostovtzeff</span> and  Baldwin in discerning real social protest in the <span class="SpellE">Cynicising</span> Lucian (100).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">To my mind, Desmond (101 and elsewhere) over-emphasizes Cynic 'opportunism'. The motto 'use the  things that are present' (both spatially and temporally) allows a certain (small)  moral relativism, then greatly developed by <span class="SpellE">Bion</span>  under <span class="SpellE">Aristippus</span>' influence (cf. <i style="">OCD</i>³,  243; Horace, <i style="">Epistles </i>1.17, reads this aright).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">The wide-ranging discussion  of Cynic 'language', including gesture (122 ff.), might also consider: (a) <span class="SpellE">Bosman's</span> 'Selling Cynicism: the Pragmatics of  Diogenes' Comic Performances', <i style="">CQ </i>56 (2006) 93 ff.; (b) the likely influence of Antisthenes (cf. 18, 157, 255 n. 53);  (c) the fact (<i style="">pace </i>123) that some of Diogenes' jokes play, precisely, on the 'instability of the sign',  hence, presumably, further incentive towards a philosophy of 'what works'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">In chapter 3, necessary background (different conceptions of nature; other philosophers' interpretation of the motto; anticipations of Cynic thinking) becomes foreground and for far too  long, though useful points emerge (e.g. similarities with the Epicurean 'life according to nature' [147]), as, eventually, does the right conclusion:  Cynics interpreted the motto <span class="SpellE">primitivistically</span>  (160-1; 257 n. 10). Fifty years ago, simple <span class="SpellE"><i style="">quellenkritik</i></span><i style=""> </i>(Brown, <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Onesicritus</i></span> [1949] 149 n. 152) proved Diogenes' imprimatur here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">The same criticism applies to chapter 4, although, again, there are interesting things. Following <span class="SpellE">Relihan</span>, Desmond interprets Petronius' <span class="SpellE">Menippean</span> <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Satyricon</i></span> as a Cynic novel, whose <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Cena</i></span><i style=""> </i>dramatizes reversals of Fortune, from which the Cynic-like wanderers <span class="SpellE">Ascyltus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Encolpius</span> escape (169-71). This interesting and  coherent interpretation (again) harnesses Cynicism to serious social criticism,  although <span class="SpellE">Petronian</span> scholars seem unimpressed. The  comparison of the self to an actor is first attributed not to <span class="SpellE">Bion</span> (181) but to <span class="SpellE">Aristippus</span> (D.L. 2.66, cf.  Horace, <i style="">Epistles</i> 1.1.19; 17.23-4). Its great importance to the Stoic <span class="SpellE">Panaetius</span> (<span class="SpellE">Cic</span>. <i style="">Off</i>. 1.107 ff.) <span class="GramE">should</span> be signaled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Chapter 6 finally tackles Diogenes' <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Politeia</i></span>, which (<i style="">pace </i>186) is  perfectly compatible with Crates' <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Pera</i></span>. <span class="SpellE">Cercidas</span> should have appeared here. Desmond  makes interesting observations about the Cynics' 'democratic populism'  (188-92). On the other hand, philosophical kingship theory is not <span class="SpellE">unproblematically</span> Cynic (196), as Desmond later admits (199)<span class="GramE">;</span>  see also on <span class="SpellE">Onesicritus</span> above. For the rest,  Desmond's discussion of Cynic cosmopolitanism, giving it great positive value,  largely follows positions I myself have maintained. One false note is the claim  that Epicureans were not missionary philosophers (203).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Chapter 6 is inevitably a highly selective gallop, with individual stops, from Stoicism to <span class="SpellE">Sloterdijk</span>, and, finally, <span class="SpellE">Navia</span>, both of whom argue for  the value, even the necessity, of Cynic thinking in today's world, thereby  ending the book on an uplifting note. Many of the gaps are plugged in the  'further reading'; see also now L. Shea, <i style="">The Cynic Enlightenment: Diogenes in the Salon </i>(2010).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Some comments on d</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">etail</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%;">s in Chapter 6:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Desmond rightly stresses  that later Stoics generally retreated from <span class="SpellE">Chrysippean</span> intellectualism to an ethical core exemplified by an <span class="SpellE">idealised</span> Cynicism (211), though he omits <span class="SpellE">Panaetian</span>  hostility and Seneca's interesting ambivalences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Although 246 references <span class="SpellE">Gigante's</span> <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Cinismo</i></span><i style=""> e <span class="SpellE">Epicureismo</span></i>, I would have  liked consideration of the superficially more surprising Cynic influence on the Epicureans, which  seems to me considerable, despite the fact that Epicureans, from Epicurus on,  reviled the Cynics, presumably on the principle of 'that man did me a good turn  ten years ago and I've hated him ever since'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">The pages on claimed  relationships between Cynicism and early Christianity should have 'main-texted' diatribe and  Cynic influence on Paul (convincingly expounded by Malherbe, referenced on  272).<b style=""> </b>The discussion of the 'Cynic Jesus' controversy balances arguments conscientiously, before tilting to the  negative. Like most such discussions, however, it envisages only two  possibilities: Jesus the complete Cynic or a Jesus wholly untouched by Cynicism, whereas the  case for <i style="">some </i>influence has, I believe, <i style="">some </i>good  arguments. The long discussion of later Christians' ambivalence to Cynics culminates with <span class="SpellE">Leontius</span>' <i style="">Life of <span class="SpellE">Symeon</span> </i>(7<sup>th</sup> century), where Desmond is unduly noncommittal about Krueger's claim of a systematic analogy with an unreconstructed Diogenes: remarkable final  proof of the longevity and canonicity of <span class="SpellE">Diogenic</span>  Cynicism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Criticisms allowed for, this book remains a considerable achievement. It unites rare diligence with unobtrusive intelligence and independence of judgment. Its coverage is immense.  Anyone who works on Cynicism at any level will find it extremely useful.</span></p><p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span>   See also Scott Rubarth's review at http://<a href="http://www.bmcreview.org/2009/08/20090836.html">www.bmcreview.org/2009/08/20090836.html</a>.
