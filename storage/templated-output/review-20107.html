 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Eugene Holland, Daniel  Smith, and Charles Stivale, three leading Deleuze scholars, have collaborated to produce a much needed and excellent book that focuses on Deleuze's work on art, film, image, text  and literature as well as philosophy.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup>  The book is comprised of thirteen essays and includes an introduction by Holland.  This collection stems from a conference originally held at the University of  South Carolina from April 5-8, 2007, sponsored by the Program in Comparative Literature, the English Department and College of Arts and Sciences, and organized by Professor Paul Allen Miller. Featured in the text are  essays by major Deleuze and Guattari scholars, including Constantin Boundas,  Elizabeth Grosz, and Éric Alliez. Holland notes, </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Deleuze was  intensely interested in the medium of thought -- interested in both individual styles of  thought and in the various genres in which thought is conducted. For thought is by  no means limited to philosophy alone: it also takes place -- can also take place,  in the right hands and under the right circumstances -- in science,  mathematics, literature, painting and cinema, to mention some of the genres or media  of thought to which Deleuze most often refers. (1) </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Faithful to Deleuze's vision, the editors bring  together scholars and artists to think about and extend Deleuze and Guattari's  specific philosophical legacy concerning the arts and philosophy. But this  collection is more than expository, as the editors have arranged the essays so that  they assist readers in seeing how key concepts in Deleuze can actualize  themselves through different frameworks. Holland comments, </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">In this volume, we  have grouped essays according to genre categories -- literature, art, philosophy --  but as we and the contributors understand Deleuze's work, these categories  intersect in an ongoing circulation of conceptual exchange. . . . We wish to  introduce this volume by highlighting some of the transverse connections linking  the essays via issues of representation, temporality, affect, sensation and counter-actualization. (2)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Part I, "Text and Literature," opens with an essay by Ronald Bogue titled "The Landscape of Sensation." Here, the author asks, "What is the relationship between texts and images in Deleuze's conception of the arts?" (9) Bogue's response consists of a conceptual (also a "physical, literal") model where he grafts various arts onto Deleuzian concepts. He remarks: </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">We may thus  construct the final composite model: (1) landscape, melodic landscape, respiration-space and skeleton-space, universe, cosmos, monochromatic field,  deterritorialization; (2) House, structure, territory and (3) face, rhythmic characters,  non-human becomings, figure. How might the various arts be situated in regard to  this model? (19)<b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Unlike more traditional thinkers -- one is  reminded here of Lessing's classifications of the arts -- Deleuze and Guattari see  various arts as drawing from all three concepts, but arts do not neatly identify  with one or more of these categories. In the Deleuzian conception, the arts  are always trying to overcome themselves, that is, they transcend both their techniques and traditional fields of representation. As such, they are  always undoing themselves as they produce intense relations. Bogue successfully captures the schizophrenic nature of the arts and he examines the work  of Beckett, Messiaen and others in order to show how one is to conceive  concretely Deleuze's view of the arts. Sometimes, it is hard to follow Bogue's use  of Deleuzian categories to qualify certain works of art, but this could be a result of the complexity and novelty of Deleuze's ideas. One wonders,  however, whether the Deleuzian view of the arts, with its emphasis on fluidity,  becoming and degeneration, at least as Bogue presents it, can name, to employ a  term from Badiou, any real, enduring concrete poetic or artistic event that  radically changes and organizes the way we do art. In other words, apart from classifications and the blurring of borders, how do we explain true  artistic interventions or events that have an enduring sense for generations that follow? One could argue, following Bogue, that Beckett, Pessoa, and  Shakespeare are forms of literature that are unlike the cinema of de Sica and the  music of Messiaen, but what about the artists' unique and individuating,  subjectivating, reality?</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Chapter Two consists of an essay by Colin  Gardner titled, "Bim Bam Bom Bem: 'Beckett's Peehole' as Audio-Visual Rhizome." The author argues that since the publication of Deleuze and Guattari's <i style="">Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature</i> in 1975, there has been a significant evaluation of Beckett's oeuvre in  light of the aforementioned work. Traditional readings of Beckett's work view him  as an existentialist racked with doubt and failure. (27) The Deleuzian and  Guattarian concepts of the nomadic rhizome and machinic assemblages have permitted  readers to see Beckett in a different light. Gardner shows how this is possible  as Beckett leaves "only non-signifying intensities and deterritorialized flux." (27). Rather than focusing on Becket's texts, Gardner decides to look at Beckett through a 1995 televised German production of his work <i style="">What Where</i>, originally written in 1985. Here, we move from text to image, and this allows Gardner to discuss  Beckett within the context of visual images, especially those invoked by cinema  and cinema studies. The four characters of Beckett's television adaptation,  Bim, Bam, Bom, and Bem, are analyzed in terms of nomads that continuously  undo speech and challenge what Deleuze would call a royal structure of  interpretation. Gardner concludes,</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">If, as Deleuze has  argued, the irrational apex of the modern post-war cinema is the '<i style="">unsummonable</i>  of Welles, the <i style="">undecidable</i> of Resnais, the <i style="">impossible</i> of Marguerite Duras, or what might be called the <i style="">incommensurable</i>  of Godard (between two things)' . . . Beckett's rhizomatic deterritorialization of language-as-space through exhaustion  and a 'punctuation of dehiscence' would seem to be a worthy addendum to this  list. (39)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">There is a tendency in Deleuze scholarship, and  one sees it sometimes in this volume and in Gardner's essay, to focus on the  Deleuzian concepts that aim at combating any form of "micro fascism", for example the rhizome or the nomadic, but one must not forget that the  nomadic and the rhizomatic, for Deleuze, always work together with and against  the arboreal and the royal. My question then becomes: how would these other  aspects figure into Gardner's account of Beckett?</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Sarah Posman's essay, "Where has Gertrud(e)  Gone? Gertrude Stein's Cinematic Journey from Movement-Image to Time-Image" is  a well-researched and well-written chapter that shows how Gertrude Stein  could be seen as trying to overcome the 19<sup>th</sup> century conventions of literature in order to move literature into a new form, a form deeply  impressed by the invention of film. This essay is the third essay of Part One of  this collected volume. The author carefully studies Gertrude Stein's view of movement, as expressed in her writings, and how it comes to play itself  out both in terms of images and time. Posman demonstrates how both cinema  and the work of Henri Bergson come to influence Stein's own writing. She does  this by focusing on Deleuze's <i style="">Bergsonism</i>, where Deleuze reads Bergson's <i style="">Matter and Memory </i>as the undoing of realist and idealist views of matter.  According to Deleuze's reading of Bergson, as reported by Posman, what is central for Bergson is the image and how we shape our worlds and ourselves by the  images we select and remember. "Images are quite simply all there is." (44) I am not sure this is exactly what Bergson had in mind,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup> as there is more to <i style="">Matter and Memory</i> than its first chapter, but we can understand how this Bergsonian shift  can help us rethink the way we construct images or receive them; this  certainly was the case for Stein. Posman ends her essay by maintaining: </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Using Gilles  Deleuze's cinematic Bergsonism I have not only shown how Bergson's concern for the movement  of time speaks much the same language as Stein's early portraits, that of early  cinema thriving on movement-images, I have also argued that in evolving from  her cinematic portraits to the landscape of her opera 'Four Saints', Stein announces the future of cinema in creating a time-space quite like the Bergsonian time-image. In evolving from movement-image to time-image,  then, Stein was indeed doing what, by Gilles Deleuze's account, the cinema  would be doing. (55)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The final essay in Part One, Karen Houle's  "(Giving) Savings Accounts?", examines the work of Marilynne Robinson, <i style="">Housekeeping.</i>  Houle reads the novel and the protagonist, Sylvie, in a nomadic fashion. More specifically, Sylvie  shows us what is at stake in one's life when the economy of saving and giving  are employed. Drawing from figures like Foucault, Levinas and Bataille, the  author shows how Sylvie comes to incarnate a form of life and set of relations  that falls out of the norm of thinking about these social conventions. Houle observes, </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">In <i style="">Housekeeping</i>,  the family home, the family, and the entire contents of their lives rotate away from one set of relations ('proprietary,  property, proper') towards something else entirely, some other form of life, the significance of which the novel, and this chapter, are an effort to  gesture towards. (76) </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This essay is a clear and straightforward  application of Deleuzian-Guattarian categories onto literature. It shows how one can  reread literature using a different theoretical framework. Novel in Houle's  analysis is the way she weaves together various thinkers of recent French thought  <i style="">vis-à-vis</i> Deleuze and Guattari.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Part Two of this edited volume consists of seven  essays and is the largest section of the book. The first essay in this part is  by Elizabeth Grosz and is titled, "Sensation: The Earth, a People, Art." The goal of Part II is to reflect on the relation between Deleuze and  the notions of image and art. Grosz employs the thought of Deleuze to  articulate her own thesis concerning the nature of art:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Art comes not from a  uniquely human sensibility, not from reason, intelligence, nor from man's higher accomplishments, but from something excessive, unpredictable, lowly and  animal. . . . Art is a consequence of that force that puts life at risk for the  sake of intensification, for what can be magnified in the body's interaction  with the earth. (81)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Grosz provocatively shows how great painting,  following Deleuze and Nietzsche, seeks to overcome itself, creating and undoing  forms of life and politics. (96) The painting of Cézanne, Bacon and the Papunya  and Utopia artists are employed by Grosz to show how the new forms of  painting challenge the traditional forms of art and representation.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The next essay in Part Two, Alliez and Bonne's "Matisse with Dewey with Deleuze" shows how Matisse's work demonstrates how Deleuze's notion of "superior empiricism" (104) works. Original in this essay is the use of the work of Dewey, a  philosopher not traditionally paired with Deleuze. The authors focus on Matisse's <i style="">The Dance</i>. They claim that it was Dewey, like Matisse, who recognized that art must transcend its usual  representative form traditionally localized in musea:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Dewey's book  introduces the conception of a physiology of art refusing the museological  spiritualization of the fine arts in forms that separate it from common life ('the common or community of life', 'the stream of life', 'the actual life-experience' .  . . ). It is a matter of soliciting the 'originary forces and conditions of  experience which we do not regard as aesthetic' . . . in order to intensify them.  (112)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Nadine Boljkovac's essay, "Mad Love", focuses on Chris Marker's film <i style="">La Jétée</i>. Various works of Deleuze are invoked to show how the film embodies  various Deleuzian concepts, including emotion as pure element, vision, action  and traces. In general, what is rich about the second part of this collected  volume is the use of different types of art and images, be it film, painting,  drawing, music, etc. Felicity Colman's essay, "Affective Imagery: Screen Militarism", examines the relationship between technology, aesthetics  and forms of community. She draws from the Deleuzian notion of the machine  in order to explain what changes in technology have produced, especially <i style="">qua</i> militarism. She looks at trophy videos of war and maintains,</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The parameters of  screen-based recording technologies of military cultures have shifted the dimensions  of communities, and explore how a confident movement in free communications and  information access has breached an irreparable gulf in the historical relations  between a community's economic circuit of people, and their historical  subjectivation. (143)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Colman's essay poignantly reminds one of the  deep political and critical project focus of Deleuze's work, which ultimately  aims at counteracting forms of fascism, both at the macro and micro levels.  Jondi Keanne's "Hyperconnectivity Through Deleuze: Indices of Affect" continues to develop themes of political critique that we find in  Colman's essay. Keanne's essay sets out to clarify what affectivity is for  Deleuze, and he understands it as points of intersection or indices where various  sensations intensify. This intensification of sensation shows a hyperconnectivity,  which has deep ecological ramifications. (172) In many ways, this is a very theoretical essay and probably would best belong in Part III of the  book, which is devoted to Deleuze's philosophy.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The last two essays of Part II look at  contemporary art and Deleuze as an artist. Stephen Zepke's chapter, "Deleuze, Guattari  and Contemporary Art" draws from <i style="">What is Philosophy? </i>and Deleuze's critiques of contemporary Continental  Philosophy (i.e., phenomenology) and analytic philosophy in order to show how the  former reduces reality to lived-experience and the latter produces an  info-economy of cognitive capitalism. (176) Zepke analyzes whether the Deleuzian claim concerning the sensation at play in contemporary art is robust enough to overcome conceptual and minimalist claims concerning the nature of art.  He claims that there is a robust political agenda at play in Deleuze's  conceptions of art, sensation and philosophy, but though the essay makes frequent  mention of this political project, its implications <i style="">qua</i> contemporary art are never fully developed. The final essay in Part II,  Julie Kuhlken's, "Why is Deleuze an Artist-Philosopher?", captures, I think, the spirit of Deleuze's desire to rethink philosophy in new  terms: to create concepts and challenge stagnant ones. Though Deleuze and Guattari  make the distinction between art and philosophy -- philosophy playing with  concepts -- Kuhlken makes the claim that Deleuze must be conceived as philosopher-artist, and that this is possible, especially given his own concepts of the Body without Organs and the work of Artaud. Deleuze not  only comments on art and philosophy, but also produces a genuine connective synthesis between the two disciplines.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Part III of the volume is devoted to philosophy. Constantin Boundas, one of the world's most renowned Deleuze scholars  and translators, has written an excellent essay called "Gilles Deleuze and  the Problem of Freedom." Here, Boundas deftly navigates the body of  Deleuze's corpus, especially his more traditional scholarly philosophical works,  to argue that though freedom is associated with the virtual in Deleuze, as the  work of Claire Colebrook has shown, it must be set within a series of paradoxes  that revolve around human counter-actualizing processes that unleash freedom.  </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">It may be true that  freedom is a quality of the Deleuzian virtual (as it used to be a quality of  Bergson's memory and the living force of the total past), but it is also because  of this a predicate of the human, being manifested in the latter's  counter-actualizing processes by means of which the excess of the virtual over the actual  'informs' and releases the creative act. (223) </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Boundas examines very carefully Deleuze's works  on Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant and the Stoics in order to prove his claim.  Boundas is a very astute reader of Deleuze and a very sensitive one as well. He is  the only author in this volume, I think, to appreciate fully how Deleuzian  concepts are not simply pure or unmixed. In fact, they always operate in and over  against more traditional and consolidating royal regimes. The same tension is  necessary if art, image and text are to be creative.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The final essay in this collection is by Hélène  Frichot and is titled, "On Finding Oneself Spinozist: Refuge, Beatitude and the Any-Space-Whatever." This essay examines what it means to practice becoming Spinozist. Frichot looks at various diagrams from Deleuze's  work on Foucault and shows through an analysis of three stages toward beatitude  or refuge how these diagrams can be employed in order to understand what it  means to become Spinozist. Here, Frichot plays on the relating between image  and text and, given this focus, this essay would be best put in Part II of the  book and perhaps Kuhlken's essay on Deleuze as the philosopher-artist would fit  better in Part III, which is devoted to philosophy.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">All in all, what Holland, Smith and Stivale have  given readers is a collection of texts that largely emphasize Deleuze and  Guattari's later works. I think this work makes a positive contribution to Deleuze scholarship and questions related to literature, art, interpretation and aesthetics, all a testament to the breadth and influence of Deleuze's <i style="">oeuvre</i>. Holland's very succinct introduction resists the temptation to make the texts fit a strict and overarching thematic structure, which is faithful, I think, to the  spirit of Deleuze and Guattari. As a fan of <i style="">Anti</i>-<i style="">Oedipus</i>,  I found that there was little mention of this text, especially the three syntheses. I wonder if the  three syntheses could have proved useful for thinking about art, image, text  and philosophy. My suspicion is yes, but one cannot expect a book to cover everything. In fact, Holland, Smith and Stivale are to be commended for  putting together a collection of essays that will be influential for future  Deleuze scholarship that aims at bringing philosophy and the arts into a closer relationship.</p>
