<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">This book is a defence of  rationality, at least partly, on feminist grounds. In it Heikes argues that feminists  should embrace rationality rather than giving it a bad press. There are,  broadly speaking, two strands to Heikes' argument. First, she claims that  concepts dear to feminists such as justice, fairness, equality and rights are largely indefensible without a conception of 'autonomous rationality' (p. 16).  Second, she argues that feminists should stop flogging a dead horse, since  mainstream philosophy has largely abandoned the Cartesian conception of rationality  that feminists like to flog.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">The argument for the second  strand constitutes the backbone of the book which proceeds by way of an  analysis of the shortcomings of several historical theories of rationality in order  to demonstrate that these are not shared by all contemporary approaches. In particular, Heikes claims, a virtue theory of rationality avoids the  pitfalls of Cartesian, Humean and Kantian views. The argument for the first  strand is interspersed throughout the book, but finds a more sustained treatment  in chapters 1, 2 and 9. It is this aspect of the book that I want to  consider first.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Heikes is not the first  feminist to claim that feminist political commitments can only be articulated using  moral and political concepts which are inextricably intertwined with specific conceptions of rationality. Her arguments proceed along familiar lines.  In what follows, I present them by adding some of the detail which I take to be implicit in Heikes' argument.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Feminists claim that women as  a group are discriminated against in several aspects of their lives; they also  claim that such discrimination is unjust, wrong and unfair. Heikes, quoting  Nancy Hartsock, Sandra Harding and Seyla Benhabib, argues that any defence of these  claims presupposes three broad philosophical commitments: (1) an  epistemological commitment to truth and to objectivity; (2) a commitment to normativity  and (3) a commitment to robust notions of agency and selfhood (pp. 19-21). With  regard to the first commitment, Heikes notes that it is central to feminist  views that claims about discrimination be defensible as accurate descriptions of  social reality. Hence, feminists must commit to the ineliminability of the  notion of truth (which is not to say that they must commit to metaphysically  robust conceptions of this notion). If every utterance is a mere opinionated assertion, then there is no space for feminist commitments to be  defended (as there is no space for any other commitments of any sort to be defended).  But Heikes wishes to go beyond this point and claim that feminists must  commit to some version of objectivity in epistemology. More specifically, in her  view feminists must commit to the idea that feminist claims can always be  defended by way of reasons whose normative force is binding on all.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">The second commitment is to  the existence of normative standards (p. 20). Heikes does not explicitly  elaborate on this commitment. Clearly, it minimally entails that what the majority  takes to be right, fair, true or correct is not necessarily so. Heikes appears  to think that it also entails some kind of commitment to cognitivism in meta-ethics and the epistemology of morality, but as far as I can tell  provides no explicit argument to this effect. Heikes' own commitment to  cognitivism is apparent in her sympathetic reading of Kant to whom she dedicates  chapter 5 of this book, and perhaps also in her support of rationality as a virtue  which she describes as a kind of 'responsiveness to our environment' which  requires 'learning to adapt through the cultivation of cognitive faculties' (p.  154).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">The third commitment is to  substantive notions of agency and selfhood. Whilst Heikes does not explicitly  elaborate the point in much detail, her position is well taken. It would be rather self-defeating if feminists thought that personal autonomy was neither desirable nor achievable. Nevertheless, as feminist debates on the topic illustrate this is a difficult matter whose relation to the topic of rationality is complex. It is a pity that Heikes does not pursue this  theme in any detail.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">As I noted above, the main  theme running through the book is that feminists should not reject all mainstream  theories of rationality. In order to substantiate this claim Heikes first offers an overview of various theories of rationality since Descartes. The purpose  of this overview is to show that the truly objectionable features of  classical views such as those put forward by Descartes, Hume and Kant are not  shared by their contemporary mainstream successors. Second, Heikes offers an  overview of two such contemporary theories which in her view can be combined to  result in an approach to rationality to which feminists should be sympathetic. The  two theories are Nozick's account of rationality as an evolved ability and  Audi's account of it as a virtue.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">In spite of the brevity of  the treatments, the traits of early modern accounts Heikes finds  objectionable are reasonably clear. She rejects Descartes' dualism of mind and body,  Hume's instrumentalism about reason and Kant's lack of recognition of the  social dimension of reason. However, she also thinks that there is something  worth saving in all of these views. In particular, she appreciates Descartes' commitment to the idea that human beings possess reason in equal  measure, Hume's endorsement of the importance of passions and Kant's commitment  to the universality of reason as responsiveness to reality.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">As a matter of fact, Heikes'  judgements are probably shared by the majority of feminist philosophers. I do not  see, however, why denying them should contradict any feminist commitments.  Yet this is precisely what Heikes claims. In particular she argues that that the objectionable features of classical theories of rationality make it hard  to support on rational grounds the justice of the cause of women's  equality. For instance, she argues that Hume's instrumentalism about reason makes it impossible to object to inequality as unjust unless the social utility  of equality can be shown. For this reason, Heikes concludes that Hume's  view should not be adopted by feminists. Her argument is not convincing as it stands, if it is meant to show that Humean rationality is particularly  inimical to feminism. Nothing about the argument is specific to feminist  political and moral commitments because it concerns the connections between judgments  about justice in any area of social life and facts about social utility.  Instead, it would seem that feminists, like all philosophers, could occupy either  camp of the debate about the viability of Hume's theory.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Be that as it may, there  seems to be something odd with the idea of measuring the success of general theories  of rationality by how well they can support the truth of some specific  substantive moral and political claims. Feminist commitments, even though widely  shared in contemporary society, are not uncontroversial or immune from any  possible criticism. Yet by assessing theories of rationality in terms of their  ability to vindicate feminist claims, Heikes may seem to attribute precisely  such an immunity to these claims. This is not, I think, what Heikes intends.  Instead, she must think of feminism as a prior commitment which she brings to the evaluations of theories of rationality so that both prior commitment and  theory are to be considered until some kind of reflective equilibrium is  achieved. However, it must be added that it is not always clear that this is  Heikes' intention.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Heikes describes her own  positive view as occupying a middle way between the earliest feminist views according  to which there is nothing wrong with the notion of reason and a different  voice approach according to which women's stereotypical cognitive traits --  such as emotions -- must be taken into account in a more inclusive  characterisation of reason. Heikes' middle way is based on arguing that early modern  conceptions of rationality were mistaken in several ways. Further, these mistakes were detrimental to women. These mistaken conceptions need to be replaced  with better conceptions. What makes these conceptions better is that they are  more accurate theories of what reason amounts to. Further, since these  theories include both emotions and perceptions as reasons, they are more  sympathetic to feminist commitments.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">One such theory is the virtue  theory developed by Heikes in the final two chapters of this book. An advantage  of the theory is its alleged ability to combine an acceptance of perspectivity  with a commitment to the universality of reason. In particular the theory is  intended to make it possible that some moral and political claims, such as those  that are central to feminism, can be held as 'objectively and universally  true' under some interpretation of these terms (pp. 150-1). Heikes fleshes out  this commitment to the universality and objectivity of reason by adopting a  neo-Aristotelian approach which she finds in Rebecca Kukla's work. This approach, which  is reminiscent of John McDowell's meta-ethical views, takes there to be  normative facts which can be perceived by those who have acquired by training and education the relevant set of cognitive abilities.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">In this manner a virtue  theory of rationality can make room for the contents of emotions and perceptions  to figure among the reasons for claims. These emotions and perceptions,  however, must themselves be the outcome of virtue in order to count as good  reasons supporting the truth of a variety of normative claims. In my view,  although there is much which is of interest in this approach to rationality, it  is not clear that it can make sense of differences in perspective in any but a  very superficial sense. Since reasons, as understood by this account, are universally binding there is no room for perspectives to make a  difference with regard to what counts as a reason. Of course, as it happens different individuals will have access to different reasons; but this is a fact  conceded by any account. Be that as it may, and despite my reservations about the brevity of some of the discussions in this book, there is no doubt that  Heikes has produced a salutary antidote to the allure of relativism among some feminists and as such this book is to be welcomed.</span></p>
