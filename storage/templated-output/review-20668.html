â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Solidarity is widely invoked by activists and  scholars, but philosophers have not given the concept the careful attention it  deserves. <i>Political Solidarity</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> helps to remedy this  lacuna in the philosophical literature by developing a distinctive theory of  political solidarity that distinguishes political solidarity from similar forms of solidarity and elucidates its moral, political, social, and  epistemological content. Lucidly written, theoretically interesting, and closely in  touch with the real world, this book should be read by anyone interested in  feminism, social ontology, political philosophy, or progressive politics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Scholz begins by identifying three general characteristics shared by every type of solidarity. First, solidarity is  a form of social unity that binds members together in an identifiable  solidarity group, called a solidary. Second, solidarity mediates between the community and  the individual, blending elements of communalism and individualism. The  solidary is constituted by individuals, but it is a collective entity, not merely an aggregate of its parts. Finally, solidarity is a form of collective responsibility; members of a solidary have positive moral obligations to  fellow members and in some cases beyond. These features of solidarity help to distinguish genuine solidarity from parasitical solidarity, which may  evoke some of the feelings associated with solidarity but lacks at least one  of its defining elements, typically moral duties. Parasitical solidarity is  often used rhetorically, such as when one country claims to "stand in solidarity" with another country that has recently experienced a natural disaster  yet offers little in the way of material aid.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Next Scholz develops a taxonomy of solidarities  that identifies three distinct forms of solidarity: social, civil, and  political. In social solidarity, the solidary is defined on the basis of  characteristics that members share, such as a common identity, consciousness, or experience  of oppression. These shared characteristics generate social bonds among  solidary members, as well as positive collective moral obligations. The nature of  these obligations is determined by the character of the solidary and its  degree of cohesiveness. Highly cohesive social solidaries, such as families,  entail extensive moral duties, whereas less cohesive solidaries, such as  cultural groups, entail less extensive moral duties.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Civic solidarity generally refers to the  relationship between the political state and its citizens. As in a social solidary, membership in a civic solidary entails positive moral obligations. By  virtue of their citizenship, citizens have a collective responsibility to protect  their fellow citizens against vulnerabilities, such as inadequate nutrition or healthcare, that would hinder their civic participation. These duties  are typically carried out through formal state structures, e.g.,  redistributive institutions within a welfare state.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Scholz defines political solidarity as a unity  of individuals who have made a conscious commitment to challenge a  situation of injustice, oppression, tyranny, or social vulnerability. Political  solidarity is fundamentally oppositional: it seeks to abolish an unjust practice or institution. A political solidary is unified not by shared  characteristics, as in social and civic solidarity, but rather by a shared commitment to a  social justice cause. This commitment entails positive collective moral  obligations. The content of these obligations is shaped by the particular cause, but  they typically involve some form of social activism. Importantly, the moral obligations entailed by political solidarity, along with the initial  commitment that establishes them, are the source of social unity within the  solidary. Thus, political solidarity reverses the ordering between social bonds  and moral obligations found in civic and social solidarity: in political  solidarity, moral obligations precede social bonds.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The core of the book develops Scholz's theory of political solidarity, beginning with its unique moral content. The  personal commitment to act in political solidarity establishes three moral  relations: the relationship among the members of a solidary, the relationship  between the solidary and its goal, and the relationship between the solidary and the  larger society. Each relationship entails specific moral obligations. The  relationship among solidary members entails duties of consciousness-raising,  cooperation, and mutuality. Consciousness-raising aims to further understanding of  injustice and oppression, explore new perspectives that may enhance the movement,  and evoke moral emotions, such as anger or hope. It can take a variety of  forms, including public debate, support groups, and direct confrontation. The  duty of cooperation requires solidary members to reflect on their actions as  part of a larger movement and to do their part to further its aim. Members must  also coordinate their collective action and work together to ensure that  personal relationships within the solidary reflect ideals that are consistent  with its cause. Finally, the duty of mutuality requires solidary members to  respond to the needs of fellow members appropriately and to communicate fairly and respectfully about how their collective action ought to proceed.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The goal of the solidary movement serves both as  a justification for its political activism and as a mediating force within  the group. Social criticism is the primary duty entailed by the relationship between the solidary and its goal. Social criticism refers to the moral evaluation of social practices and institutions, such as customs,  language, laws, and political institutions, and the values that underlie them.  When directed toward society, social criticism enhances understanding of  social injustices and holds oppressors accountable, thereby justifying and  furthering the solidary cause. Internal social criticism examines the values of the solidary group and ensures its means are morally justified with respect  to these values.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The relationship between the solidary and the  larger society encompasses several different relations, including the  relationship between the solidary and individuals who suffer an injustice but do not  join in the movement against it. Social activism is the primary duty of these relations. Activism can take many forms, including boycotts, door to  door canvassing, and protests and marches. Activism also has a more personal component: solidary members must examine their daily practices, revising  them as necessary to align with the solidary goal.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Some of the most interesting features of  Scholz's theory regard its ontological, social, and epistemological aspects. As we have  seen, Scholz defines political solidarity as a unity of individuals who have  made a conscious commitment to challenge a situation of injustice, oppression, tyranny, or social vulnerability. In her view, a personal commitment to a  social justice cause is the only necessary condition for membership in a  solidary; members need not possess some defining characteristic, such as a shared identity or experience of oppression. An important assumption lies  behind this view: in political solidarity, the solidary group is distinct from the oppressed group, though there may be significant overlap between the two  groups in practice. This view is controversial because it implies that  advantaged individuals, including former oppressors and those who have benefited  from injustice, can join in solidarity on equal terms with those who have experienced injustice or oppression directly.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">While Scholz acknowledges that experiencing an  injustice can provide a strong incentive to join in the struggle against it, she  offers several reasons for extending solidary membership to advantaged  individuals. To name just a few, more inclusive solidaries tend to benefit from a richer diversity of perspectives, may be able to communicate more persuasively  with others who do not readily agree with their cause, and often have better  access to power structures. Assuming Scholz is correct that inclusive political solidarity is desirable, two further questions arise: How do advantaged  members avoid reinscribing their social privilege within the solidary? And how  do people who have not experienced injustice or oppression acquire the  knowledge they need to participate effectively in a solidarity movement? Scholz  draws upon recent work in feminist epistemology and political philosophy to  answer these questions. She argues that the initial commitment to solidarity  includes two further obligations: a duty to renounce one's social and  epistemological privilege, and a duty to understand the material structure and lived  experience of the relevant injustice (or form of oppression, etc.). For advantaged individuals, coming to understand an injustice requires persistently  seeking out a variety of perspectives, including those of individuals who have experienced the injustice directly. To do so without repeating the  distortion and domination that often characterize communication across difference, advantaged individuals must practice the virtues of openness,  attentiveness, empathy, and love.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The book concludes with a discussion of another  controversial topic in the literature on solidarity: human solidarity. Contrary to  most approaches to solidarity, which posit human solidarity as a distinct  form of solidarity, Scholz argues that human solidarity is best understood as a subcategory of social solidarity or civic solidarity. As a form of  social solidarity, human solidarity attempts either to describe human unity,  typically on the basis of some shared characteristic, or to establish this unity  as a normative ideal. In either case, human solidarity entails positive  collective moral obligations, such as the duty to respond to the suffering of other  human beings. As a form of civic solidarity, human solidarity emphasizes the collective responsibility of the international community to protect the  world's most vulnerable people. Scholz contrasts these forms of human solidarity  with international political solidarity, which extends political solidarity  beyond national borders. International political solidarity can be conceived as  either a personal commitment to ending an injustice that occurs at a distance  or spans national borders, or a shared commitment among nations to a social  justice cause.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i>Political Solidarity</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> has many significant merits. By distinguishing among the various forms  of solidarity, the book brings conceptual clarity to the literature on  solidarity, in which the term "solidarity" is routinely used to refer to a wide range of social and political phenomena, from social justice movements,  to national unity, to racial solidarity and solidarity among women. Scholz  draws coherently from a number of philosophical traditions, including analytic approaches, existentialism, and feminist philosophy, to construct  arguments that are equally accessible to readers of all philosophical  orientations. In doing so, she develops a distinctive theory of political solidarity that enhances standard accounts of collective responsibility and offers fresh understandings of familiar political concepts, such as equality,  subjectivity, and rationality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">I consider Scholz's account of<i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">political solidarity to be quite plausible,  despite the fact that she herself is reluctant to embrace some of its more controversial implications. To draw out these implications, it will be  helpful to contrast Scholz's theory with other prominent accounts. Most theories  of political solidarity assume that a shared experience of injustice (or oppression, etc.) defines the solidary, thereby conflating the oppressed  group and the solidary group. It follows, on these accounts, that acting in  solidarity is a matter of engaging in social activism with similarly situated  others to oppose an injustice that affects the solidary group directly. For  instance, workers act in solidarity when they conduct a strike to protest unfair  labor practices. In contrast to these theories, Scholz argues that a  commitment to a social justice cause rather than oppressed group identity determines participation in a solidary, and thus, that the oppressed group and the solidary group are distinct. As I mentioned above, this view implies  that individuals who have not experienced a particular injustice can act in solidarity against it. It also implies that the solidary group need not  include any oppressed individuals, though it often will in practice. Thus, for instance, consumers act in solidarity with farm workers when they  participate in a grape boycott to protest unfair agricultural labor practices,  regardless of whether any farm workers join in the boycott.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Scholz's inclusive account of political  solidarity has the virtue of including a wide range of social justice movements under  the banner of political solidarity. In particular, groups that oppose  injustices occurring at a geographical distance, such as fair trade movements, act  in solidarity with those individuals who suffer from these injustices.  Similarly, groups that oppose practices that unjustly harm young children or  severely cognitively disabled persons act in solidarity with these individuals,  even if children and the cognitively disabled are unable to participate in  solidarity actions. Scholz acknowledges these cases as strengths of her view.  However, she contends that individuals can act in solidarity only with other human  beings, not with nonhuman animals or the environment. Political solidarity can  be concerned with environmental issues, she argues, but when a solidary group opposes  an environmental injustice, it acts in solidarity with the people who are  harmed by it, not with those nonhuman animals or parts of the environment that  are similarly harmed.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Scholz would be correct to suggest that acting  in solidarity with nonhuman animals is impossible on the standard account  of political solidarity, since this account requires victims of an  injustice to participate in the struggle against it, and animals are incapable of  engaging in political activism. However, solidarity with nonhuman animals is  possible on Scholz's account. As we have seen, she suggests that individuals need  not have experienced an injustice to act in solidarity against it and the  solidary group need not include members of the oppressed group. Given these claims, it  seems clear that groups that oppose practices that unjustly harm nonhuman  animals, such as factory farming, act in solidarity with animals, even though  animals are unable to participate in solidarity actions. Of course, it would be incumbent upon the solidary group to show that the targeted practice constitutes a genuine injustice, a task taken up by many animal rights theorists. However, since Scholz does not raise this issue as an  obstacle, I will assume that such efforts could be successful.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>  Scholz does, however, give two reasons in  support of her view that individuals cannot act in solidarity with nonhuman animals.  First, she asserts that political solidarity arises in response to <i>human</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> suffering caused by human actions (54). If  it were justified, this qualification would rule out solidarity with non human  animals. However, simply stipulating that solidarity responds only to human  suffering seems arbitrary if we agree that animal suffering is morally relevant,  which Scholz clearly does, as she acknowledges that feeling compassion toward  animals is sometimes warranted (220). Second, Scholz contends that the  obligation of mutuality precludes acting in solidarity with nonhuman animals. In her  words, "Mutuality, inherent in the moral relations of solidarity, mandates this requirement. In solidarity, each individual mutually forms a reciprocal relation with the group" (220). Scholz may be correct that nonhuman animals are incapable of the sort of reciprocity required by the duty of mutuality. However, it is important to remember that this obligation  applies to the relationship among members of a solidary, not to the relationship  between the solidary and the oppressed group. Moreover, if the obligation of  mutuality were applied to the relationship between the solidary and the oppressed  group, then solidarity with human beings who are incapable of mutuality,  including young children and severely cognitively disabled adults, would also be  ruled out. Thus, Scholz faces a dilemma: she must either concede that  solidarity with nonhuman animals is possible or revise her view so that it excludes  solidarity with nonhuman animals, while acknowledging that this move would also  rule out solidarity with some of the most vulnerable members of society. I would recommend the former alternative. Granting the possibility of solidarity  with nonhuman animals not only would remedy an inconsistency in Scholz's  account, it would also connect her theory with an even broader range of debates,  such as those in environmental politics and animal rights, thereby enhancing a significant strength of the book.</span>
