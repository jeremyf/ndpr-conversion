<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-GB">Wittgenstein After His</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Nachlass is a collection of  essays on philological and philosophical issues relating to Wittgenstein's  literary remains. The focus of some chapters is exclusively philological in that  they, for example, simply describe recently discovered Wittgenstein-materials.  Others focus on the significance of the <i style="">Nachlass</i> for the interpretation of Wittgenstein's philosophy and the role it  should play in exegesis, including questions relating to the editing of his  so-called works from it. Thus, while the chapters of the latter type address pertinent  -- albeit sometimes neglected -- issues relating to the methodology of Wittgenstein-interpretation, the more purely philological chapters  contribute to such aims less directly. To mention some relevant methodological  problems for Wittgenstein-interpretation, his style of writing in remarks has  sometimes invited his readers to make free use of any remark anywhere in the text  corpus that seems to support their favoured interpretation, disregarding any  questions about, for instance, how the context of the remark and/or the time of  its writing might affect its interpretation. This approach is obviously  problematic in the crude form of so-called passage hunting. More subtle, potentially problematic, forms of it exist too, as discussed below with reference to  the contributions by Peter Hacker and David Stern. Issues relating to the employment of the <i style="">Nachlass</i> are intimately connected with other interpretative questions concerning Wittgenstein's philosophical approach since the sort of interpretive  conclusions one regards as appropriate to draw from a remark of Wittgenstein's  partly depends on how one understands the philosophical purpose of his remarks generally or the aims of his writing or his philosophical approach.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Let me start with the more  directly philological contributions. The book begins with an introduction to the editorial  disputes relating to Wittgenstein's <i style="">Nachlass</i>, and a discussion of the nature of the <i style="">Nachlass</i> and its significance for Wittgenstein-interpretation. These are issues  that anyone working on Wittgenstein should be aware of, and although one  might perhaps understandably struggle to find the time to read the original contributions to these philological debates, here they are concisely and conveniently summarized. (On the other hand, to someone already familiar  with the relevant points and debates, the introduction doesn't have much new  to offer.) </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">As Venturinha observes,  Wittgenstein at his death left the copyright of his writings to selected students with instructions to publish whatever they saw fit. But the publication of  these works, starting with the <i style="">Philosophical Investigations</i>, has sometimes involved highly significant editorial decisions and interventions that are not properly explained.<span style="">  </span>As a result, the editing contributed to a misleading image of Wittgenstein as the author of completed works,  which in turn may have problematically affected the interpretation of his  philosophy. If the materials from which the works were compiled were not intended to  express any definitive and/or consistent views on a particular subject but  rather to the task of examining its different aspects, then it is problematic to  present them as anything else. A case in point: it has been argued (see Josef  Rothhaupt's contribution) that Wittgenstein's typescript TS 213 (the so-called <i style="">Big Typescript</i>) from which his <i style="">Philosophical  Grammar</i> was edited was really only meant as an archive of remarks, not a book to be published.  This illustrates that questions about the intended purpose of the items in Wittgenstein's <i style="">Nachlass </i>(his individual remarks and the larger wholes they constitute) have bearing  on decisions as to what and how to publish from it, for example, whether it  is correct to treat the <i style="">Nachlass</i> as a collection of uncompleted but potentially completable works. </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">A related desire to present Wittgenstein's writings in a conventional way, i.e., as focused on  particular topics such as the philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of psychology, colours, and certainty, has arguably led, in some cases, to obscuring  connections between different topics. Examples are <i style="">On Certainty</i> and <i style="">Remarks on Colour</i> which were extracted from the very same manuscripts but presented as if the discussions were entirely independent. But it is not evident that we are correct if we make this assumption of independence.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Behind these editorial and  philological issues lie questions about Wittgenstein's philosophical method: whether  his remarks are intended to constitute something like a philosophical theory  or a systematic account of language use, or whether they serve some other  purposes. It is in this and related ways that philological and editorial issues  connect with questions of interpretation. Here there is a risk of a vicious  spiral where misleading editing contributes to problematic exegesis.  Thankfully, however, this problem </span><span lang="EN-GB">in Wittgenstein-editorship </span><span lang="EN-GB">has </span><span lang="EN-GB">now </span><span lang="EN-GB">been fixed. For  while its earlier stages seem like a learning process towards a greater  awareness of potential problems, with the <i style="">Bergen Electronic Edition</i> (2000; BEE) the publication of Wittgenstein's  writings has reached an exemplary level of transparency. (The further development  of the BEE is discussed in the volume; see below.) The BEE makes <i style="">Nachlass</i>  items available in different formats, some of which are designed to enable the reader to get as close to Wittgenstein's original  text and to provide as much information as possible regarding Wittgenstein's revision of his texts. The BEE is also a highly flexible publication  format in the sense that it is relatively easy to add new materials to it when  such materials emerge. Two such new sets of source materials are described in  the book (see the chapters by Arthur Gibson and Volker Munz respectively):  the notes and dictations taken by Francis Skinner (with corrections and  additions by Wittgenstein himself) and very thorough and extensive lecture notes  by Yorick Smythies of which Wittgenstein himself said that he wished them  to be published. (Skinner and Smythies were students and close friends of Wittgenstein.) Whether these materials would be appropriately included  as part of the <i style="">Nachlass</i> is not clear, but certainly they are of great interest. For example, yet another item is  added to the well-known dictations by Wittgenstein from the 1930s, besides the  so-called <i style="">Blue and Brown Books</i> and <i style="">The Yellow Book</i>:  <i style="">The</i> <i style="">Pink Book</i>. (<i style="">The Brown  Book</i> is also to be revised and expanded on the basis of Skinner materials.) </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">The electronic format of the  BEE is also well suited for tracing back Wittgenstein's revisions of his remarks and keeping track of their different versions. For in effect Wittgenstein's practice of extensive revision calls for interpreters to deal with many  layers of text, making the task of interpretation multidimensional. As  explained by Alois Pichler in the last chapter of the volume, dedicated to the  preparation of a new version of the BEE, the electronic publication platform offers  various possibilities for further development, such as interactive editing,  where the readers can themselves decide how the texts will be filtered from the underlying machine readable text-base, the possibility of including  metadata about the different versions of Wittgenstein's remarks, and even  enriching the <i style="">Nachlass</i> with commentary texts as well as biographical and historical-cultural material. Which of these  possible improvements and additions, besides other more straightforward  improvements, should be incorporated into the new version is still a matter of  discussion. But there certainly are reasons to be very happy with the BEE as a  research tool. Given Wittgenstein's view that in philosophy the deformities of  one's thought shouldn't be hidden but exposed, he himself would presumably  have welcomed -- if not demanded -- maximal editorial transparency of the  kind BEE has made possible.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">The borderline between  philological and philosophical issues is blurred in a number of the volume's essays. An  example is Luciano Bazzocchi's discussion of Wittgenstein's organization of the  text of the so-called <i style="">Prototractatus </i>(an earlier manuscript of the <i style="">Tractatus</i>):<i style=""> </i>how  he composed the text and what light that composition throws on his thought. Although the discussion in this  chapter is partly purely philological, the principles according to which  Wittgenstein organized his text also have interpretative significance. The situation  is similar in the case of Ilse Somavilla's discussion of Wittgenstein's  remarks written in code and his possible reasons for using code. As she  explains, although Wittgenstein's coded remarks are mostly on ethics, aesthetics, religion  or are personal/autobiographical in nature, and may have been written in code simply to separate  philosophical discussions from private discussions, their relation to remarks not in  code seems more complicated than this. For example, there are coded remarks  on his philosophical practice, and sometimes issues originally discussed in  code are taken up for non-coded philosophical discussion. So the question arises  what grounds lie behind Wittgenstein's use of code? What might the answer <span style=""> </span>reveal, for instance, about what he regarded as philosophical topics proper, and how he understood the  relation between the personal and philosophical? Did he see these as two  different levels of writing? </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">I had difficulties  understanding Somavilla's suggestion that the coded remarks might be on issues  Wittgenstein regarded as ineffable. For, if we are talking about what the <i style="">Tractatus  </i>regarded as unsayable, aren't these mostly issues at the core of his philosophizing? Similarly it  remains unclear why a code would be a more appropriate expression for something ineffable than normal writing. Nevertheless, a very interesting  suggestion is that Wittgenstein's coded discussions of ethics, aesthetics and religion  can be seen as constituting a book to be construed out of the <i style="">Nachlass</i>  that extends beyond remarks on these topics collected in <i style="">Culture  and Value</i>. </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">A third chapter of this type  is Rothhaupt's discussion of Wittgenstein's style of writing in remarks,  explaining what the purpose and aims of this style of writing are and what kind of  larger wholes his remarks are meant to constitute. (Rothhaupt also discusses the  notion of a book closely related to that described by Somavilla, except now relevant remarks would be identified with a special 'Kringel-sign' [a circular  scribble] that Wittgenstein used for the purpose. This book would also contain discussions of anthropology and the philosophy of anthropology.)  Rothhaupt emphasizes the importance of the <i style="">Nachlass</i> for understanding Wittgenstein: his notebooks are apt to reveal the  process of philosophical struggle<b style=""> </b>that is easily concealed in a more finished text. In this way the <i style="">Nachlass</i> can -- if the role of remarks in it is properly understood -- be very instructive or even indispensable to interpreters. </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Similarly, in his essay,  Venturinha stresses the importance of knowledge of the <i style="">Nachlass</i> for interpretation, agruing on philological grounds to an exegetical conclusion. He opposes the recent suggestion that there is, in addition  to the early and later Wittgenstein, a third Wittgenstein whose work -- above  all, what is known as <i style="">On Certainty</i> -- constitutes a significant departure from the <i style="">Philosophical  Investigations</i>. The postulation of a third Wittgenstein is problematic, Venturinha reasons, both because the  argument in its support assumes the <i style="">Investigations</i> to be a complete and finished work, which it arguably is not, and  because it ignores Wittgenstein's earlier writings in the 1930s on topics discussed  in <i style="">On Certainty</i>.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Finally, three chapters of  the book are more directly philosophical, although they too are focused on the  significance of the <i style="">Nachlass</i> for interpreting Wittgenstein. The first is Hacker's discussion of the private language argument, i.e., whether Wittgenstein is committed to a conception of language as only in principle shareable or by necessity actually shared (a communal view of language). Hacker doesn't really say anything different here from the interpretation he and Gordon Baker articulated in the 1980s and 1990s in connection with a debate with Norman Malcolm. What makes Hacker's  contribution particularly interesting is the way it contrasts with Stern's. Hacker  assumes, on the basis of remarks from the <i style="">Nachlass</i>, that if Wittgenstein accepted a particular view as unobjectionable in  some context, then it must have been generally unobjectionable to him. Stern, however, contests that assumption, arguing that Wittgenstein felt and acknowledged a pull to both philosophical theorizing and a Pyrrhonian  critique of theorizing, moving back and forth between them. According to Stern,  Wittgenstein's post-1936 writings on private language represent a fresh take on how the  issue should be approached (the right tone and style). In those writings his philosophizing becomes an examination of possible ways of understanding  philosophical views and a dialogue with 'opposing voices', rather than of arguments  for and against philosophical views. It isn’t obvious which thinker is right  about these issues regarding the interpretation of Wittgenstein on private  language. Hacker's and Stern's dialogue raises important questions about the use  of the <i style="">Nachlass</i> that any interpreter of Wittgenstein should be aware of. A more directly philosophical  contribution is Joachim Schulte's engaging chapter on Wittgenstein on concept formation and  Wittgenstein's conception of the relation between concepts and facts or experience,  including the notion of something striking us as natural and its relation to what  we regard as logically necessary.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">The volume contains as  appendices two short pieces by Wittgenstein that are edited by Venturinha: 'Ramsey's Notes on  Time and Mathematics' and 'Wittgenstein's 1938 Preface' to his projected  book. The Ramsey text was originally written in German and is translated here for  the first time. The preface is a translation from 1938.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Overall, I found the book an  interesting read, even though not very rich in philosophical content. Some purely philological chapters don't really have philosophical content, but  simply convey information about new Wittgenstein-materials or discuss editorial possibilities. This is not a book, it seems, to which one returns over  and over, for example, as a source of inspiration. Nevertheless, it  certainly deserves its place in Wittgenstein-literature, especially due to its  promotion of greater awareness and methodological rigour in the employment of  source materials.</span></p>
