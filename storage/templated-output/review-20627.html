 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">David  Hyder's <i>The Determinate World</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is ambitious and challenging. It is an exciting and tough read, and it covers a great  deal of ground. Hyder constructs a careful and stimulating narrative, to make a  number of significant and well-constructed arguments concerning Helmholtz's epistemology, his relationship to Kant, and his empirical geometry. </span><i>The Determinate  World </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is an excellent contribution to the history of philosophy of 19<sup>th</sup> century  science -- those who work in the field will need to engage with this book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Bevilacqua  (1993) identifies the relevance of Kant's <i>Metaphysical Foundations of  Natural Science</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to Helmholtz's argument in  </span><i>On the Conservation of Force</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Turner  (1996) and Kremer (1993) examine Helmholtz's work in colorimetry and his  dialogues with Gra</span>β<span style="font-style: normal;">mann and Maxwell. Hyder builds on and analyzes these contexts  to show in detail how Helmholtz's relationship to Kant and his research in  colorimetry and metric spaces illuminate his arguments in his papers on geometry and  in </span><i>On the Conservation of Force</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The  subtitle of the work, "Kant and Helmholtz on the Physical Meaning of Geometry," describes its two main parts. 'Physical meaning' here has two senses. In  one sense, Hyder is referring to Kant's use of geometrical construction, in  the <i>Metaphysical Foundations</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, to attempt to isolate  the a priori relations of necessity within Newton's </span><i>Principia</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. In another sense, Hyder is referring to  Helmholtz's empirical theory of geometry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Within  this framework, Hyder constructs two historical narratives. First, he gives an account  of Helmholtz's relation to Kant, from the famous <i>Raumproblem</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, which preoccupied philosophers, geometers,  and scientists in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, to Helmholtz's arguments  in his four papers on geometry from 1868 to 1878 that geometry is, in some  sense, an empirical science (chapters 5 and 6). Here, Hyder responds to the  reading of Moritz Schlick, according to whom the "chief epistemological result" of Helmholtz's work is his argument that "Euclidean space is </span><i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> an inescapable form of our faculty of  intuition, but a product of experience" (Schlick's note in Helmholtz 1977 [1921], 35). Schlick's story papers over Helmholtz's deep relationship to Kant,  especially in Helmholtz's early work. Hyder's work here puts this relationship at  center stage, and contributes a much richer picture of the reasons for  Helmholtz's later decision to turn away from the Kantian perspective.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The  second theme is the argument for the necessity of central forces to a determinate  scientific description of physical reality, an abiding concern of Helmholtz's, and  one that, as Hyder shows, has Kantian roots. Helmholtz's commitment to the necessity of central forces was key to his responses to rival views on electromagnetism, and is a deep and often underappreciated element of  his epistemology of science.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">In  general, a central force is a force that is directed along the line between two bodies or particles. A tensor force between two nucleons is not a central force,  but the gravity pulling an object to the earth's center of mass is. Over the 19<sup>th</sup> century, work on various problems of central forces became the object of renewed study, especially in Lagrangian mechanics, with the problem of  two bodies free to move. It was found that the problem of two interacting  particles free to move can be reduced to the problem of a single free particle  acted on by a central force from a fixed point (Whittaker 1999 [1904], 77ff).  Even as advances were made in the problems of central forces, Maxwell's and  Weber's theories of electromagnetism proposed new interactions that were not  central.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Hyder  focuses on a very intriguing strand in this history. In the Introduction to  Helmholtz's <i>On the Conservation of Force</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, (self)  published in 1847, Helmholtz cites Kant's </span><i>Metaphysical Foundations of  Natural Science</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Bevilacqua (1993), whom  Hyder cites here, pointed out that Helmholtz traces his methods in </span><i>On the Conservation of Force</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to the </span><i>Metaphysical Foundations</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Hyder mines this  relationship further, and in careful detail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The  narrative that results has the virtue of supplying answers to key questions about  Helmholtz's epistemology and philosophy of science. Why did Helmholtz continue to  support a revised version of Newtonian mechanics in electromagnetism, even after  he had been exposed to the field theory in meetings with Maxwell and Faraday in  the 1860s? Why was Helmholtz so intent on constructing explanations in terms  of central forces throughout his career, or at least until the 1880s? In  what sense, precisely, does Helmholtz think geometry is an empirical science?<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">In the  case of the first two questions, Hyder argues that Helmholtz uses some of Kant's philosophical revisions to Newton in the <i>Metaphysical Foundations</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to support his resistance to field  theories in electromagnetics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;" align="left">I will claim that both Kant and Helmholtz postulate that there can only be central forces in nature (that is to say, in scientific <i>descriptions</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of nature) because of their shared belief  in the empirical indeterminacy of absolute space (3).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Hyder  traces Kant's support of this view to Kant's "<i>epistemological determinism</i><span style="font-style: normal;">," according to which causation "should not be occult", but rather, causes and effects "should be completely reflected in the extensive magnitudes of time and space" (71).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Hyder  gives a fascinating analysis here of Kant's attempt at an a priori proof of  Newton's parallelogram law of forces (55ff.). Hyder argues that Kant's proof is ultimately fallacious, which I won't evaluate here. Whether the proof is fallacious or not, the point is that Kant and Helmholtz share an epistemological commitment: that, in order for our picture of causes to  be determinate, forces cannot be referred to absolute space.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;" align="left">The crux of the matter concerns the empirical determinacy of the motions  being added. Newton does not <i>require</i><span style="font-style: normal;">  that motions be directed towards empirical points . . . whereas Kant does. In  so doing, Kant lays the ground for the claim that forces cannot have  absolute directions, a claim that Helmholtz later uses to argue against  field-theories in electrodynamics (61).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The  question of central forces thus resolves into a question of the geometrical  evaluation of motions. Can our evaluation of forces as extensive magnitudes in Kant's  sense take place with respect to absolute space, or must we accept what  Helmholtz takes to be Kant's conclusion, that all forces must be represented as  central forces, i.e., as forces exerted on a body from a fixed point taken as  the origin?<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The  argument for the conclusion is transcendental: <i>in order for our representation of  causes to be determinate</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, i.e., in order for  physical science to fulfill Kant's epistemological determinacy requirement,  forces must be represented as central. There is a question of whether the conclusion follows, but, as Hyder points out, this broader question does not affect  the historical narrative. Helmholtz clearly was committed to central forces,  he referred to the </span><i>Metaphysical Foundations</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as a source of his views on forces in </span><i>On  the Conservation of Force</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and his commitment to  central forces informs his resistance to certain elements of the field theory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><i>The  Determinate World</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is worth reading for the  preceding discussion alone, but, as Hyder himself describes it, the major project  of the book is to illuminate Helmholtz's theory of geometry and its historical development. One aim of this new interpretation is to rebut the "conventional reading, according to which Helmholtz was inspired by his physiological work because it provided him with evidence for the </span><i>inductive</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> origins of metrical relations" (6). Hyder replaces this reading with one according to which, in the 1870s at  least, Helmholtz was concerned primarily with the conditions for spatial  measurement. In particular, Hyder argues that Helmholtz's main emphasis, especially  in his latter two geometrical papers from 1870 and 1878, is on giving the operationalist conditions for empirical measurement of space.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Hyder  gives an account of the motivations for Helmholtz's adoption of this view in chapters 2  and 3, in which Hyder identifies a tension between Kant's geometry in the <i>Critique of  Pure Reason</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and his phoronomy in  the </span><i>Metaphysical Foundations</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;" align="left">If geometrical proofs involve constructive procedures, then there is no  rigorous distinction between phoronomy and geometry. But then we must be prepared  to countenance forces and force-laws that are far more diverse than those  demanded by Kant. If on the other hand we insist on arguing from determinacy to  the form of possible laws, then we will have to provide a theory of geometry that  fuses it with phoronomy. This is . . . the solution proposed by Helmholtz to  resolve the dilemma (75).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Hyder  sees one cause of Helmholtz's reasoning in Clausius's 1853 criticisms of <i>On the Conservation of Force </i><span style="font-style: normal;">(90ff.).  Another part of the motivation for Helmholtz's fusion of geometry with phoronomy,  Hyder argues, is his research between 1852 and 1866 in colorimetry (106).  Hyder's chapter here adds to and expands the detailed historical account given  of Helmholtz, Gra</span>β<span style="font-style: normal;">mann, and Maxwell in Turner (1996) and in Kremer (1993).  This background is fascinating and rich, including the contributions of  Maxwell and of Hermann Gra</span>β<span style="font-style: normal;">mann to colorimetry and to the vector calculus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Among the  significant conclusions drawn in chapters 6 and 7 are the following:<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;" align="left">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;">     </span>One aspect  of Helmholtz's positive relationship to Kant should be understood in  the following terms: </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 1in; text-align: left;" align="left">Because the task of natural science is to set up general laws, and because these  laws are to be mathematical equations whose terms ultimately resolve onto  basic spatial and temporal magnitudes, these latter magnitudes must be  determinate. But empty space is not determinate. Thus the magnitudes in question must  be determined by real things in space (172). </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;" align="left">There is evidence that this was indeed Kant's view, even in the first <i>Critique</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Thus, assuming that the voluminous  evidence he gives that this is also Helmholtz's view holds up, Hyder's work  identifies an intriguing and, to the best of my knowledge, newly recognized strand of  Kant's influence on Helmholtz in epistemology.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;" align="left">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;">     </span>Under this  framework of broad agreement there is a central and better known  disagreement: Helmholtz does not preserve Kant's account of geometrical construction  in pure intuition (179ff). Instead, on this account, Helmholtz collapses  geometry into what Kant calls phoronomy in the <i>Metaphysical Foundations</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. But Kant has it that phoronomy is a  priori, while Helmholtz makes it dependent on the conditions for measurement of  physically equivalent magnitudes. And this is at the root of Helmholtz's disputes  with the conventionalists (Hyder cites Martin Carrier as a source of this  reading). Helmholtz has it that the law of inertia describes a fact of the matter,  that bodies moving inertially traverse equal distances in equal times (189). Conventionalists respond that adjusting the laws of mechanics can make observations consistent with distinct geometries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;" align="left">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;">     </span>Hyder argues  that, in the first two geometry papers from 1868, Helmholtz is not arguing for the <i>inductive</i><span style="font-style: normal;">  character of geometrical axioms, but rather for their </span><i>material</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> character (200). Here it matters very much  what is meant by "inductive." Hyder cites Helmholtz as arguing that the question of the foundations of geometry is independent of the question  of the origin of our knowledge of geometrical propositions (200). And Hyder  explicitly is arguing against the "conventional reading, according to which  Helmholtz was inspired by his physiological work because it provided him with  evidence for the </span><i>inductive</i><span style="font-style: normal;">  origins of metrical relations" (6). Certainly, one can define "inductive methods" as "taking the sole source of our knowledge to be in experience." But another widely used definition is "Giving the conditions for making inferences based on experience that go beyond experience," that is, giving the requirements for making an inductive </span><i>step</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> in an argument. This is what is behind the  problem of induction, for instance: it is not the problem of showing that our  knowledge originates in experience, but rather of showing that we can be justified  in drawing conclusions that go beyond that experience. The problem of  induction was well known to Helmholtz, of course, as a motivation for Hume and for Newton. Certainly, Helmholtz did not think that geometrical axioms are  mere codifications or summaries of relations given in experience of material objects. But he did think, and demonstrably so, that we need to explain  why geometrical axioms can go beyond experience. Indeed, giving that explanation is not reducible to the question of the origin of those axioms in experience.  This is not at all to disagree with Hyder's overall argument, rather to point  out that "inductive" is often understood in a broader sense. To say that Helmholtz's argument in 1868 is not an inductive argument is quite  correct in the following, narrower sense: Helmholtz was not simply giving an  account of how metrical relations originate in experience. Instead, Hyder  emphasizes, Helmholtz was more concerned with proving a regulative claim: that the  system of nature should be empirically closed (211 and </span><i>passim</i><span style="font-style: normal;">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><i>The  Determinate World</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is a significant  contribution to the field. The work defends a number of innovative arguments, some of which I  have outlined above. Because of the impressive scope of the work, some of the narratives are not followed through completely: the relationship between Helmholtz's commitment to central forces and his resistance to the field theory, for instance. This is less a failing of the work than it is a reflection of the fact that Helmholtz and his relationship to the 19<sup>th</sup> century is a rich topic, and that there is much work in this context  still to be done. One of the great strengths of </span><i>The Determinate World </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is that, not only does Hyder construct a  consistent and well-defended narrative, he takes well-defined positions, on the  historical narrative and on the systematic evaluation of Helmholtz's theories. This  book should stimulate a great deal of significant debate and discussion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><i>References<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Bevilacqua,  Fabio. 1993.
