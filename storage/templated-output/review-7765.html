<p class="MsoBodyText">The simple idea behind fictionalist views is that telling or describing a story does not commit you to the existence of characters in the story.<span style="">  </span>Saying "according to the Peter Rabbit story, there is a talking rabbit" does not commit you to the existence of a talking rabbit.<span style="">  </span>Then fictionalism about <i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s is the view that the theory of </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s is merely a fiction; on one version of fictionalism, talk about </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s</span><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">should be interpreted as tacitly prefixed by "according to story </span><i>S</i><span style="font-style: normal;">", where </span><i>S</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is an appropriate story.<span style="">  </span>For example, fictionalism about possible worlds ("modal fictionalism"), as introduced by Rosen in 1990, interprets talk of possible worlds as tacitly prefixed by "according to Lewis's story from </span><i>On the Plurality of Worlds</i><span style="font-style: normal;">".<span style="">  </span>Rosen's view then reaps all the benefits of Lewis's elaborate production without needing to adopt Lewis's florid ontology.<span style="">  </span>With ontological parsimony at a premium, the appeal to metaphysicians of this easy strategy is obvious; these days, it seems that a good metaphysician should be a fictionalist about everything she can lay her hands on (or rather not lay her hands on, I should say).<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Of course, matters are not so easy.<span style="">  </span>Fictionalism about any area must be carefully argued for, and there are many technical difficulties to solve.<span style="">  </span>Kalderon's collection of eleven papers, written by top philosophers in the field, represents the breadth and width of the topic.<span style="">  </span>As well as reflecting the variety of areas amenable to plausible fictionalist treatment (possible worlds, mathematical entities, unobservable scientific entities, truth, morality, fictional characters, composite objects) it also introduces a wide variety of degrees and species of fictionalism, and tackles some of the tricky technical problems that seem to have cursed fictionalism from its beginnings.<span style="">  </span>(The taxonomies can be bewildering -- note the careful historical research required to classify any one figure as a fictionalist rather than an anti-realist of a subtly different brand.<span style="">  </span>See Rosen (chapter 1).)<span style="">  </span>The papers are all of extremely high quality, and contain important original work.<span style="">  </span>(All but Walton's piece (chapter 2) have not been previously published.)<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Kalderon's definition of fictionalism is somewhat broader than the idea presented above.<span style="">  </span>A fictionalist view about <i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s is the view that although sentences about </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s do express propositions, acceptance of a sentence about </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s does not involve belief that the proposition expressed is true.<span style="">  </span>Instead, acceptance may either involve having a different attitude than belief to the proposition expressed, or it may involve belief that some other proposition is true.<span style="">  </span>The latter case may be called cognitivist fictionalism and the former case noncognitivist fictionalism.<span style="">  </span>Examples of noncognitivist fictionalisms are the view that accepting "there are </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s" involves pretending that there are </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s, or that accepting "there are </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s" involves believing that the proposition that there are </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s is empirically adequate.<span style="">  </span>One example of cognitivist fictionalism is the view that accepting "there are </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s" involves the belief that according to some fiction there are </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s.<span style="">  </span>Another example of cognitivist fictionalism is a "world-oriented" view: accepting that "there are </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s" involves the belief in a proposition about the real world -- not the belief that there are </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s in the real world but some other belief.<span style="">  </span>This relies on Walton's distinction between content-oriented make-believe and world-oriented make-believe.<span style="">  </span>(See Walton, chapter 2, and Yablo, chapter 3.<span style="">  </span>Note that Walton uses the term "prop-oriented make-believe" instead of "world-oriented make-believe".)<span style="">  </span>In a game of make-believe, one might use the game in order to focus on the imaginary situation itself, or use the game in order to focus on the real world.<span style="">  </span>The latter is world-oriented make-believe and the former content-oriented make-believe.<span style="">  </span>Suppose that a child psychologist helps victims of the Tsunami express their traumatic experiences by playing with puppets.<span style="">  </span>A child says "all the other animals ran away and the little bird lost its mother" in order to express the real world truth that during the Tsunami the people in her village ran away and she couldn't find her mother.<span style="">  </span>This is world-oriented make-believe, because the ultimate purpose is to express events in the real world.<span style="">  </span>Accepting the sentence "the little bird lost its mother" involves believing a proposition about the world -- that the speaker lost her mother.<span style="">  </span>Yablo describes a world-oriented fictionalism about applied mathematics and pure mathematics (chapter 3).<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Another important distinction is between hermeneutic (descriptive) and revolutionary (prescriptive) fictionalism.<span style="">  </span>Hermeneutic fictionalism is the view that current usage of sentences about <i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s</span><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is what is given by the fictionalist analysis; revolutionary fictionalism is the view that usage of sentences about </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s </span><i>ought</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to be what is given by the fictionalist analysis.<span style="">  </span>(How deep can a proposal be about how we ought to change our usage of certain words, you might ask?<span style="">  </span>There's glory for you.)<span style="">  </span>Revolutionary fictionalists can consistently combine their prescriptive claim with the usual gamut of descriptive views on the current</span><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">usage of claims about </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s.<span style="">  </span>For example, they could judge all current positive claims about </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s to be false, remain agnostic about their truth values, or hold some kind of expressivism about claims about </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s.<span style="">  </span>Or things could be as Lewis suggests: the revolutionary fictionalist "might describe us -- some or all of us -- as being in a state of confusion such that fictionalism . . .<span style="">  </span>would be the minimal unconfused revision of our present state" (see chapter 10).<span style="">  </span>It's presumably not even out of the question that a revolutionary fictionalist hold a fictionalist view about the current usage of sentences about </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s and argue that we ought to hold a different fictionalist view about the usage of sentences about </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s.<span style="">  </span><span style="color:red;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Rosen (chapter 1) looks at three cases -- Pyrrhonian skepticism, ancient and renaissance astronomy and Bentham's theory of fictions -- in order to trace some precursors of modern fictionalism and distinguish fictionalism from "less exciting thoughts".<span style="">  </span>His paper develops the modern fictionalist taxonomy in the attempt to classify these sophisticated historical views.<span style="">  </span>It turns out that one important thing to watch out for is to distinguish fictionalists from pessimistic or frustrated realists.<span style="">  </span>As Rosen says, "Everyone agrees that a false claim can be acceptable for certain purposes.<span style="">  </span>The fictionalist's distinctive claim is that a false claim can be <i>ideally </i><span style="font-style: normal;">acceptable".<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Seahwa Kim's piece (chapter 4) is a very careful reply to one objection to modal fictionalism.<span style="">  </span>Even those who are willing to countenance fictions as abstract entities may believe fictions to be contingent and temporally restricted entities.<span style="">  </span>(They are contingent if the author might not have written them, and temporally restricted if they did not exist before they were first created).<span style="">  </span>It may then be puzzling how modal fictionalism can successfully analyze some necessary and eternal truths in terms of contingent and temporally restricted entities.<span style="">  </span>So you might worry that before Lewis's <i>On the Plurality of Worlds</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> was written in 1986, no modal claims were true, and that if he had never written that book no modal claims would have been true.<span style="">  </span>Kim is careful to fully develop this objection and argues that modal fictionalism needs modifying in order to respond to this objection in the most satisfying way.</span><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">From here on in I focus primarily on the contributions on moral fictionalism (Joyce, contribution 9, Lewis, contribution 10, and Blackburn, contribution 11).<span style="">  </span>My apologies for failing to discuss the other excellent papers.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Joyce (chapter 9) gives an extended and careful argument for a noncognitivist revolutionary fictionalism about morality.<span style="">  </span>He argues that if we accept an error theory about morality, then we still have some (prudential) reasons to be fictionalists about morality.<span style="">  </span>He presents some empirical analysis of the societal and psychological payoffs of pretending to believe in the claims of morality.<span style="">  </span>And he concludes that pretending that morality is after all true may help us to achieve these payoffs.<span style="">  </span>The idea is that if the passing thought of your ruined reputation won't stop you from acting unwisely, then the pretence that you are morally bad together with the strong feeling of guilt that comes along with it may be enough to stop you.<span style="">  </span>Just as exciting visual images may be more effective in selling a product than hard facts, an exciting pretence may be the best way to go.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">This is a curious though careful and persuasive argument.<span style="">  </span>Of course there may be other, more effective, tactics for improving self-control.<span style="">  </span>One expects that a fire-and-brimstone theistic view could make for quite vigorous pretenses and even stronger feelings of guilt.<span style="">  </span>Or perhaps there exist gentler forms of self-deception to the same effect, relying on rewards and positive feelings instead of guilt.<span style="">  </span>Joyce does suggest that morality may be a particularly effective pretence because we (most of us) are brought up to believe it to be true, but one does wonder what is coming next. <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Lewis (chapter 10) argues that Blackburn's quasi-realism is a fictionalist view -- a revolutionary fictionalist view.<span style="">  </span>I don't think that Blackburn really responds to Lewis's main point here, which I take to be the significance of Blackburn's projectivist preface.<span style="">  </span>("I think the fictionalist's disowning preface to all that comes after has in fact been provided in Blackburn's motivating discussion [of projectivism]", as Lewis says.)<span style="">  </span>I am reluctant to enter into this debate about quasi-realism.<span style="">  </span>But let me say a few words about Blackburn's "well-founded mistrust" of fictionalism, at least moral fictionalism, which he voices while arguing that his quasi-realism is not a version of fictionalism, (chapter 11).<span style="">  </span>(Personally, I found Blackburn's criticisms in this chapter refreshing after hearing exclusively from those sympathetic to fictionalism in the rest of the collection and, to a lesser degree, in the recent literature, and also because he was airing common suspicions about fictionalist views.)<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It is impossible to criticize all versions of fictionalism in one breath, but a widespread dislike of fictionalist views seems to rest on the complaint that they are advocating duplicity or hypocrisy.<span style="">  </span>This seems to be part of what is behind Blackburn's mistrust; as he says, "Fie upon such hypocrisy".<span style="">  </span>I'm not sure whether the charge is that this is unhealthy, despicable or simply preposterous.<span style="">  </span>(If the charge is that it is immoral, then of course a smart-alecky fictionalist will just pretend to agree while not believing himself to be in the wrong.)<span style="">  </span>In any case, Joyce gives some reasons why fictionalists should not be seen in this way.<span style="">  </span>For one thing (as explained below) when a non-fictionalist challenges a fictionalist to justify his moral views, this may establish a critical context in which the non-fictionalist will willingly retract his positive moral claims.<span style="">  </span>For another thing, it is no part of fictionalism to have the intention to deceive others or oneself.<span style="">  </span>Finally, there will be no need for deception within a group of people who are all fictionalists.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">I'd like to end with some comparison of cognitivist and noncognitivist views of revolutionary moral fictionalism.<span style="">  </span>Can each be taken equally far?<span style="">  </span>Suppose, for the sake of argument, that Joyce is right that there are good reasons for accepting revolutionary moral fictionalism.<span style="">  </span>Is he also right that a noncognitivist version is preferable to a cognitivist version?<span style="">  </span>Joyce states two reasons to prefer the noncognitivist version to a "tacit story operator" cognitivist view.<span style="">  </span>The first reason involves his notion of a critical context.<span style="">  </span>(The second reason is a more serious worry about "logically complex contexts" that I will not outline here.)<span style="">  </span>A critical context is a context in which the fictionalist is "at his most undistracted, reflective, and critical" -- the philosophy classroom, or another situation where he is challenged (by himself or another person) to justify his beliefs.<span style="">  </span>While in ordinary situations, Joyce instructs his moral fictionalist to pretend that moral claims are true, in critical contexts he is supposed to drop the pretence and express his true belief that all positive moral claims are false.<span style="">  </span>Joyce criticizes the tacit story operator view as being unable to allow for such contexts.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Does Joyce really need to allow a critical context in which the fictionalist drops the pretence?<span style="">  </span>I can think of three functions that the critical context serves for Joyce.<span style="">  </span>Joyce first introduces the critical context in order to explain why it is correct to attribute the belief that <i>P </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is false to the fictionalist, even though, while he is pretending that </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is true, all his behavior tends to indicate otherwise.<span style="">  </span>He argues (convincingly) that what the fictionalist affirms in the critical context is what determines the beliefs he has all of the time.<span style="">  </span>If the pretence were kept up full-time, then the only thing to distinguish this non-cognitive fictionalism from an expressivist position would be the fictionalist's internal mental states.<span style="">  </span>And as the fictionalist is trying to pretend deeply, even to himself, that </span><i>P </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is true, that may not be much of a difference.<span style="">  </span>So the notion of a critical context allows Joyce's fictionalist the chance to pretend deeply, even lose himself in the pretense, that </span><i>P </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is true, while still counting as believing that </span><i>P </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is false.<span style="">  </span>Secondly, Joyce may think that instructing his moral fictionalist to drop the pretence in the critical context will help to keep his epistemological powers ship-shape -- surely a wise thing to do, as loose or sloppy critical thinking would likely hurt his fictionalist elsewhere.<span style="">  </span>Finally, note that this readiness to drop the pretence in some contexts helps to respond to the charge that the fictionalist is lying or deceiving others. If they wish to discuss the issue with him in a serious and critical way, then he will "'fess up" and be straight with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The tacit story operator version of revolutionary moral fictionalism says that after discovering that morality is an error, the best thing to do is to continue using our previous discourse but we should now interpret all talk of morality as loose, sloppy, or elliptical.<span style="">  </span>For example, we should now interpret "Fred is good" as being a loose way of saying that according to story S, Fred is good.<span style="">  </span>So why is this view not compatible with the notion of a critical context where our cognitive fictionalist admits that his previous claim was false?<span style="">  </span>Joyce says "if what he said earlier concerned the content of the fiction . . . , then he does not think it was false at all".<span style="">  </span>Let me say a couple of things in response.<span style="">  </span>Firstly, the story operator view may not need the notion of a critical context to the same extent that Joyce does.<span style="">  </span>There is already a clear sense in which he believes full-time that <i>P </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is false.<span style="">  </span>Secondly, it seems to me that the tacit story operator view does allow a critical context in a different sense -- a context in which he admits that what he said previously was loose, sloppy, or elliptical and liable to be misunderstood by others.<span style="">  </span>This doesn't lead to any worries about his epistemological powers and will accommodate our intuition that he ought to 'fess up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">A third reason why Joyce might prefer a noncognitivist version of moral fictionalism is that his empirical argument for why we ought to adopt moral fictionalism may not work with a cognitivist version.<span style="">  </span>One might find other benefits to be gained by adopting fictionalism, but for Joyce, the primary benefit is in generating guilty feelings that help you not to act unwisely.<span style="">  </span>And it is the pretence that you are morally bad that is supposed to generate the guilty feelings.<span style="">  </span>Initially it may not seem plausible that uttering something that means "according to the fiction you are morally bad" can also generate guilt.<span style="">  </span>However, on reflection, I think it can.<span style="">  </span>For all that Joyce has said, a tacit story operator view may work in just the same way as his noncognitivist view.<span style="">  </span>If just hearing an advertisement can influence me to buy a box of soap powder, just saying "I am really bad" may be enough to rouse those guilty feelings, even if by "I am really bad" I mean, "according to story S, I am really bad".<span style="">  </span>It seems that the habit of talking the talk is what is doing the work here rather than any additional features of the act of pretending.<span style="">  </span>(I'm not even sure how phenomenologically different it is to say "I am really bad" and mean "According to story S, I am really bad", or to say "I am really bad" while pretending that story S is true.<span style="">  </span>That may depend on your personal style of pretending.<span style="">  </span>Is the difference that only in the latter case are you instructed to say it "with feeling"?)<span style="">   </span><o:p></o:p></p> Also relevant to the comparison between cognitivist and noncognitivist versions of revolutionary moral fictionalism is the advanced form of cognitivist fictionalism developed by Nolan in chapter 7.<span style="">  </span>Fictionalism provides a way to talk like common people (i.e., all those realists about <i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s).<span style="">  </span>Nolan investigates extending this to pretending to have the beliefs, desires, and other attitudes of common people.<span style="">  </span>This turns out to be harder than it sounds, especially when it comes to analyzing sentences about nested attitudes (e.g. I believe that she believes that there are </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">s) and mixed situations, where fictionalists use vocabulary one way while non-fictionalists continue to use it in another.<span style="">  </span>He works this out for cognitivist fictionalism, but the same kind of problem does not arise for noncognitivist fictionalism, as far as I can see.<span style="">  </span>So in a way, Nolan provides a version of cognitivist fictionalism that even more closely resembles noncognitivist fictionalism.</span>
