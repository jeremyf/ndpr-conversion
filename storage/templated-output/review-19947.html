â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ladyman</span></span><span style="">, Ross and their  collaborators (<span class="SpellE">Spurrett</span> is a co-author of  two chapters, Collier of one) begin their book with a ferocious attack on "analytic metaphysics", as it is currently practiced. Their opening blast claims that  contemporary analytic metaphysics 'contributes nothing to human knowledge': its practitioners are 'wasting their talents', and the whole enterprise,  although 'engaged in by some extremely intelligent and morally serious people,  fails to qualify as part of the enlightened pursuit of objective truth, and  should be discontinued' (vii). They set out on a 'mission of disciplinary rescue'  in the spirit of Hume and the logical positivists, in which a fair proportion of  philosophy as currently practiced -- as they realize, their critique applies far  beyond the boundaries of metaphysics proper -- will be consigned to the flames.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Unlike Hume and the positivists, the authors don't seem especially worried about the <em>intelligibility </em>of the questions discussed by analytic metaphysicians. What's got  them so riled up is the way analytic metaphysicians go about <em>arguing </em>about these  questions. As the authors see it, analytic metaphysics systematically refuses to pay attention to the considerations that are really relevant  to answering the questions, while assigning great weight to considerations  that are entirely irrelevant. Let us consider these alleged defects in turn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">What analytic metaphysicians don't do and should be doing, according to the authors,  is informing themselves, in a serious, sustained way, of the results of any  modern science beyond "A-level chemistry". The general view is that such engagement is <span class="GramE">unnecessary,</span> on the grounds  that the scientific details have no clear bearing on the questions the  metaphysicians care about. The authors think this is a mistake, since science in  general and modern physics in particular have given us grounds for rejecting many  claims that analytic metaphysicians widely take for granted. In chapter 1  (which is where the attack on analytic metaphysics takes place), this claim is substantiated mainly with bald and sweeping assertions -- e.g., that physics has shown that most physical objects are not spatially located  (18), or that <span class="SpellE">spacetime</span> points are  'pseudo-scientific' and unknown to science (14), or that the claim that everything is composed  of atoms (in the metaphysicians' sense of objects lacking proper parts) 'has no  more in common with reality as physics describes it than does the ancient  cosmology of four elements and perfect celestial spheres' (20). (In later chapters,  the tone becomes markedly more tentative and exploratory, and there is more  acknowledgement of the difficulty of extracting metaphysical claims from physics. I will discuss the claims defended in these chapters in section 2 below.) The authors don't devote much effort to figuring out which of the  presuppositions they identify actually play a crucial role in the theories in which they figure, and which of them are merely dispensable pretences adopted for  the sake of concreteness and vividness.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">There is certainly a fair amount of truth in this part of the authors' critique. But  however widespread the presuppositions might be, and however strong the  scientific case against them, this sort of critique clearly cannot vindicate the claim  that analytic metaphysics 'contributes nothing to human knowledge'. Past  scientists have made great contributions to human knowledge despite making many  false <span class="GramE">presuppositions which</span> they were in no  position to separate from their genuine contributions. Analytic metaphysicians with false  beliefs about physics might be in the same position; the authors offer no  account of the role the rejected presuppositions play that could suggest otherwise.  The heart of the authors' case thus rests on their objection to the way  analytic metaphysicians <em>do </em>argue -- namely, <span class="GramE">their</span>  view that unjustified appeals to <em>intuition </em>play a central role in  the methodology of analytic metaphysics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The concern is as old as philosophy itself. Look at any well-written paper in analytic  philosophy and you will see arguments aplenty; if the author has not done your work  for you by making a list of numbered premises, he or she has probably done  enough that you could make such a list without having to exercise too much  creativity. The arguments may very well be valid: you will be convinced that the conclusions are true if the premises are. So far, so good, you think.  Now, what about the premises -- the claims that are not the conclusions of any  argument? Where did <em>they </em>come from? (The premise factory?) You will look  again to see what your author has to say in <span class="SpellE">favour</span>  of them. Sometimes you will find an appeal to some expert authority. But pretty  often -- perhaps especially often in metaphysics -- you will find your author  saying something to the effect that the premise is intuitive, or "supported by intuition", or that its negation is "counterintuitive". After considering an assortment of examples of analytic metaphysicians saying  this sort of thing, the authors conclude that something has gone dreadfully  wrong with the whole discipline: 'the criteria of adequacy for metaphysical  systems have clearly come apart from anything to do with the truth' (13). As  they repeatedly emphasize, the questions of metaphysics are not psychological  or sociological questions; they are about the world. And what reason is  there to think that our intuitions about these questions tend to be correct,  given that 'proficiency in inferring the large-scale and small-scale structure of  our immediate environment, or any features of parts of the universe distant  from our ancestral stomping grounds, was of no relevance to our ancestors' reproductive fitness' (2)?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">It is an understandable worry, and one that metaphysicians have invited in their attempts to reflect on their own methodology. These reflections make it  look like 'appeals to intuition' are part of a distinctive <em>method </em>for  doing metaphysics, a method we could contemplate giving up in its entirety, as  the authors indeed advocate: 'as naturalists, we are not concerned with  preserving intuitions at all' (12). But very often, 'intuition' talk is playing no  such distinctive role. Often, saying 'Intuitively, P' is no more than a  device for committing oneself to P while signaling that one is not going to provide  any further arguments for this claim. In this use, 'intuitively . . . ' is  more or less interchangeable with 'it seems to me that . . . '. There is a pure  and chilly way of writing philosophy in which premises and conclusions are  baldly asserted. But it's hard to write like this without seeming to bully  one's readers; one can make things a bit gentler and more human by  occasionally inserting qualifiers like 'it seems that'. It would be absurd to accuse  someone who frequently gave in to this stylistic temptation of following a  bankrupt methodology that presupposes the erroneous claim that things generally  are as they seem. But the sprinkling of '<span class="SpellE">intuitively's</span>  and '<span class="SpellE">counterintuitive's</span> around a typical  paper in metaphysics is in most cases not significantly different from this. It may be bad  style, but it is not bad methodology, or any methodology at all, unless arguing  from premises to conclusions counts as a methodology.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">(Sometimes things get a little more involved: we find claims like 'intuition supports P  more strongly than it supports Q', or even more elaborate claims about the  relative importance of fidelity to intuition as against other considerations. But  even in these cases, I doubt anything of cognitive significance would be lost  if everything were written without reference to intuitions, e.g., by replacing 'intuition supports P more strongly than it supports Q' with a  bald assertion of 'if either P or Q, then P'.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Of course the authors are not objecting to the practice of giving arguments that rely  on premises. Their view, of course, is that metaphysicians often give  arguments with <em>bad </em>premises -- mere prejudices, which they have no good  reason to believe. But is this even controversial? Disagreement in metaphysics  is notoriously pervasive and deeply-rooted: I suppose most metaphysicians  will agree that their opponents often rely on such unjustified premises, at  least once it is made clear that this is compatible with their being  'extremely intelligent and morally serious'. The claim that metaphysicians should  stop arguing from unjustified premises is no basis for a 'mission of  disciplinary rescue'. And while the claim that they should spend more time  investigating the potential bearing of modern science on the questions they discuss is  hard to take exception with, it does not answer to the authors' aspirations.  They are looking for some much sharper criterion of methodological soundness --  some descendent of Hume's Fork upon which they can impale the unworthy  products of analytic metaphysics before pitching them onto the bonfire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">After trying out a few formulations, the criterion they end up with is the following  'Principle of Naturalistic Closure' (PNC):<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">Any  new metaphysical claim that is to be taken seriously at time <span class="cmmi-121">t</span> should be motivated by, and only by, the  service it would perform, if true, in showing how two or more specific scientific hypotheses, at least one of which is drawn from fundamental physics,  jointly explain more than the sum of what is explained by the two hypotheses  taken separately. (30)<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">In context it is clear that <em>believing </em>a metaphysical claim involves "taking it seriously" in the relevant sense. So according to the PNC, if I try to "motivate" some new metaphysical claim with an argument that does not show or suggest, of any two specific scientific hypotheses, that they  explain more together than separately, I will be wasting my time; enlightened metaphysicians ought not to be convinced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">What is puzzling about this is that it instructs us to ignore a very large class of  arguments without telling us anything at all about where they fail. Consider a  simple metaphysical argument that refers to no scientific hypotheses: 'the  statue on my desk was made this morning; the lump of clay on my desk has existed  for a long time; so the statue on my desk is distinct from the lump of clay on  my desk; so distinct material objects sometimes spatially coincide'. Or an argument that appeals to only one scientific hypothesis: 'If <span class="SpellE">presentism</span> is true, simultaneity is absolute; but simultaneity is not absolute; so <span class="SpellE">presentism</span>  is not true'. The PNC seems to say that these arguments are no good: they are  the wrong kind of arguments to "motivate" belief in their conclusions. But how can that be? What are we supposed to do, if we initially  believed the premises, and have just noticed that they entail the conclusion? Are we rationally required to stop believing at least one of the premises, so  that we don't violate the PNC by coming to believe the conclusion? This seems  absurd. Perhaps the authors' opposition to "intuitions" extends to advocating agnosticism about when statues and lumps of clay are created, though we  might note that when we are dealing with such mundane matters, the  evolutionary objection to the reliability of intuitions has little force. But if  their methodological dictum is ruling out even paradigms of fruitful interplay between  physics and metaphysics as the relativistic objection to <span class="SpellE">presentism</span>, clearly something has gone very wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">What has happened, I think, is this: the authors' self-<span class="SpellE">proclaimedly</span> "<span class="SpellE">scientistic</span>" view of the supremacy of the sciences among forms of human inquiry makes it <i style="">prima facie</i>  puzzling how there could be room for a field called 'metaphysics' that is not itself a science and is nevertheless not a  waste of time. One traditional picture imagines metaphysics as standing to  physics as physics stands to biology -- investigating a proprietary realm of facts  that cannot even be expressed in the vocabulary of physics, and that provide "foundations" for physics in the same sense in which physics provides foundations for biology. The authors are skeptical about whether there  is any such realm of facts, and thus whether there is any legitimate enterprise  of investigating them. What else might "metaphysics" be, then? They have a thought: there could be room within the overall scientific project for  a department whose members serve as ambassadors between the various fields  of science, using their generalist training to understand how the results  of the sciences can fit together into a coherent picture of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Clearly it is a good idea for there to be people who devote themselves to doing this;  indeed, some of them are already employed in philosophy departments. The authors propose that this activity should be called 'metaphysics', essentially  on the grounds that among activities that are not wastes of time, it is the one  that comes closest to fitting the traditional conception of metaphysics.  Suppose we follow them in this -- it's only a word, after all. Then we get  something that sounds a bit like the PNC: if someone is motivating a claim otherwise  than by showing how it contributes to the joint explanatory power of several  specific scientific theories, then that person is not doing metaphysics. Unlike  the PNC, however, this principle makes no use of the concept of a "metaphysical claim", which the authors do not define. To recover the PNC, we would  need some definition like this: a metaphysical claim is a claim that can only reasonably be motivated by doing metaphysics. But this makes the PNC  toothless as a criterion of methodological soundness. To apply it in any given  case, we will need some independent test for establishing that the particular  conclusion for which some particular analytic metaphysician argues is a  "metaphysical claim" in the relevant sense -- a test that we can apply before looking  at the details of the argument and seeing if it works. While the authors  evidently hold that many of the claims characteristic of recent analytic  metaphysics fall into this category, they don't provide any such test. Where Hume had his division between relations of ideas and matters of fact, and the  positivists had their distinction between analytic and empirical truths, the authors  of <em>Every Thing Must Go </em>have nothing more than a list of particular questions  about which they think that we cannot form justified opinions without paying  close attention to many scientific details. Even if they are entirely right  about this, there is a huge difference between such a list and a general  methodology for metaphysics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span class="titlemark"><span style="">* * * * * * * * * * * *</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">So far I have just been talking about chapter 1 of <em>Every Thing Must Go</em>. In the  remainder of the book, the authors attempt to do some metaphysics in the way they  think it ought to be done. Let me first give some <span class="SpellE">flavour</span> of the claims they defend; later I will say something about their  arguments. As the title of the book suggests, their central theme is that particular  objects -- 'things' -- are metaphysically second-grade. They lack 'primitive  identity' (143); they do not exist independently of each other (151); they are not 'self-subsistent' (130) and not 'ontologically fundamental' (130/1).  What's metaphysically first-grade are <em>relations </em>or <em>relational  structure</em>: relational structure is 'ontologically subsistent' (152), 'more  fundamental than objects' (145); relations are 'primary to things' (152); <span class="SpellE">relata</span> are 'are constructed as abstractions from  relations' and 'always turn out to be relational structures themselves on further analysis' (154). They call this view '<span class="SpellE">Ontic</span> Structural Realism', or OSR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Claims of this general form -- to the effect that such-and-such is more fundamental  than so-and-so, or that so-and-so is constructed as an abstraction out of such-and-such -- have been part of metaphysics since the pre-Socratics.  The authors seem to think that contemporary analytic metaphysics is founded  on the presupposition that objects are <em>not </em>less fundamental than, or constructed out of, relations. In this they are certainly wrong. Much  work in analytic metaphysics has been characterized by a suspicion of the very  concepts of ontological priority, <span class="SpellE">fundamentalness</span>, construction, etc.; this has motivated a quest to recast debates about  these questions in terms of some (supposedly) better-understood concepts, such  as those of metaphysical possibility and necessity.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup> To the extent that analytic metaphysicians have been willing to engage  in debates about ontological priority, their substantive conclusions have  been wildly divergent. If there is any consensus, it is merely that those who  want to defend claims about ontological priority should articulate these  claims in a certain kind of detail. It is not enough simply to announce that <span class="cmmi-121">X</span>s are more fundamental than <span class="SpellE"><span class="cmmi-121">Y</span>s</span>: if I want to  defend this claim, I am supposed, at a minimum, to (<span class="SpellE">i</span>) introduce a language in  which I can talk about <span class="cmmi-121">X</span>s without even seeming to  talk about <span class="SpellE"><span class="cmmi-121">Y</span>s</span>; and  (ii) make some kind of adequacy claim about this language, e.g., that it can  express all the genuine facts that we can express using <span class="cmmi-121">Y</span>-talk, or  that all the <span class="cmmi-121">Y</span>-facts supervene on the  facts <span class="SpellE">stateable</span> in the language. For  example, if I want to maintain that <span class="SpellE">spacetime</span> is less fundamental  than the spatiotemporal relations between bodies, I must describe a language for characterizing these relations, and explain how it can adequately  capture, e.g., claims about the global topological structure of <span class="SpellE">spacetime</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The authors do not submit to this discipline in any sustained way. <em>Prima</em> <em>facie</em>, if I want to describe a pattern or structure of relations, I will have  to talk about the objects among which the relations hold -- I will want to say,  for example, that <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>1</sub>, <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>2</sub> and <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>3</sub> are such that whenever <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>1</sub> holds between two objects <span class="cmmi-121">x </span>and <span class="cmmi-121">y </span>and <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>2</sub> holds between <span class="cmmi-121">x</span>, <span class="cmmi-121">y </span>and some further object <span class="cmmi-121">z</span>, <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>3</sub> holds between <span class="cmmi-121">y </span>and <span class="cmmi-121">z</span>; and so on. The authors' position seems  to require this way of talking to be dispensable -- there should be some  other, metaphysically more perspicuous, language which allows us to  characterize "patterns of relations" <em>without </em>bringing in objects, such that we could sensibly raise the question whether the facts about  patterns characterized in this way are, or are not, adequate to the task of  capturing what we are getting at in our ordinary talk about objects. But they say  almost nothing about what this language might look like. And the little they do  say shows that they have not been careful to distinguish between a variety  of very different proposals that might answer to slogans like 'relations are  primary to things', ranging from the modest to the very radical:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) The most modest claim in the vicinity is concerned only with the status of claims about <em>specific </em>objects,  like '<span class="SpellE">Shergar</span> is a quadruped' or 'this particle  is negatively charged'. The thought is that a complete and adequate  description of reality has no need for claims of this sort: everything can in principle  be said using quantifiers and qualitative predicates. If one cashes this  out in modal terms, one will arrive at the doctrine of "anti-<span class="SpellE">haecceitism</span>": that truths about specific objects supervene on purely qualitative  truths.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">(ii) A  more ambitious project that answers to many of the slogans is the so-called 'bundle theory of particulars'.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup> On this view, the fundamental language <span class="GramE">can not</span>  only do without <em>names</em> for particular objects, it can also do without quantification over them. The work of such quantifiers will be done by primitive predicates attaching directly to relations. For example, where  we would ordinarily say that there is an object that both bears <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>1</sub> to something and bears <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>2</sub> to something, our fundamental  language will say, perhaps, that <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="cmmi-121">R</span><sub>2</sub> are '<span class="SpellE">compresent</span> in the first argument place', eschewing any analysis of this in terms of quantification. The challenge for this view is to actually fill in the  list of primitive predicates in the fundamental language, in such a way that (a)  it lets us express all the legitimate distinctions that we can express by quantifying over objects, and (b) it is plausibly a genuine alternative  to, rather than a notational variant of, a language with quantifiers ranging  over particulars.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Many of the formulations in the book suggest views like (<span class="SpellE">i</span>)  or the stronger (ii). But this surely does not exhaust what the authors are  trying to do. <span class="GramE">For even the acceptance of (ii) would still  leave room for disagreement about the catalogue of <em>relations </em>that should  appear in the fundamental language.</span> For example, even if two proponents  of (ii) both accept some particular model of General Relativity as a  perfectly accurate description of reality, the first might claim that the  fundamental relations mentioned in the fundamental language include <em>being  farther apart than </em>and <em>having a greater mass-density than</em>, while the  second denies this and offers, instead, fundamental relations like <em>being  equal in volume to </em>and <em>containing a greater total mass than</em>. This  dispute might persist even if there is an acknowledged simple system of mappings between sentences about the first metaphysician's relations and  sentences about the second metaphysician's relations, such that the first metaphysician  accepts a given sentence <span class="SpellE">iff</span> the second  metaphysician accepts its image under the mapping. It is abundantly clear that OSR is supposed  to leave no room for this kind of metaphysician's debate. For example:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">According  to OSR, if one were asked to present the ontology of the world according to, for example, GR one would present the apparatus of  differential geometry and the field equations and then go on to explain the topology  and other characteristics of the particular model (or more accurately  equivalence class of <span class="SpellE">diffeomorphic</span> models) of these  equations that is thought to describe the actual world. There is nothing else to  be said, and presenting an interpretation that allows us to visualize the whole structure in classical terms is just not an option. Mathematical  structures are used for the representation of physical structure and relations, and  this kind of representation is <span class="SpellE">ineliminable</span> and  irreducible in science. (159)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">OSR's</span></span><span style=""> purported ability to dissolve many apparent disagreements about the nature of reality plays a central role in the  argument of chapter 2, which takes up themes from the debate about scientific  realism. The thought is that if we take "our best theories" to be telling us about some aspect of reality that goes beyond relational structure, then  a "pessimistic induction", based on historical examples like the theories of ether and caloric, will force us to deny that we have reason  to believe that they are even approximately true. By contrast, an  OSR-friendly reading of caloric theory is supposed to make its truth, or at least its approximate truth, consistent with subsequent discoveries. (I found it  hard to pin down exactly where OSR was supposed to defeat the pessimistic meta-induction: while OSR-savvy friends of caloric theory would not  believe that caloric exists as a fundamental, "self-subsistent", independent individual, they might still believe that caloric exists in the same  ordinary, second-class sense in which water exists -- and if so, wouldn't they be  wrong?) This line of thought would evidently carry no force if OSR required  questions about the catalogue of fundamental relations to have objectively right  answers, since scientific developments could call for quite radical changes to  the catalogue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">But one cannot simply announce that such disputes are to be dissolved: one must earn  the right to do so by describing a fundamental language within which no  corresponding questions can be formulated. What might such a language look like? At  some points, including the above quote about General Relativity, the authors  seem to suggest taking as fundamental a language in which the world is described  by reference to <em>mathematical models</em>. The idea that we should  refuse to seek an account of what <em>makes </em>a given mathematical model an apt representation of the physical world is a recurring theme in the book.  Another example:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">What  makes the structure physical and not mathematical? That is a question that we refuse to answer. In our view, there is nothing more to  be said about this that doesn't amount to empty words and venture beyond  what the PNC allows. The 'world-structure' just is and exists independently of us  and we represent it <span class="SpellE">mathematico</span>-physically via our  theories.

And  the authors clearly would want to accept many principles of this form -- not  only for isomorphism between models, but for other kinds of close relations,  such as might obtain between a model for one language and a model for another  language derived from the first model by<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b>some  simple, invertible translation function. Some rather strong principles of this form had better be true; otherwise, the metaphysicians' debates about the catalogue of  fundamental relations will carry over unscathed into the context of view (iii), in  the form of debates about the number and <span class="SpellE">adicity</span> of  predicates interpreted by the physically realized model.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[8]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">It is tempting to think that one can get by with a very simple axiom: anything that <span class="GramE">stands</span> as<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b>a <em>structure-preserving isomorphism  </em>to a physically realized entity is itself physically realized. The problem is that the standard (set-theoretic) way of doing pure  mathematics doesn't suggest any appropriately <em>general </em>meaning for 'structure-preserving isomorphism'. Rather, this kind of talk is cashed  out differently depending on the kind of mathematical entities we are  talking about: groups, or vector spaces, or whatever. Interestingly, category  theory seems to be different: there, the notion of a structure-preserving  mapping seems to be one of the central primitives of the theory. If anyone can  ever succeed in explaining category theory in a way that the larger  philosophical community can understand, it will be interesting to see if it lets us  carve out a version of (iii) out of which a principle capable of dissolving  unwanted disputes about the catalogue of relations emerges naturally, rather than  having to be written in by hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">View (iii) is intriguing and radical. But the textual evidence for attributing it to  the authors is not strong. Their talk about mathematical structures as <em>representing </em>the "real patterns" that constitute the physical world is hard to square with the idea that there is nothing more to reality than the mathematical realm. And the little they do say about mathematical  ontology suggests that they are attracted by a view on which mathematical  entities have the same non-fundamental status they assign to physical objects, as  opposed to the fundamental status required by (iii).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">If none of the languages I have considered is adequate for capturing the fundamental  facts, what is left? Perhaps our current resources just aren't up to the task:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">Certainly,  the <span class="SpellE">structuralist</span> faces a challenge in articulating her views to contemporary philosophers schooled in  modern logic and set theory, which retains the classical framework of individual  objects represented by variables subject to predication or membership  respectively. In lieu of a more appropriate framework for <span class="SpellE">structuralist</span> metaphysics, one has to resort to treating the logical variables and  constants as mere <span class="GramE">placeholders which</span> are used for the  definition and description of the relevant relations even though it is the latter  that bear all the ontological weight. (155)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Passages like this suggest the following alternative to (<span class="SpellE">i</span>)-(iii):<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">(iv) Our</span></span><span style=""> current linguistic forms  are simply not adequate to the task of characterizing the world in fundamental terms. The best we can do is to  follow <span class="GramE">the <em>via</em></span><em> <span class="SpellE">negativa</span></em>: the fundamental facts are <em>not </em>facts about particular objects;  they do not allow one to raise unwelcome questions like the one about whether mass-density relations or total mass relations are fundamental; and so  on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">This is a position that deserves to be taken seriously by those who think their purchase on  the notion of fundamentality is strong enough to make sense of it. The  challenge for defenders of (iv) is to convey some sense of what features of our  current languages could be to blame for their inadequacy. Do they have too few  basic syntactic categories? <span class="GramE">Too many?</span> <span class="GramE">Too few, or too many basic modes of syntactic composition?</span> Without  some discussion of such questions, it will be reasonable to suspect that the features of our current languages that make them seem inadequate to  proponents of (iv) are not any contingent features like these, but necessary  features of any coherent system of representation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span class="titlemark"><span style="">* * * * * * * * * * * *</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Opening up some works of analytic metaphysics, the authors found a lot of arguments they  didn't like. They concluded that they had nothing to learn from this tradition,  and went on to write a book of metaphysics that is largely uninfluenced by  anything written in mainstream metaphysics from the last forty years. But in  focusing only on the arguments, they have missed what is best and most  distinctive about the tradition they set themselves against: its gradual <span class="GramE">raising</span> of the standards of clarity and explicitness in the statement of  metaphysical claims. It is this, rather than any supposed consensus about the  appropriate methods of argument, that constitutes analytic <span class="SpellE">metaphysics's</span> strongest claim to be part of the story of the advance of human  knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Ironically, analytic metaphysicians have been much more gripped by the kinds of  concern that motivated Hume and the positivists than are the authors of <em>Every</em>  <em>Thing Must Go</em>. Much of what is distinctive about the analytic way of  doing metaphysics is meant to guard against the danger that we might  accidentally lapse into nonsense, or launch into disputes that turn out to be merely  verbal. This explains the focus, dominant since <span class="SpellE">Quine</span>,  on theses that can be stated using familiar everyday words ('there are no  numbers', 'everything with more than one part is alive', and so on). When analytic metaphysicians do introduce technical vocabulary without defining it  explicitly in ordinary terms, their approach tends to be tentative and defensive:  they propose logical constraints on the new vocabulary, and attempt to draw connections between it and questions expressed in more familiar terms,  in the hopes of thereby imposing enough discipline on its use to fend off the  charge of unintelligibility. This applies, in particular, to discussions about  the "fundamental" and the "derivative". Concerned that such discussions have, in the past, come unmoored from any standards of meaningfulness -- most notoriously, in the work of the British Idealists  to which Russell and Moore were reacting (and which, interestingly, has  many echoes in <em>Every Thing Must</em> <em>Go</em>) -- metaphysicians who  are willing to talk in these terms at all have attempted to impose some  discipline, by requiring those who want to claim that <span class="cmmi-121">X </span>is  more fundamental than <span class="cmmi-121">Y </span>to describe an  adequately expressive language for talking about <span class="cmmi-121">X </span>without mentioning  <span class="cmmi-121">Y</span>. In the work of philosophers as disparate as Russell, <span class="SpellE">Carnap</span>, Prior,  Armstrong and Fine, this constraint has been enormously fruitful: it has given us a  much more fine-grained understanding of the range of possible views about the  fundamental nature of the world, and of the challenges they face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">In rejecting the modes of argument they see as characteristic of analytic metaphysics,  the authors of <em>Every Thing Must Go </em>have, I fear, also cut  themselves off from the techniques analytic metaphysics has developed for stating  claims clear and explicit enough to be worthy targets of argument. They launch  straight into their own elaborate suite of arguments -- from the nature of scientific progress; from various facets of modern physics up to and including  quantum gravity; from claims of an anti-reductionist character made on behalf of various special sciences -- while resting content with formulations of  their conclusions that do not adequately discriminate between such radically dissimilar views as (<span class="SpellE">i</span>)-(iv) from the  previous section. The whole approach of <em>Every Thing Must Go</em> reflects an exaggerated sense of the importance of argument in metaphysics, and a corresponding underestimation of the difficulty of merely crafting a  view coherent and explicit enough for arguments to get any grip. This is a  great pity, from the point of view of anyone who shares the authors' belief  that analytic metaphysics has much to learn from a more informed engagement  with modern physics and philosophy of physics. If this desirable interaction  is to take place, it will have to be pushed forward by philosophers with a  foot in both camps, who combine a rigorous understanding of the space of  interpretative possibilities opened up by the physical theories with a metaphysician's patience for fine distinctions and quibbling objections.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[9]</span></span></a></sup> Alas, the alienated approach of <em>Every Thing Must Go </em>seems  likely, if it has any effect at all on analytic metaphysicians, merely to confirm a  few more of them in their impression that no one has yet shown how  developments in the sciences might be relevant to their concerns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <div style="">
