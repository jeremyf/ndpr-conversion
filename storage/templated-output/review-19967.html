<p>Michael Slater has written a valuable, thorough, and   thought-provoking book about William James's views on ethics, religious   faith, and the mutually-dependent relations between them. A sensitive   interpreter of James, Slater argues that religious belief informs and   enriches both theoretical ethics and practical morality in James's   philosophy and, conversely, that considerations about the theoretical   status of morality provide a certain form of justification for religious   belief.</p> 
<p>One of Slater's central and most significant contentions  is that  James's pragmatic account of religion incorporates both an  ethical view  of the function of religion and a realist view of the  objects of  religious belief and experience. To establish these claims,  he provides  a close study of James's views on ethics and the ethics of  belief,  including his "will to believe" and "right to believe" doctrines  in  "The Will to Believe" (Chapters 1 and 2); James's analysis of the   foundation of morality in "The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life"   (Chapter 3); and James's views of the practical value of religious   belief in his less frequently discussed work, "Is Life Worth Living?"   (Chapter 4). In Chapter 5, Slater analyzes the relationship between   religion and morality in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Varieties of Religious Experience</span> and shows   how, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Varieties</span>, James holds that leading a religious life is a   requirement of maximal human flourishing. In Chapter 6, he examines   James's pragmatic philosophy more generally, and focuses on James's   epistemological, metaphysical and religious views in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pragmatism</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The   Meaning of Truth</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Varieties</span>. Here (as he states succinctly in the   introduction) Slater argues that</p> 
<p></p><blockquote>In spite of certain tensions and  the occasional inconsistency in his  views . . . James's pragmatism  nevertheless manages to preserve a  commitment to metaphysical realism,  including a commitment to religious  realism (16).</blockquote>
<p></p> 
<p>Slater concludes  his book with an "Epilogue" that assesses the  broader ethical and  epistemological implications of James's ethics and  philosophy of  religion and points to their relation to those of other,  more recent  thinkers, such as John Hick, John Rawls, and Robert Audi.  He concludes  that</p> 
<p></p><blockquote>the most innovative aspect of James's philosophy of religion  is its  attempt to reconcile a commitment to religious realism with what  we  might call a commitment to religious humanism -- that is, to combine a   realistic view of the objects of religious belief with the view that   human interests and purposes ineluctably shape our conceptions of and   manner of relating to those objects (233).</blockquote>
<p></p> 
<p>As this summary  suggests, Slater's project is an ambitious one. He  analyzes both the  substantive tenets of James's philosophy and its  underlying  methodological premises and motivations, including James's  most personal  philosophical commitments. This is a particularly  appropriate approach  in a study of James, since -- both for  philosophical reasons and reasons  of personal style -- the theoretical  and personal are often  interdependent in James's philosophy.  Nevertheless, as I shall discuss  below, there also times when James  insists on their being kept distinct.</p> 
<p>It  is a mark of both the fecundity of James's philosophy as well as  its  flaws that there is room for reasonable disagreement about the  nature of  his considered views. While I do not have the space in a  review of this  size to go into detail about my agreements and  disagreements with  Slater's interpretations of James, I will briefly  discuss those I think  are most central to James's philosophy and to  Slater's understanding of  him. The major area of interpretation about  which Slater and I disagree  concerns the meaning of "realism" in  James's philosophy and the extent  to which James is a "realist." This  is a highly controversial topic  among James interpreters, having led to  numerous opportunities for reply  and counter-reply. Slater argues that  "James had a metaphysical  commitment to religious realism" (12; see  also 56-7). He holds that  "James thinks that the objects of religious  experience really exist, and  like all realities their content is not  exhausted by the ways in which  we take or conceive them" (134), as well  as that "James was (1)  committed to <span style="font-style: italic;">metaphysical realism</span> and (2) that  his theory of truth was a  type of <span style="font-style: italic;">correspondence theory</span>" (185). He  therefore rejects  interpretations according to which James believes  that the truth of  religious claims is reducible to their practical  value (3).  Nevertheless, even in the context of James's putative  realism, Slater  sees James as giving a pragmatic justification of  religious belief --  one which is perspectivalist and humanistic.</p> 
<p>The apparent problem  with Slater's interpretation is that it appears  to land James directly  in a contradiction. For on the face of it,  perspectivalism and  pragmatism are contradictory to "metaphysical  realism," the view that  there are objects and states of affairs that  exist prior to and  independent of human beliefs about them, and which  our beliefs, to be  true, must represent. While pragmatism and  metaphysical realism seem  clearly incompatible, the major contention of  Slater's book is that  "James defends and successfully combines a  realistic interpretation of  religion with a pragmatic religious  epistemology" (16). This, of course,  is a challenging hypothesis to try  to prove. Has Slater succeeded?</p> 
<p>One  possible way to resolve the apparent incompatibility between   "pragmatism" and "realism" is to forgo metaphysical realism, in favor of   internal realism, and one way of doing this is to define "realism" and   "reality" itself in pragmatic terms. This, I believe is largely what   James (at least in his pragmatic writings) attempts to do. Defined   pragmatically, "reality," however independent it may be of any   individual thinker at any particular time, is not independent of inquiry   on the whole. At important philosophical junctures James argues,   following Peirce, that reality, like absolute truth, is solely a   regulative ideal, an ideal outcome of inquiry. In my opinion, such a   projection of the end point of inquiry is as far as a humanist or   pragmatist consistently can go in their understanding of reality as   independent of human purpose and belief. It is worth noting, however,   that James posited different (if complementary) accounts of reality in   his various works. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Principles of Psychology</span>, he argues that the   sole "reality" unaffected by human judgment is the "blooming, buzzing   confusion" experienced by infants (<span style="font-style: italic;">PP</span> 462). In <span style="font-style: italic;">Essays in Radical   Empiricism</span>, however, he interprets this stream of experience   metaphysically, as the sole ultimate reality. In that work, James   contends that this underlying reality is metaphysically neutral --   neither mental nor physical -- and is open to either mental or physical   interpretations depending on our purposes and interests. Thus, in  <span style="font-style: italic;">Essays  in Radical Empiricism</span>, with regard to the status of ordinary  empirical  objects and events, James can best be categorized as an  internal  realist.</p> 
<p>This having been said, it is worth noting that James does  make some  metaphysical realist claims in <span style="font-style: italic;">Varieties</span> and elsewhere. I  believe that  this is attributable to the fact that James <span style="font-style: italic;">personally</span>  believed in the  existence of a divine reality, a "wider self through  which saving  experiences come" (<span style="font-style: italic;">VRE</span> 405). I believe, however, contrary  to Slater,  that although James was trying to do what he could to open up  his  readers to the possibility of apprehending this reality, he was not   trying to philosophically establish the existence of the divine. He   acknowledges that this belief in the reality of the divine is his own   "overbelief," i.e., his unproven personal opinion. He also acknowledges   that there is no sufficiently conclusive philosophical or empirical   proof of God's existence. Even in his discussion of mystical experience   -- that experience which James sees as the paradigm of the achievement   of religious knowledge -- he argues that while the experience of the   mystic is, and is justifiably, authoritative over the mystic   him/herself, there is no (epistemic or moral) obligation for non-mystics   to consider it so (<span style="font-style: italic;">VRE</span> 335-6). The important point to note here is  that  James is very careful to refrain from making claims about  objective  religious reality. He makes it a point to concede that what  appears to  the subject to be an independent divine reality may be  nothing more than  his/her sub-conscious self (<span style="font-style: italic;">VRE</span> 405). It must be  acknowledged, then,  that however much James personally believed in a  divine reality, and  however much he argued that there were situations  wherein individuals  could be morally and even epistemically justified  in holding beliefs  about this reality, James himself did not feel  philosophically justified  in supporting a metaphysical commitment to  religious realism.</p> 
<p>It  should also be noted that James is ambivalent about the epistemic  status  of religious belief. On some occasions he sees religious belief  as  being subject to the same confirmation conditions as ordinary  empirical  or scientific beliefs; on other occasions he argues that a  religious  system of belief embodies a distinctly different paradigm  from a  scientific one, and hence that these two systems are not subject  to the  same truth or justification conditions. What James does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> do,  in my  opinion, is what Slater attributes to him -- namely, believe  that  metaphysical realism and pragmatism are compatible. While Slater   sometimes tempers his position by calling James's commitment to realism a   "modest" one (184), I do not discern any sustainable difference, in   Slater's argument, between a modest version of realism and internal   realism.</p> 
<p>Another section of the book which I found particularly  illuminating  is Chapter 5, "Religion and Morality in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Varieties of  Religious  Experience</span>." Slater considers James's view of the relationship  between  religion and morality from both psychological (practical) and   philosophical (theoretical) perspectives. From a practical standpoint,   he argues that for James,</p> 
<p></p><blockquote>morality cannot be finally separated  from religion, because there  are moral goods that only religious faith  -- and in some cases, only  the <span style="font-style: italic;">objects</span> of religious faith -- can  plausibly bring about (7).</blockquote>
<p></p> 
<p>I agree with Slater's contention that  James believes that, from a  psychological perspective, belief in the  existence of God enables  believers to approach what they see to be their  moral commitments with a  seriousness and strenuousness unavailable to  non-believers (71).  Slater also recognizes that there are genuine  metaphysical issues at  stake in James's position, not merely  motivational ones. He recognizes  that for James in "The Moral  Philosopher," only God's existence can  provide the theoretical and  objective grounding required by James's  ethical theory that the good is  constituted by the satisfaction of  demand. For, as James argues, it is  only God who could play the role of  a systematic unifier of all sentient  beings' demands. Slater also  recognizes that James holds (in apparent  contradiction with the  position just mentioned) that a naturalistic  theory of ethics is  possible (though perhaps not fully comprehensive)  without God as its  foundation. Slater does a very good job considering  the subtle  relationship between these various positions.</p> 
<p>I think  it is important to note that no amount of ethical motivation  provided by  religious belief can provide theoretical support for  ethical theory --  James's or anyone else's. "Religion is the basis of  ethics" might be a  statement about practical morality, meaning that  "being a religious  believer is necessary to lead the most ethically  committed life," or it  might be a statement about theoretical morality,  meaning that "religious  propositions provide the foundation for an  acceptable normative or  meta-ethical theory." Slater makes the  distinction himself between  personal ethical commitment and ethical  theory (86), but he may not  sufficiently acknowledge its implications  in trying to understand the  relationship between religion and ethics  for James. James does indeed  personally believe, as is evident in <span style="font-style: italic;"> Varieties</span> in particular, that  religious believers are likely to lead  morally better lives than  non-believers, and hence that the  consequences of religious belief are  on the whole morally salutary. But  in <span style="font-style: italic;">Varieties</span> he gives no alternative  theoretical foundation of ethical  theory on a par with the naturalistic  satisfaction of demand theory in  "The Moral Philosopher."</p> 
<p><span lang="DA">Even if James's contention that belief in God provides the strongest motivation for living the highest moral life, this by itself would not establish -- vis-à-vis the "metaphysics" of morals -- that ethical value itself has its foundation in religious or divine realities. Thus, I believe that James's promotion of Christian values in <i>Varieties</i></span><span lang="DA"> remains without theoretical ground in "The Moral Philosopher."</span></p> 
<p>Among Slater's  book's many strengths is the completeness with which  he shows the many  ways in which religion and morality are interrelated  in James's  philosophy. While I have expressed some significant  disagreements with  Slater's interpretation of James, I have found his  analyses to be  perceptive and well-considered and his arguments to be  painstaking and  nuanced. James would particularly approve of the fact  that Slater  appears to display a salutary personal stake in the issues  discussed.  This book is well worth reading for its insights into James  and the  immensity of the task James set for himself, as well as for its   demonstration of, and attempt to resolve, a mass of seemingly   contradictory tendencies in James's philosophy. While I do not think   that this book rescues James from many of his apparent contradictions,   it certainly brings out some of the richest aspects of James's   philosophy and the enigmas it presents. If Slater's resolution is   controversial, that only adds to the fruitfulness of his book as a spur   to further research into the problems and promises of James's   philosophy. I should also add: do not skip over the footnotes -- they   are often very rich.</p> <p style="font-style: italic;">WORKS CITED</p>
