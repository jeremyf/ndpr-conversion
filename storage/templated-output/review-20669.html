 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This volume focuses on issues in the  epistemology of Timothy Williamson, one of the foremost epistemologists of our day. It  contains fifteen essays which are critical of various aspects of Williamson's epistemology and which have themselves been penned by preeminent epistemologists. The volume also includes responses from Williamson to  each of these fifteen pieces. It is chock full of work of the highest caliber,  as one would expect from a volume that includes contributions from so many  exceptional epistemologists. I shall describe the volume by using, if I may, a  military metaphor, a metaphor which I find apposite in this case. At this point,  ten years after the publication of <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (Oxford University Press, 2000),  Williamson's epistemology -- a 'knowledge-first epistemology', which, as the editors  of the volume say (p. 1), seeks "to reverse the trajectory of much if not all recent thinking in epistemology" by treating "knowledge as primary and [by] elucidat[ing] other notions relevant to epistemology in terms  of their relationship to knowledge" -- occupies a formidable defensive position. The authors of the essays in this volume engage in attacks on this  position, some of which are frontal, posing direct challenges to Williamson's  views, and some of which are flank, arguing that Williamson's positions are  inferior to certain alternatives. Williamson responds to the flanking maneuvers, as  well as to some of the frontal attacks, with counterattacks. Against other  frontal assaults, he endeavors to stand firm in the position he now occupies. At  the end of the day, Williamson sees no reason to quit the field. Indeed, in  the face of these attacks, he is reluctant to give any ground at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The value of this volume lies in its affording  us an opportunity to see where, in the eyes of today's leading  epistemologists, Williamson's epistemology is weakest, and why they think it's weakest in  those places. There is also value in seeing Williamson respond to his critics.  He is often in the business here of clearing up certain confusions and misunderstandings regarding what he says in <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Since Williamson means to "reverse the trajectory" of recent epistemological thought, it is perhaps to be expected that there will be the tendency to misconstrue his work. Seeing  how he clears up certain confusions helps to enhance our understanding of the  claims and arguments of </span><i>Knowledge and its Limits</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Similarly, in those cases in which he  stands in defense of the arguments of the book, we can learn a great deal from watching him use  elements of his work in new ways and from watching him make and utilize some illuminating distinctions in fending off objections. Even when  Williamson is concerned primarily to point out the shortcomings of his critics'  proposals -- that is, even in some of his counterattacks -- he often makes his points  in a way that sheds light on the claims and arguments of </span><i>Knowledge  and its Limits</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. This too helps to enhance  our understanding of those claims and arguments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">We gain the most, I think, from those  contributions which offer direct criticisms of Williamson's views and to which Williamson  responds by defending his views. So, in his contribution, "Can the Concept of Knowledge be Analysed?," Quassim Cassam argues that "Williamson's positive account of the concept of knowledge," in <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, "amounts to a kind of  analysis . . . [which] has some reductive elements" (p. 13). For Williamson,  Cassam argues, it turns out that the concept of a factive mental state  operator, or FMSO, is "explanatorily more basic than the concept of knowledge" (p. 24), where an FMSO is "the realization in natural language of a factive stative attitude" such as seeing or remembering (p. 13), and where a "concept C is more explanatorily basic than another concept D if and  only if C can be explained without using D but D cannot be explained without  using C" (p. 23). Cassam concludes that in spite of Williamson's claim that  the concept of knowledge is not reductively analyzable, he has proposed just  such an analysis of that concept.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In his response, Williamson distinguishes  between a <i>working</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> explanation  and a </span><i>theorizing</i><span style="font-style: normal;">  explanation. One gives a working explanation, he says (p. 286), when one "say[s] enough to enable someone to become linguistically competent for the first time with an expression for some concept." One gives a theorizing explanation when one "give[s] a theory about the underlying nature of a concept or its role in a wider  setting, a theory that may come as a surprise to those who already have the  concept" (p. 286). He goes on to argue, as against the claim that he proposes a reductive analysis of the concept of knowledge (to say nothing of his  helpful response to the claim that he is proposing a </span><i>non</i><span style="font-style: normal;">-reductive analysis), that in the working  sense, as well as in the theorizing sense, neither the concept of knowledge nor  the concept of an FMSO is explanatorily more basic than the other. He says  that the appearance of a reductive analysis of the concept of knowledge is simply  an artefact of conflating the notion of a working explanation with the  notion of a theorizing one. This distinction is helpful in its own right, and it  also plays a valuable role here as the foundation for a new kind of defense against  the claim that the concept of knowledge is reductively analyzable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Consider too Stephen Schiffer's contribution, "Evidence = Knowledge: Williamson's Solution to Skepticism," in which he argues that Williamson's E=K thesis supports an ineffective response  to a certain sort of skeptical argument. Schiffer is concerned with what he  calls EPH skeptical arguments, each of which involves "an uncontentious fact  E, a run-of-the-mill proposition P, and a skeptical hypothesis H" (p. 183). Such arguments follow this template (see pp. 183-4):<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;">1.<span style="">     </span>I'm not justified in believing P unless I'm  justified in believing not H.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;">2.<span style="">     </span>I'm not justified in believing not H unless  something other than E justifies me in believing not H.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;">3.<span style="">     </span>There is nothing other than E to justify me in  believing not H.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;">4.<span style="">     </span>∴ I'm not justified in believing P.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;">5.<span style="">     </span>If I'm not justified in believing P, then I don't  know P.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;">6.<span style="">     </span>∴ I don't know P.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Schiffer suggests that in rejecting this  argument, Williamson targets premise 3 and will maintain that there is something  that justifies me in believing that, say,<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">(Cube) there is a  red cube before me<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">in a good case, in which I am not a  brain-in-a-vat and in which I see and therefore know that Cube, but that does not justify me  in believing that Cube in a bad case, in which I <i>am</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a brain-in-a-vat "(and therefore I do not  know Cube), but otherwise my situation is as much like [the good case] as it's possible  for it to be" (p. 190). Now, Schiffer grants that I know something in the good case that I fail to know in the bad case, namely, that Cube. Thus, given  E = K, according to which one's evidence just is one's knowledge, Williamson  may maintain that I have </span><i>evidence</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> in the good case that I lack in the bad case. Still, Schiffer argues, it  does not follow from this that there is something present in the good case which </span><i>justifies me  in believing</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that Cube and which  is absent from the bad case. Moreover, Schiffer claims that the degree to  which I am justified in believing that Cube in the bad case is exactly the  degree to which I am justified in believing that Cube in the good case; what  justifies me in believing that Cube in the bad case is identical to what justifies me  in believing that Cube in the good case. It therefore seems to Schiffer  that Williamson may not deny premise 3.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In responding to Schiffer, Williamson identifies  two sorts of justified belief. Whether a belief is <i>inferentially</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> justified "concerns what further  arguments, if any, the subject might have for the belief" (p. 358). Whether a belief  is </span><i>normatively</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> justified  "concerns whether it is somehow OK for the subject to have the belief" (p. 358). With this distinction in hand, Williamson says (p. 359) that in the good case I am "(fully normatively) justified" in believing that Cube because I </span><i>know</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that Cube; my knowing that Cube makes it  OK, in some sense, for me to believe that Cube. In the bad case, however, I am "not (fully normatively) justified" in believing that Cube precisely because I  </span><i>don't</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> know that Cube  (p. 359). This response depends on the claim that the standard for full normative justification is nothing  less than knowledge, and Schiffer might very well object -- indeed, he might  have been objecting -- to a claim of this sort. So, for Williamson's response  to seem persuasive to those with Schiffer's concerns, it needs to include a defense -- or, at any rate, a fuller defense -- of this claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In deflecting one criticism of the claim,  Williamson says that whether or not knowledge is the standard for full normative  justification, "one can lack [such justification] without being in a position to know that one lacks it. This," he goes on to say (p. 360), "is simply the conclusion of the anti-luminosity argument in <i>Knowledge and its  Limits</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> applied to the condition  that one is not fully justified in believing Cube." Nonetheless, despite this helpful application of anti-luminosity, the claim that knowledge is the standard  for full normative justification stands in need of clarification and  support. What precisely does it mean to say that something normatively justifies me in believing that Cube? In what sense does my knowing that Cube make it OK  for me to believe that Cube? These questions seem especially pressing when we  combine a kind of anti-luminosity claim -- that I can know that Cube without  being aware that I know it -- with the plausible supposition, which might well  be one of Schiffer's suppositions, that x normatively justifies me in believing  that p only if I am aware of x.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  Of course, none of this detracts from the  overall significance of the volume, which includes many exchanges that shed  light on Williamson's epistemological views, especially as those views are  expressed and defended in <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. The exchange between Williamson and Alvin Goldman gives us a better  grasp of Williamson's E = K thesis, while his exchange with Ram Neta promotes a  deeper understanding of the claim that knowledge is unanalyzable. The  contributions of Elizabeth Fricker and Ernest Sosa, along with Williamson's responses to  them, shed light on the claim that knowledge is a state of mind. And the contributions of Sanford Goldberg and Jonathan Kvanvig, along with  Williamson's responses to them, help us to have a better understanding of the  knowledge account of assertion. All in all, the volume is an especially valuable epistemological resource: it ushers us toward a deeper understanding of Williamson's epistemology. Here in a single volume are interesting new criticisms of Williamson's views, leveled by some epistemological  heavyweights, and novel defenses of those views, defenses in which Williamson often supplements and further develops his earlier contributions. His  pioneering work occupies an important place in epistemology, and this volume is a rich  and welcome aid to those of us who have an interest in understanding and appreciating Williamson's work.</span>
