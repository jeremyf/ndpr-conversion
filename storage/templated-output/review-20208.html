 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Jennifer Ang Mei Sze's <i>Sartre and the Moral Limits of War and Terrorism </i></span>provides an  ambitious study of Jean-Paul Sartre's widely varying analyses of  violence. Traversing his massive corpus, Sze both "reconstructs" (2, 3, 4, 7, 132) and "reinterprets" (4, 7, 27, 107) her way to what she labels 'the violent Sartre.' This is a self-consciously ironic label, since the "reconstructed 'violent Sartre'" takes an "absolutist" position that prohibits certain kinds of violence, "especially when terrorist tactics are involved" (2, 89, see also 132). Undoubtedly this book will stir controversy, especially given Sartre's many incendiary  remarks about violence, which do not appear (at all) to caution against  terrorist tactics and/or the killing of civilians, at least not at first glance;  e.g., those from his preface to Fanon's <i>The Wretched of the Earth </i>[1961]  and later from essays in the Maoist revolutionary newspaper <i style="">La  Cause du peuple</i> [early 1970's].<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> While Sze offers reasonable interpretations of these polemical essays,  which render them consistent with her reconstructed view, her relative  strengths and least controversial analyses occur when she focuses on Sartre's  theoretical works, which provide this book's central focus.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">There Sze characterizes a "more moderate" Sartre who focused on subhuman situations permeated by inescapable  violence. In these kinds of "impossible" situations, inaction (and or non-violent resistance) necessarily perpetuates already existing violence. Thus, for Sartre, at least in his more sober moments, the central questions about violence do not concern whether to employ violence; rather they regard distinguishing between different kinds of violence and showing which  ones are morally excusable. Two provocative theses, then, capture the crux of  Sze's reconstructed view, here merely stated and elaborated below. First,  while violence cannot be morally justified, it can be morally excused (a claim  later qualified). Second, in order for violence to be morally excused, it must  meet certain conditions, operate within specified limitations, and be  directed towards specifically humanizing ends. On the basis of the reconstructed  view, Sze develops a Sartrean analysis of the terrorist attacks of September  11<sup>th</sup> (showing why Sartre would have opposed them), offers a critique of the  Bush administration's response, and, if this were not already enough,  sketches an "ethics of action and self-commitment" as something of an antidote to U.S. foreign policy. She delivers all of this in a very densely packed  184 pages.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This tremendous undertaking, painstaking and  punctuated with illuminating moments, makes several important gestures that will be  of interest primarily to Sartre scholars. Sze develops a strong, albeit  uneven and not fully substantiated case for a basic theoretical continuity across  Sartre's corpus. She successfully shows that Sartre's analysis of conflict in <i>Being and  Nothingness</i> should not, contrary to prevailing winds, be equated  with hostility, although with some vagueness in terms of how hostility  relates to violence. Most importantly, she sheds some clarity on, for lack of  better words, features of Sartre's normative epistemology. However, while much  can be said for this study, it also suffers various shortcomings that interfere  with appreciating its virtues. These range from stylistic and organizational matters, including but not limited to awkward linguistic constructions, repetition, a pell-mell development of central arguments, and misleading citations to more substantive problems.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup> Sze develops rather flatfooted treatments of a narrow range of secondary literature (exclusively written in or translated into English); largely  fails to treat Sartre's view developmentally (at least in the first half of  the book, notwithstanding a few remarks made during the introduction); builds  central features of her main argument on secondhand accounts of unpublished  texts; and she writes in such a way that makes it difficult to tell when she is interpreting as opposed to reconstructing a text. Given the very large  amount of material Sze covers, this review cannot offer a (chapter by chapter) synopsis of the book but rather elaborates upon a few of these  shortcomings, while addressing the book's strengths.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">That Sze offers both a <i>reconstruction </i>and reinterpretation of Sartre's corpus potentially mitigates the general  failure to treat Sartre's analyses of violence developmentally. While Sze never  clearly spells out precisely what she means by "reconstruction," she interprets and assembles texts in a way that makes Sartre's various  discussions of violence fit into one large coherent picture. The success of this  project, however, requires making the acts of sanding and assembly more explicit  than she does. For instance, Sze (more often in the first half of the book)  rapidly shifts her discussion between texts published years apart, often within a single paragraph or page, sometimes without indicating that a series of  quotes come from different texts (see for example 16-17, 21, 66-67, 109), and  often without explicit mention of the at least potentially serious problems  involved in wedding (at least apparently) disparate texts.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">To be sure, the ease with which Sze weaves  together large swaths of Sartre's corpus cuts two ways. One can describe her first  chapter on Sartre's theoretical framework as a powerful synthetic vision that  reconstructs the methods (but not the theories) of <i>Being and Nothingness</i> (BN),  <i>The Notebooks for an Ethics</i> (NE), and <i>The Critique of Dialectical  Reason</i> (CDR) into a single "unified enterprise" (28). Or, one can view it as something of a pastiche that, at the very least, fails to appreciate  many subtleties and nuances both within single texts and across Sartre's  corpus as a whole. Both descriptions are in some sense apt. On the one hand, Sze has  a strong grasp of a considerable amount of material. The first chapter  begins a compelling case for a basic methodological unity between Sartre's early  (BN), transitional middle (NE) and late (CDR) periods, which is strengthened  in the second chapter and over the course of the book. On the other hand, Sze  does not, at least initially or with much concentration, address how these  texts change and differ from one another or what the commonly perceived  problems are in terms of arguing for continuity, to say nothing of a unified  enterprise. Thus, while Sze manages to digest a great deal of textual material, her  discussion comes across as somewhat monochromatic.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Sze's analyses of questions about the  justification of violence provide (in my opinion) the most interesting but also the most  puzzling parts of her book. As noted above, she opens her book with the  provocative thesis that while violence cannot be morally justified, some instances  can be morally excused (2). In Chapter 5, Sze elaborates on this thesis when  she distinguishes between <i style="">claims about</i> violence and <i style="">uses of</i> violence (111-113). She argues that whereas <i style="">claims about</i> violence can be morally justified, <i style="">uses of</i>  violence cannot (111). Although Sze does not put matters quite this way, the gist of her discussion is as follows: in order for  reasons (that support <i style="">claims about</i> violence) to be good they must establish at least two necessary conditions: first,  a situation must be sufficiently bad (dehumanizing, rights destroying,  etc.), and, second, no means other than violence can rectify it (establish  rights and the possibility of integral humanity) (113). If good reasons can be established, then an oppressed group makes a legitimate <i style="">claim</i>  <i style="">about</i> violence, presumably as a means towards liberation.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">When it comes to explaining why <i style="">uses  of</i> violence cannot be morally justified but only morally excused, Sze's discussion is rather thin. She mentions, in passing, that  the use of violence is unjustifiable, because it is "morally undesirable" (111). The only proximal explanation she gives for this claim is that regardless of whether violence is oppressive or liberatory "violence can only bring destruction" (114).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup>  There are a couple of separate but related worries worth raising here. First, Sze  gives very little detail at this crucial juncture of her argument. Even if we  cannot normatively distinguish between different kinds of uses of violence in  terms of their destructive function, this does not seem like the only way to make  such a distinction. When pressed, Sze seems to want to maintain that we can  only be justified in our claims about violence but never in our claims about  kinds of uses. Hence, it is difficult to see why the original distinction is not  merely semantic. Second, consequently, it is unclear what work this distinction (between <i style="">claims about</i> and <i style="">uses of</i><span style="">)</span> does. It not only deflates her initial thesis that all violence is morally unjustified, but it remains unclear why this  approach does not introduce a surreptitious justification of uses of violence. Sze  might reply that even if a liberation movement is justified in its claims  about violence, not all uses of violence are excusable. Fair enough, but it is  hard to see how the conditions that distinguish excused from unexcused kinds  of uses of violence will not introduce a justificatory warrant, a point  developed below. Third, it is frequently difficult to map Sze's discussion onto  what Sartre actually says. I am unaware of any text where Sartre explicitly distinguishes between 'claims about' and 'uses of' violence. Nor am I  aware of any text where he straightforwardly argues that uses of violence cannot  be justified.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This last point raises a general worry that  hampers much of her book. Otherwise put, it is often unclear where Sze interprets  Sartre's texts and where she reconstructs them. To take one example central to  the main argument of her book, according to Sze, Sartre "demonstrated the limitations of revolutions in terms of target and the scope of destruction" (78) and she argues that Sartre considered violent attacks  on non-military targets inexcusable (78, see also 121). She refers to two  texts in evidence of this claim: Sartre's essay on Cuba, "Ideology and  Revolution," (78) and Sartre's unpublished lecture notes, known as the <i>Rome  Lectures</i> (121). However, Sze offers no quoted material (from either source) that straightforwardly, explicitly, and or unambiguously establishes that for  Sartre excusable violence must be limited to military targets.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup> To be sure, her discussion is suggestive and well taken; however, it is difficult to tease out the precise scope of limits and the nature of  targets, especially given Sartre's abstract language and apparent omissions. For instance, while the <i>Rome Lectures</i> address limitations to violence  and, hence, what Sze might call the conditions for its excuse, nowhere  according to Thomas Anderson do the <i style="">Rome Lectures</i> explicitly address the distinction between military and civilian  targets.<a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><sup>[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">To complicate matters, Sze does not seem to have  actually read the unpublished notes. (For full disclosure, I have not).  Consequently, she relies on several secondhand sources and her analysis does not seem  to me to extend much beyond what already exists in print. To further confuse  matters, when she quotes from these lecture notes, she shifts between secondhand  sources without warning, and sometimes without clearly indicating whether the  quoted material comes originally from Sartre's notes or from a commentator's interpretation of those notes, see for instance pp. 117, 120-121.  Needless to say, this makes it difficult to follow, much less evaluate Sze's  exegesis on this matter. Ironically, a great deal of her discussion of the <i>Rome  Lectures</i> notes, which provide a crucial piece of evidence for her central  argument, comes directly from Ronald Santoni's exemplary book <i style="">Sartre  on Violence: Curiously Ambivalent</i> (SV).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[8]</span></span></a></sup> The irony results from Sze attributing to Santoni "the militant interpretation" (123) or what she elsewhere labels his "terrorist interpretation" (5), which apparently fails to ascribe to Sartre any limits to the use of violence whatsoever. To be sure, Santoni does think  that Sartre overreaches, but specifically in certain texts, primarily  Sartre's preface to Fanon's <i>Wretched of the Earth</i>. For this reason,  amongst others, Santoni does not find Sartre entirely consistent in his writings  on violence and neither does anyone else I have read. To which it might be  added, whatever else one may think of Santoni's personal position on violence  as a life-long pacifist and opponent of nuclear proliferation, and even if  one disagrees with his thoughtful criticisms of Sartre, Sze's many snips at Santoni's heels are generally either misleading or false.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">With that said, Santoni self-avowedly "leans on" Robert Stone's and Betsy Bowman's early groundbreaking work during  his discussion of four considerations from the <i>Rome Lectures</i> notes  that require limiting violence (SV: 149-50). Anderson enumerates seven,  though in less detail.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[9]</span></span></a></sup> The following paraphrases Santoni's list, which Sze more or less  repeats. Violence (1) is permissible only if does not bring about further  oppressive and or alienating conditions. (2) Violence must preclude all ideologies of  Terror. (3) Violence can provide no <i style="">justification</i> other than its necessity.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[10]</span></span></a></sup>  And (4) Terror must find its origins in the masses and be taken up by the  leaders in turn. Sze places considerable expository weight on (2) as requiring that violence limit itself "to the source that created the subhuman situation" and that excessive violence undermines the "synthetic whole" of the project of liberation (121). Technically speaking, nothing here rules out targeting civilians. Perhaps, Sze would grant this and  note that if civilians were established as the source of a subhuman situation,  then they would be fair targets. It is difficult to say, given Sze's discussion  and the same can be said for Sartre, a point that returns shortly.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Sze's reading of (3) is puzzling. She interprets  it as follows: "Violence is permissible if there are no other responses except to submit to the subhuman situation" (121-22). There are two unclear matters here. First, Sze does not employ her original distinction  between <i>claims about</i> and <i>uses of</i> violence and she makes it sound like  violence simpliciter. Second, whether Sze takes "permissible" to be equivalent to "justified" is unclear. For sometimes when she uses "permissible" it sounds closer to "excused." Per her earlier discussion, one would expect her to say that <i>claims about</i> violence (on grounds of impossibility) are justified but <i>uses </i>can  only be excused, if they meet certain conditions. Whatever the case may be,  while it does seem plausible to read Sartre as saying here that the only  justification of violence can be because it is sometimes necessary to liberate  severely oppressed peoples, it remains unclear why uses of violence would not be justified on these grounds, to say nothing of whether Sartre here means  moral justification or some other kind of justification. And it would be  helpful were Sze to elaborate at greater length and with more clarity upon why what  Sartre says (here and in other places) does not constitute moral justification  for the uses of violence, why one can only morally excuse uses of violence, what  the difference is between excuse and justification, and why the distinction  is important. </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">There seem to me two basic problems here. On the  one hand, Sze might want to say that the conditions of excuse somehow stand  outside of and above moral considerations. Outside, since they are not moral in  nature, and above, since they take precedence over moral undesirability. But in  this case, why call such cases <i>morally</i> excusable uses of violence,  since the excuses would stand on some non-moral but unidentified grounds? On the  other hand, more problematically, if the excuses of the uses of violence are  moral, as Sze earlier claims, then it is unclear how this distinction really  amounts to anything more than pure semantics. Does not morally excusing uses of violence morally justify it?</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">However the theoretical dust settles, Sartre's  discussion reaches such heights of abstraction that three additional worries should  be mentioned. First, it renders him open to misinterpretation. Second, the  textual evidence does not support any uncontroversial interpretation, even  though the text rules out some interpretations as clearly mistaken. Third, building  upon a worry mentioned by Robert Stone and Betsy Bowman, because Sartre is "disappointingly abstract," given the gravity of these issues such abstract language is not merely disappointing but extremely dangerous, a  matter Sze would do well to take more seriously.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[11]</span></span></a></sup> It is very difficult to illuminate the precise nature of the limits and  targets of what Sartre takes to be acceptable uses of violence, to say nothing  of determining what actual situations would meet the conditions of  acceptability. In my view, the gravity of the issue of violence obligates theoreticians  to higher standards of clarity than usual and Sze oversteps when she  introduces her study with the audacious claim that "Sartre's position on violence  has been consistently clear" (2). To be sure, she cautiously seems to change her appraisal later in her study when she claims that Sartre "<i style="">may</i> not have been clear at times" (113, emphasis added). May?</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In an interview from 1960, Sartre explains:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">When I entered the  Ecole Normale, no one . . . would have dared to say that one should refuse  violence. Our concern was principally to channel it, to limit it. A well behaved violence, and profitable. We were for the most part very mild, and yet  we had become creatures of violence because one of our problems was to know  whether a given action was an act of revolutionary violence or whether it went  beyond <i>justifiable</i> revolutionary violence. The problem remained with us. We shall never  solve it.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[12]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">I leave it up to commentators to determine  whether Sartre here projects his contemporary thoughts on violence back thirty years  and also how to weigh the last sentence. My point is that Sze captures the spirit  of Sartre's thinking on violence in the 1960's and 1970's. However, while I  am in full sympathy with the spirit of her project, <i>Sartre and the Moral  Limits of War and Terrorism </i>reads unevenly and one has to work hard to dig out  its insights. In the end, Sze shows tremendous potential and covers an extraordinary amount of material. On the basis of this study of  violence, one would reasonably expect her to produce an exceptional work in the  future.</p>    <div style="">
  <hr size="1" width="33%" align="left">    <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup>  To take but one well known example from the former: "to shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he  oppresses at the same time: there remains a dead man and a free man." Quote taken from the original Grove Press edition, 1963, p. 22. </p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup>  Here are a few examples of misleading citations. Sze criticizes a claim made by  Mary Warnock (21) but never directly references any of Warnock's work; the  footnote at the end of her rebuttal refers to Thomas Anderson's work (189). This  might seem trivial, except that Sze has something of a habit of making claims  about texts when it is unclear that she has actually read them firsthand. For instance, when Sze discusses Sartre's early essay "Materialism and Revolution" [1946] (109-10), all of her quotes come from Ronald  Santoni's <i style="">Sartre on Violence</i>. Worse, Sze grounds much of her case that Sartre argues for limitations to violence on his unpublished notes referred to as the <i style="">Rome Lectures</i>. Not only does it appear that Sze has not read the notes,  and I have not; she cites various different secondhand sources, shifting  between them without any indication in the text: sometimes her quotes are from  Sartre, sometimes they are secondhand commentary, or based upon secondhand  commentary, (it is difficult to tell), see especially pp. (120-23). In a similar  vein, Sze references Wikipedia pages, where it would have made sense to refer to  official government documents, e.g., the National Security Strategy, during her discussion of the second Bush administration's doctrine of preemption  (123). She sometimes cites quotes without specific page references; see for  example her references in Chapters four and five to the <i>New Orleans Session</i>  on the terrorist attacks on 9-11 at the North American Sartre Society  meeting in March, 2002, and published in <i>Sartre Studies International</i>, 9:2, (December: 2003), pp. 9-25. </p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><span style="">[3]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=""> To be clear, this objection is not to the spirit of Sze's analysis but to its letter, since, in my opinion,  Sartre's major theoretical works are, at least, thinly continuous. However, a  persuasive case for a unified enterprise requires more attention to the marked and  well-known tensions and discontinuities between the different developmental stages  than Sze provides.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup>  Sze also discusses the relationship between the destructive nature of violence  and justification on p. 119. There she repeats the claim that uses of  violence cannot be morally good because they are destructive, referring to p. 404  of the <i>Notebooks for an Ethics</i> in support of this claim. There Sartre  depicts the violence of revolt as ambiguous: "Revolt is both the assumption of  Evil and the destruction of Evil" (NE: 404). Whatever the case may be, Sze flattens Sartre's complicated analysis when she claim straightforwardly, "Sartre deemed that the act of violence in all projects of violence (antagonistic or revolutionary) entails the destruction of the other and therefore cannot be morally good" (119).</p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup>  A qualification is in order. In Sartre's posthumously published <i style="">Notebooks for an Ethics</i> violence has a paradoxical air about it. When Sartre employs the word "justification" he is almost always talking about false rationalizations of violence. But to show that many justifications of  the use of violence are in bad faith does not explain why all justifications  must be in bad faith. When Sartre speaks about a slave revolting, he says, "let us try to understand it in its ambiguity and to legitimate violence" (NE: 398). It is difficult to tell whether and to what extent Sartre uses  these words "justified" and "legitimate" differently. Sze herself is not entirely clear and sometimes shifts between uses of "legitimate" and "justified" in her discussion, see especially 111-114. </p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup>  Sze also makes a parallel when she addresses Sartre's controversial essay in <i>La  Cause du peuple -- J'accuse, </i>No. 29, du 15, Oct. 1972, where he discusses  the events of the Munich summer Olympic games (101-103). Palestinians  attacked Israelis in their quarters, killing two Israeli athletes, and taking  other athletes and coaches hostage. Their aim was to negotiate a hostage  exchange with the Israeli government. Sze argues that Sartre saw the Palestinian  cause as legitimate but condemned their terrorist tactics of killing innocent athletes (101-103). In this way, she reads this essay as showing how  Sartre saw the Palestinians as having a legitimate claim to using violence but  employing an inexcusable form. Sartre's discussion in this essay is ambiguous and  can be read in different ways. However one reads it, these ambiguities should  be mentioned. A translation of this essay by Betsy Bowman has been  published in <i>Sartre Studies International</i>, 9:2, (2003).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""# 37.</p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[8]</span></span></a></sup>  (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2003.</p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[9]</span></span></a></sup>  Op. cit. pp. 127-28.</p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[10]</span></span></a></sup>  Sze renders (3) like this: "Third, violence is permitted '[o]nly if no [reason] of  Terror is offered other than its <i style="">necessity</i>'" (121).
