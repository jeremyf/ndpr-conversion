 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Theodore Brown is the  ultimate academic all-rounder. A distinguished research chemist, author of a best-selling chemistry textbook, founding director of what is arguably America's  leading research unit that actually lives up to its 'interdisciplinary' remit (University of Illinois' Beckman Institute), a vice chancellor for  research and the author of a respectable, liberal-minded book on metaphor as the  lifeblood of scientific creativity (Brown 2003). In fact, were it not for his  apparent lack of interest in geopolitical manoeuvring, Brown's career might be comparable to that of another indefatigable 20<sup>th</sup> century  American chemist, James Bryant Conant, the mentor of Thomas Kuhn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">But as readers of this  journal would have asked of Conant, how is Brown as a <i>philosopher</i></span><span lang="EN-GB">? Whatever verdict one wishes to deliver on Conant as a  philosopher of science, it is clear that he treated the positivist and pragmatist philosophies of his day more as inputs than authorities. Thus, Conant  freely picked and mixed what he needed from them to clarify and justify the  benevolent but elite role that he would have science play in the Cold War era. In contrast, Brown appears to be only as good as the intellectual agents he  works with. Consequently, there are few interesting emergent properties from  their combination. Brown's deferential approach means that his book could be  easily mistaken for a lightly revised Ph.D. thesis by an above average student  of naturalised analytic philosophy. Put a bit more positively, while this  book is priced as if it were a specialist monograph, it could have been marketed  in paperback as an introductory textbook in applied epistemology and ethics  of contemporary science.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">To his credit, Brown begins  by asking some of the right questions about the foundations of science's epistemic  and moral authority. Unfortunately he fails to see the need to range far beyond  the precincts of contemporary analytic epistemology and constructivist  sociology of science into the heart of political theory. Two of Brown's questions  that demand more adventurous political treatment stand out:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span lang="EN-GB">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;">     </span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><i>How does science manage to exert authority in society  without having to rely on coercion for its enforcement?</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> This is not to say that politicians, not to mention ordinary folks,  sometimes act and speak in defiance of received scientific wisdom, but in those  cases a presumption of irrationality hangs over them, which then effectively circumscribes <i>their</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> authority.  Moreover, it is not to deny that bad policies have been made with science's authority.  However, the policymakers are usually dealt with much more roughly than the  scientists they listened to. Before the globalisation of science, only the  established churches in particular nation-states had exerted authority in just this  way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span lang="EN-GB">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;">     </span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><i>How does science manage to sustain its authority over  so many matters while remaining so restrictive over who can exert such  authority?</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> This is what sociologists after  Thomas Gieryn call science's 'boundary maintenance' problem. The Protestant reformers originally drew attention to a problem of this sort vis-à-vis the authority exerted by  the Church of Rome over Christendom. They pointed to the tension between a self-avowed 'universal church' of notionally equal believers whose  secular and spiritual probity is nevertheless routinely vetted by an expert clerical  class. As more people became capable of evaluating clerical judgements for  themselves -- via mass literacy and Biblical criticism -- it became increasingly  difficult to close ranks against heretics, who in many cases split to form  alternative churches. Science's boundary maintenance is undergoing a similar  challenge in our own time. Here the internet corresponds to the printing press, and  the result is what Fuller (2010) refers to as 'Protscience'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Brown rightly sees science's  epistemic and moral authority as mutually implicated via the concept of <i>autonomy</i></span><span lang="EN-GB">, though his take on this concept -- due to Michael  Polanyi, Robert Merton and Gerald Holton -- leaves much to be desired. In particular,  Brown supposes that the matters on which scientists are most likely to be in agreement correspond to some epistemically and morally relevant sense of 'science' as a sphere of social life that can be neatly demarcated from,  say, politics or religion. However, this view is undermined by a centrepiece  of Brown's own analysis: the US Supreme Court case of <i>Daubert v. Merrell  Dow</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> (1993). Credible scientific witnesses  were to be found on both sides of this so-called 'toxic tort' case, leading the justices to draft guidelines for the assessment of scientific testimony. They basically  settled for a snapshot view of the aggregate drift of researcher opinion at the  moment of decision, underscoring that future research may force the ruling to  be re-examined and even overturned. While the subsequent legal debate has  focussed mainly on, so to speak, how to take the snapshot of the relevant  science, <i>Daubert</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> conceded that the  locus of autonomy of science ultimately resides in individual scientists, each of whom follows the path of inquiry  wherever it leads, the overall result of which presumptively passes for a  'scientific consensus' at any given time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Unfortunately most accounts  of a normatively binding scientific consensus presuppose a more robust  sociology than the statistical drift of scientists' allegiances. Indeed, despite  the frequently repeated claims that scientists constitute a kind of  universal polity, tight-knit guild, socially responsible institution and/or  efficient division of labour, it is striking that there is no worldwide scientific  labour union, political party or even code of ethics. Moreover, it has not been  from lack of trying. (Here we might turn to the glorious failure of John  Desmond Bernal in the UK and his slightly more successful American follower,  Barry Commoner.) In this respect, most social epistemologies of science follow  the rhetorical strategy, popularised by Popper, of depicting the normative structure of science as a successful microcosm of the regime that the philosopher would like to see govern society as a whole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">For example, Brown is  attracted to Philip Kitcher (1993), who proposed a market signalling model of  scientific authority, which presumes that scientists constitute a self-organizing  learning society from which over time patterns of expertise and trust emerge, on  the model of traders whose technical and communicative skills are mutually  honed by discovering the sorts of things that they can do best for themselves and  are best left to be done by others. From this Smithian premise supposedly  arises a rational division of cognitive labour in society. Brown appears to  believe that this basic model could work to capture the relations of authority that  science exerts both internally and externally in society. And such a model would  make good sense if scientific authority were based exclusively on scientists' technical skills, as, say, one decides who is most likely to fix the  plumbing. Successful plumbers know the limits of their skills, there is agreement  amongst plumbers about those limits and they are advertised. These facts  contribute to plumbers thriving in a classic market economy of the sort that Kitcher and Brown  admire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Science is very different. Of  course, it contains considerable technical expertise but that alone is insufficient  to account for its peculiar epistemic and moral authority. Unlike plumbers,  for better and worse, scientists as a group do <i>not</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> know the limits of their skills. They are supposed to be open to, if not  engage in, severe tests of their theories and methods, which means that on  occasion they will place themselves, their clients and perhaps even all of  society at substantial risk -- and also fail in the process. Moreover, scientists  with the same technical skills disagree profoundly over the bounds of their  epistemic and moral authority, which helps to account for the vastly different socio-political contexts in which similarly trained scientists have  comfortably operated. Indeed, no history of science would be complete without  acknowledging the various ways in which scientists have reshaped the life-world to  expand the applicability of their expertise. (Here one might trace the protean  history of the use of cost-benefit analysis in court cases such as <i>Daubert</i></span><span lang="EN-GB">.) However solidarity and trust are to be  institutionalised both within the scientific community and with the larger society, it is by no  means clear what, if any, illumination market signalling can provide (cf.  Mirowski 2004).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Brown's most sustained  treatment of the problems surrounding science's epistemic and moral authority pertain to  the compatibility of science and religion, most of which occurs in chapter  six. Here he notices that scientific and religious authorities in the US  often clash in epistemic matters subject to scarcity, such as classroom time and  textbook space (e.g. evolution v. creation) and research funding (e.g. stem cell research). Following Max Weber's sociology, Brown argues that these  conflicts ultimately boil down to differences in how claims to authority are legitimatised. In the Weberian jargon, science's 'mode of legitimation'  is usually 'legal-rational', religion's 'traditional', though in both cases  also sometimes 'charismatic'. In this context, Brown speaks approvingly of  Stephen Jay Gould's idea that science and religion constitute 'non-overlapping magisteria', again suggesting an implicit division of labour between the  two fields that somehow has managed to elude its practitioners, who end up  simply misfiring at each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">It never crosses Brown's mind  that these conflicts in authority might reflect the common descent of science and  religion, at least in the West. In other words, their differences may lie less in  their ultimate aims than in how they are best to be achieved. After all, if biologists treated Darwin's 'tree of life' simply as a taxonomic device, comparable to the periodic table of elements, there would be little  dispute with creationists and intelligent design theorists. Similarly, if  Christianity confined itself to pastoral matters and disavowed all the cognitive  pretensions of natural theology, then even Richard Dawkins would be able to sleep  soundly. But of course neither side really stays within such boundaries, since  both have claimed the origin and meaning of life as part of their epistemic  jurisdiction. To be sure, it does not follow that scientists and theologians must  clash on every single question relating to these big issues. It does not even  follow that a subset of the most prominent theories on either side is likely to  be shown to be true in the long term.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">There is much room for  negotiation by the two sides -- but only as long as invidious distinctions between,  say, 'how' (aka scientific) and 'why' (aka religious) questions are not part of the epistemic ground rules. For example, an historically reasonable  interpretation for why scientists seem overwhelmingly to reject supernatural  explanations is that they have domesticated the supernatural in terms of various  'realist' research programmes, which especially in the case of physics still  countenance counterintuitive forms of causation -- descendants of the  'action-at-a-distance' explanatory framework -- that would make the average theologian blush.  However, as long as the ontological weirdness of, say, string theory, parallel  universes or quantum entanglement is constrained by mathematics and experiments --  as opposed to Biblical exegesis and church services -- no one questions whether  students should be exposed to such ideas in the classroom, though their cost-effectiveness as research investments may be called into question  (Smolin 2006).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">In this respect, Brown fails  to see the exact relevance of Weber's social theory of legitimation to the science-religion dispute. What makes science more 'legal-rational' than religion is not its guiding ideas or metaphysical commitments but its <i>modus operandi</i></span><span lang="EN-GB">. Richard Dawkins may be one of  the few professional scientists who claims outright that science has falsified  most of the distinctive knowledge claims of religion, yet more circumspect  writers like Gould and Brown also presume this to be the case, which explains their  solicitous attitudes towards religious believers. However, against the backdrop of  Western history, science may be best understood as religion pursued by  technologically enhanced means (Noble 1997). Indeed, science in its most robust  'convergent realist' sense may make most sense as high-tech natural theology, in  which case religion's basic claims have been less falsified than sublimated. Thus,  when Brown reports the results of rather simple-minded surveys in which  scientists say that they do not believe in either a personal deity or a  supernatural realm, their responses should be read as indicative only of the survey's wording, which avoids a deeper and more relevant question: 'Does science  do a better job than religion at pursuing the cosmological issues  traditionally of concern to religious believers?' My guess is that a large proportion of scientists would strongly agree with this statement. If that is the  case, then it will take much more than tact and diplomacy for science to maintain  its epistemic and moral authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB"><i>Bibliography<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-GB">Brown, T.
