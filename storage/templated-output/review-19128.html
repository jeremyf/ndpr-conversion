 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Once upon a time,  empirically-informed, philosophical work on the mind was pretty straightforward. Mental  activity went on inside the head, and we were pretty sure that it, along with all the  good stuff associated with it -- consciousness, intentionality, mental representation, computation -- could be most readily understood without  having to crease our brows too much about how minds were situated vis-à-vis  bodies, or vis-à-vis environments.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">To be sure, the cognitive  sciences had renegade, pluralistic strands running through them, and particular  disciplinary itches that needed scratching. But there was a sufficiently articulated paradigm in place that at least made designing jacket covers for books  in the field relatively easy. Find a picture of a head, such as a  representation of a brain, ideally an image a bit attuned to the title or theme of the book,  and you're at least well on your way. I failed to understand this simple  point during what were politely called "ongoing discussions" over the cover of <i style="">The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences</i> a dozen years ago. "No, I'm sorry, Professor Wilson", I was informed by way of a solemn conclusion delivered by an exasperated  senior editor at the Press, someone whom I imagined had to avert his gaze in embarrassment on my behalf as he typed back curtly, "I am afraid that it has to be a head".</span></p><span lang="EN-AU"></span>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Designing jacket covers for  books in this neck of the woods is no longer so easy. Heads are not exactly out,  but they are no longer strictly required. Shaun Gallagher and Dan <span class="SpellE">Zahavi's</span> <i style="">The Phenomenological Mind</i> (2008) has a person half-way through exit mode  on its cover. Fred Adams and Ken <span class="SpellE">Aizawa's</span> <i style="">The Bounds of Cognition</i> (2008), for crying out loud, has <i style="">a cube of green cubes on the cover</i>. Not even <i style="">a thing that thinks</i>, so far as we know. Rob Rupert's stimulating book  continues down this path with quite a beautiful black and white photograph of a  grove of aspens in the wilds of Colorado plonked right on the cover. It's enough  to start me worrying that in order to understand the field that I work in, I  can no longer simply look at jacket covers.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In order to write this review  in my current state of existential confusion, I have thus had to resort to an  old trick of the trade, something I learned in grad school but like most  things so learnt, haven't had to use much since. Read. And, somewhat to my initial surprise, especially given the total absence of pictures once one gets  beyond the cover of <i style="">Cognitive Systems and the Extended Mind</i>, and the distinct dearth of bad jokes between the  sheets, I'm glad I did. Rupert's book is a good read. It is a sustained, systematic, critical examination of the idea that minds are not simply ensconced  inside heads, but extend into both bodies and the world beyond the body. As his  title suggests, Rupert is focused primarily on the latter of these, the  extended mind thesis, a thesis articulated neatly by Andy Clark and David Chalmers a  dozen years ago in a paper that, had it been a movie, would have been an  instant blockbuster, then a classic, and now be competing with Seinfeld re-runs  on cable <span class="SpellE">tv</span>.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">Cognitive Systems and the Extended Mind</span></i><span lang="EN-AU"> draws on a  series of papers published over the past ten years that have been influential, but  it is much more than the sum of these past parts. Bookended by introductory  and concluding chapters, its ten chapters fall into three constituent parts.  In Part I, Rupert defends the idea that "the relatively durable cognitive system . . . provides the most plausible line of demarcation between  what is cognitive and what is not" (p.7), using this idea to make a prima facie case for the claim that cognition is at least organism-bound. Part II concentrates on arguments for the hypothesis of extended cognition  (HEC), and why they fail, with Rupert helping himself to his conclusions from Part  I. Finally, Part III moves back from the rejection of HEC to focus on two other ways  to understand the sense in which cognition requires some kind of situated approach, what Rupert calls the <i style="">embedded view</i>, and the idea that cognition is <i style="">embodied</i>. I will concentrate on Part I in what follows, say something more briefly  about Part II, and leave Part III alone altogether. The bottom line for  Rupert: there is no reason to accept the idea of extended cognition, many perfectly  sane reasons to reject it, and the take-home lessons from considering the  seemingly less radical ideas that cognition is embedded and embodied are that what insights they contain are readily accommodated by cognitive science, traditionally conceived. Paradigm found.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">There is much to admire in  this book. It is well-structured and well-written, adopting a self-consciously  naturalistic perspective on how to understand the mind -- through our best, even if imperfect, empirical sciences in the domain of cognition. By presenting  and critiquing a number of explicit arguments for and against the specific  views that Rupert considers, <i style="">Cognitive Systems</i> advances the field. For all that, I think that the claims at the heart  of the book -- those about cognitive systems that drive the positive argument  of Part I, and those that appeal to natural kinds (ch.5), developmental systems  (ch.6), dynamical systems (ch.7), and experience (ch.8) in an attempt to  undermine arguments for HEC in the negative argument of Part II -- are mistaken.  Or, rather, insofar as they are true, they do little to capitalize on the  head start advantage that head-bound views of cognition have in virtue of the individualism pervasive in cognitive science's history.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Consider Rupert's chief pair  of arguments in Part I. The first of these appeals to an idea central to a  number of critiques of HEC, especially those developed by Adams and <span class="SpellE">Aizawa</span> over the past ten years: that there must be  a principled way to distinguish "genuinely cognitive contributions" from "merely causal" contributions to cognitive processes (p.16). The idea, in one version, is this. Everyone acknowledges that lots of  things, including lots of things outside the head, <i style="">cause</i> cognitive processes. Books, faraway rocks, and the word "Rosebud" can all cause cognitive processes, in fact, can cause certain cognitive  processes, rather than others. But not all that many things <i style="">constitute</i>  cognitive processes. And certainly not everything that causes cognitive processes constitutes cognitive processes. Indeed, one  might even think that being such a cause <i style="">precludes being such a constituent</i>, causes being, after all, distinct from  what they cause. (Following this thought suggests, to me at least, a deep  confusion in the kind of juxtaposition of cause and constituent in play that I will  not pursue here.) Thus, we need a <i style="">principle of demarcation</i> that delineates mere causes from genuine constituents  of cognition.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">There are two short but basic  questions to pose here. First: why? Second, one that I have picked up at  occasional postmodernist <span class="SpellE">seances</span>: who are "we"? Take them in reverse order. Precisely who needs this kind of principle of demarcation? Surely not practicing cognitive scientists, in part because  they seem to have gotten along perfectly well without one until now.  Philosophers? Well, not philosophers who take one of the chief lessons of the failure of  logical positivism in the philosophy of science, the collapse of the  analytic-synthetic distinction along <span class="SpellE">Quinean</span> lines in the same,  and the limitations of conceptual analysis to be a deep suspicion of the search  for such principles.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">What prompts the felt need  for this particular principle of demarcation? Here Rupert is somewhat torn, as  are other recent critics of HEC. On the one hand, questions about the "mark of the mental" (p.15) are presented simply as part of the general quest to understand the nature of the mind and cognition. On the other hand, a  principle of demarcation distinguishing mere causes from genuine constituents of cognitive processes is required <i style="">if one is to take the extended mind thesis seriously as a proposal within the  cognitive sciences</i>. For once we go extended, then there are so many more  causes to sort out from those genuine cognitive constituents. </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Successful attempts to  articulate even <i style="">a</i> mark of the mental systematize large chunks of cognitive phenomena. Big tick for Brentano here in appealing  to intentionality, and at least half-marks for those who have more recently posited some relationship to consciousness. Those successes regiment  thinking about cognition and the mind, but they do not settle more intricate  questions about those phenomena. In particular, just as they do not settle <i style="">precisely what kinds of agents have cognition and minds</i> (e.g., individuals <span class="SpellE">vs</span>  groups? biological <span class="SpellE">vs</span> artificial?), they do not  determine <i style="">the boundaries of the mind and cognition</i>. Worth keeping in mind here is that since extended cognitive systems are extensions of existing in-the-head cognitive systems, they will inherit whatever mark of the mental those systems have.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Consider what is involved in  taking <i style="">extended or non-extended</i> cognition seriously. One might think that it is just obvious that <span class="SpellE">internalists</span> must face a version of the cause-constituent demarcation problem -- not  all causes of cognitive processes are outside of the head, after all. In  fact, some may even think that this problem has been solved, or close enough,  within one or another <span class="SpellE">internalist</span> framework. Maybe. But  the solutions that are close enough, or at least on the right track are <i style="">not</i> those that give a one-word answer to questions like "What is the mark of the mental?" Rather, they are those that result from detailed empirical work that identifies <i style="">particular cognitive systems inside the head</i>, of which there are many. Things that fall outside the physical  boundaries of those systems are potential causes, and those that fall inside those  boundaries are potential constituents, of the specific cognitive processes that  those systems generate and facilitate the completion of. Precisely the same is  true of extended cognitive systems. But there is no one-size-fits-all answer appealing to mental marks or demarcation by cognitive systems that is  both empirically adequate to in-the-head cognitive science and antithetical  to HEC.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This then brings me to the  second major argument in Part I, which relies heavily on the notion of a cognitive  system. This argument is introduced in Chapter 3, and expanded in detail at the  beginning of Chapter 4. Despite rejecting the basic premise of this argument -- that  we require a systems-based principle of demarcation -- because of  scepticism about the need for <i style="">any</i> principle of demarcation here, I am on board with Rupert about the importance of <i style="">cognitive systems</i> for both empirical and conceptual work on cognition. I also concur that cognitive systems are integrated (cohesive) wholes, physically-bounded, reliable, mechanistic  in their operation, and typically or paradigmatically possessed by  body-bound organisms and perhaps other like individuals. What I don't see is how <i style="">any of this</i> determines where the boundaries of those cognitive systems are, let alone that those  boundaries always or even often fall within the physical boundaries of the  organisms that possess the corresponding cognitive capacities.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Many, many cognitive systems  do, of course, fall within the <span class="SpellE">organismic</span> envelope.  Yet this is not entailed, or even made more likely, by the nature of cognitive  systems or cognitive processing. Insofar as these have a nature, functionalists  and materialists are on the right track, as are the particular kinds of functionalists who are <span class="SpellE">computationalists</span>  about cognition. But none of this gets you to an individualistic view of  cognitive systems, and so cognition, any more than do appeals to "causal powers" (Fodor 1987: ch.2; Wilson 1995: ch.2) or to computationalism (Wilson  1995: ch.3), or to other general metaphysical or methodological notions in  play in the long-standing debate between individualists and externalists.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">One characteristic of  cognitive systems that Rupert emphasizes about which I have more doubts is <i style="">temporal  durability</i>. In the explicit argument that he labels the <i style="">Argument  from Empirical Success and Methodology, <span class="SpellE">Redux</span></i> (pp.59-60), Rupert  appeals to this notion by talking of a cognitive system's <i style="">temporal  grain</i>, arguing, somewhat indirectly, that extended systems have temporal grains that are too fine-grained: in short, extended  systems are not sufficiently durable. The argument begins:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">Premise 1</span></i><span lang="EN-AU">. A significant amount of successful research in cognitive psychology (and allied  fields) presupposes the existence of human cognitive systems of temporal grain </span><span style="font-style: italic;">δt</span><span lang="EN-AU">.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">Premise 2</span></i><span lang="EN-AU">. A causal principle of systems individuation [used by <span class="SpellE">HECers</span>] yields systems of temporal grain smaller than </span><span style="font-style: italic;">δ</span><i style=""><span  lang="EN-AU" style="font-family:Symbol;"><span style=""></span></span><span lang="EN-AU">t</span></i><span lang="EN-AU">.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">Premise 3</span></i><span lang="EN-AU">. Individuating cognitive systems such that their grain is smaller than </span><span style="font-style: italic;">δ</span><i style=""><span  lang="EN-AU" style="font-family:Symbol;"><span style=""></span></span><span lang="EN-AU">t</span></i><span lang="EN-AU"> compromises the research  successes referred to in <i style="">Premise 1</i>.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Here I have two related  worries. The first is that the explicit argument itself suggests something like a  classic mixed quantifier confusion between the plausible claim that for any  cognitive system, there is an appropriate temporal grain or durability range for  that system, with the much stronger and quite implausible claim that there is  one appropriate temporal grain or durability range for any cognitive system.  This may be merely suggestive and so best put aside, but it also draws  attention to the second problem: that the plausible reading of Premise 1 provides the  basis for a criticism of extended cognition only if Premise 3 is interpreted  in a way that presupposes that extended cognitive systems never or seldom have  "the appropriate" temporal durability. If that is true, however, then the argument is question-begging. Rupert takes the claim about the  inappropriate durability of extended cognitive systems to rest on the empirical  success of traditional cognitive science, but it is at best unclear how this appeal  could support what appears to be quite a strong and general claim about the  temporal grain of extended systems.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Andy Clark and I have  defended the view that durability is one of two primary dimensions in terms of which we  can <span class="SpellE">taxonomize</span> extended cognitive systems,  arguing that we can have what we called one-off, repeatable, and semi-permanent extended  cognitive systems (Wilson and Clark 2009). Rupert clearly rejects one-off extended cognitive systems, and maybe he is correct to do so. Perhaps our <span class="SpellE">labeling</span> here was unnecessarily provocative, for  our chief point was twofold: that just how often a cognitive system is realized,  or put to work, does not determine whether we have an extended cognitive system  rather than merely an external cause plus an internal cognitive system; and  that there has been an undue emphasis in the literature on relatively permanent  kinds of extended systems, something encouraged by talk of extended <i style="">minds</i>,  rather than extended <i style="">cognitive systems</i>. Insofar as Rupert's book shifts the focus to (or perhaps  keeps it on) cognitive systems, we head nod. But insofar as it combines that  focus with very general metaphysical and methodological appeals in order to  undermine HEC, at least I head shake.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The appeal to temporal grain,  and at least my second concern about it, thus point to a general difference  between my own view of HEC and that of many of its critics, including Rupert, that  affects my assessment of much of his book. Key notions in thinking  systematically and critically about cognition -- like cognitive system, realization,  natural kinds, dynamical systems, functionalism, materialism, consciousness, intentionality, to take concepts that play important roles in <i style="">Cognitive Systems</i> -- warrant philosophical analysis of a kind that is informed by, and in turn  informs, the cognitive sciences. Here Rupert and I agree. But I see the chief role of  such analysis, including my work on realization that Rupert discusses in  detail in Chapter 4, to be to open up possibilities for such empirical work,  either by revealing existing constraining assumptions as having dubious epistemic credentials, or by offering sufficiently general <span class="SpellE">construals</span> of these notions to support a pluralistic vision of the cognitive  sciences.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Rupert seems to think that  the philosophical work to be done at this fairly general level will  determine whether substantive views, such as HEC, are <i style="">true</i> or at least <i style="">likely to be true</i>. To his credit, Rupert identifies aspects of explanatory practice in the  cognitive sciences relevant to the assessment of the extended cognition thesis,  such as the identification of cognitive systems with durability. While no one  holds that whether this or that aspect of the cognitive sciences is  individualistic or externalist can simply be read off from the explanatory practices in  which cognitive scientists engage, the pluralism intrinsic to the version of  extended cognition that I embrace sits ill at ease with the project of either establishing or refuting HEC by considering appeals to natural kinds, developmental systems theory, dynamical systems, or consciousness.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">One final consideration in  play in debates over HEC, one neglected by Rupert, is the parallel between HEC  and the hypothesis of extended <i style="">biology</i> (HEB; see Wilson 2005). Although Rupert briefly touches on HEB in several  places (e.g., pp.79-80 on fitness; pp.113-118 on developmental systems theory  in biology), it is not clear what his global view of HEB is, or whether he  has such a view. HEB receives substantial support from emerging work in  various areas in the biological sciences, and exemplifies just the sort of  pluralism about the biological sciences that we should take more seriously when  thinking about the cognitive sciences. Yet HEB has not given rise to  philosophical resistance of the kind that partially constitutes the debate over HEC in  the cognitive sciences. I suspect that more sustained discussion of HEB and  HEC, and more generally of the biological and cognitive sciences together,  would have altered not only the kinds of arguments that Rupert provides and considers, but many of the conclusions he argues for with respect to  cognitive systems.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Finally, what about the  existential angst caused by those damned covers? Since there is nearly always method  in madness, I draw attention to the fact that two recent <span class="SpellE">defenses</span> of HEC, Andy Clark's <i style="">Supersizing the Mind</i> (OUP, 2008) and Alva <span class="SpellE">Noë's</span> <i style="">Out  of Our Heads</i> (2009) both feature what we might call exploding heads on their covers. Ah, the pattern becomes clearer now: for critics  of extended cognition, nothing to do with heads or brains, while <span class="SpellE">HECers</span> are represented by heads that go off firework-like, intimating hives of beyond-the-head activity. A final puzzle for now, given the systematic  nature of our study, which I leave as a take home exercise for the reader (with  a hat-tip to John Sutton): explain why Dan Dennett's classic <i style="">Brainstorms</i>  features three winter-clothed people and a sheep. A Beatles allusion? A wry Biblical reference? A nod to the New Zealand  branch of the Australasian Association of Philosophy?<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">References<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Adams, Fred, and Kenneth <span class="SpellE">Aizawa</span>, 2008, <i style="">The Bounds of Cognition</i>.
