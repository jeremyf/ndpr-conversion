<p class="MsoBodyText">Marjorie Grene and David Depew have combined forces to produce an episodic history of the philosophy of biology from Aristotle to the present.<span style="">  </span>As the title of this book implies, they are writing a history of the <i>philosophy</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of biology, not a history of biology.<span style="">  </span>Even so, in writing a history of the philosophy of biology, they cannot very well ignore biology.<span style="">   </span>Grene and Depew begin dealing with life itself.<span style="">  </span>Evolution, as it should, comes in only much later.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The first four chapters of their book concern the views of a half dozen of the most important scholars ranging from Aristotle and the Aristotelians to William Harvey, Descartes and Newton.<span style="">  </span>These chapters range over two thousand year--from the fourth century BC to the 17<sup>th</sup> century.<span style="">  </span>As might be expected these discussions are abbreviated but hardly superficial.<span style="">  </span>Grene and Depew have to deal not only with the writings of these men but also the highly technical secondary literature that has grown up around them.<span style="">  </span>I am afraid that most readers, excluding professional philosophers, will find the chapters on Aristotle and the Aristotelians formidable, but they are worth studying.<span style="">  </span>No one is better able to explain Aristotle and his "biology" than is Marjorie Grene.<span style="">  </span>Her introductory text on Aristotle remains in print to this day.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">One of the purposes of these early chapters is to show that the contrast between physics and biology has been around from the beginning of Western thought.<span style="">  </span>Grene and Depew note that the "subject matter of biology has something about it that is not quite the same as physics" (p. xv).<span style="">  </span>One of the challenges that Grene and Depew face is that two of the major figures whom they treat--Descartes and Newton--were far more concerned with physics than with biology.<span style="">  </span>Aristotle and Harvey were certainly "biologists."<span style="">  </span>Descartes and Newton were not.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">However, Grene and Depew do mine the literature on these two men as much as possible to discover what they had to say on what we today term "biology."<span style="">  </span>After all, Descartes was famous for treating organisms as machines.<span style="">  </span>According to Descartes, all organisms, save human beings, are nothing but machines.<span style="">  </span>In addition each of us has a mind.<span style="">  </span>For Grene and Depew, Descartes' <i>bête-machine</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is their <span style="font-style: italic;">bête </span></span><i>noire.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="">  </span>But Descartes dealt with several issues that are closer to biology, including a dispute with Harvey about the circulation of the blood.<span style="">  </span>As central to both physics and the philosophy of science as Newton certainly was, Grene and Depew treat him in only a cursory fashion because he did not contribute to biology, nor did biology influence his philosophy of science all that much.<span style="">  </span>He did, however, have an impact on the philosophy of science.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Grene and Depew have an easier time of it when they turn to the 18<sup>th</sup> century.<span style="">  </span>Linnaeus, Buffon, Lamarck, Geoffroy St.-Hilaire and Cuvier were biologists, primarily systematists, natural historians and comparative anatomists. This was the pinnacle of French science, Linnaeus notwithstanding.<span style="">  </span>Grene and Depew detail the rivalries, first between Linnaeus and Buffon and then between Geoffroy St.-Hilaire and Cuvier.<span style="">  </span>Lamarck seemed to find himself in opposition to just about everyone.<span style="">  </span>In these battles, Linnaeus and Cuvier won.<span style="">  </span>We are lucky that so much really excellent work has been done on these biologists.<span style="">  </span>The secondary literature is both extensive and comprehensible.<span style="">  </span>For example, even though Linnaeus was considered a creationist by both his contemporaries and subsequent scholars, it turns out that in his later works he introduced a theory of transmutation.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Grene and Depew devote an entire chapter to Kant even though they admit that he did not discuss biology all that extensively.<span style="">  </span>His views were simply too influential in Germany to ignore. To my surprise Kant turns out to have a lot more to say about living creatures than I had thought.<span style="">  </span>The most fundamental philosophical issues were teleology and natural purpose, but Kant also found himself embroiled in the monogenism-polygenism dispute.<span style="">  </span>Did the various races of human beings belong in one species or several? </p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Kant opposed polygenism and supported his position by reference to Buffon's species concept.<span style="">  </span>The contrast is between species as eternal forms defined in terms of essential characteristics (perhaps clusters) or as historical entities maintained by successive breeding (p. 80).<span style="">  </span>Are species kinds (<i>Arten</i><span style="font-style: normal;">), lineages (</span><i>Gattungen</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) or both (p. 118)?<span style="">  </span>Life would be easier if these two species concepts always divided up the living world in the same way, but they don't.<span style="">  </span>Because miscegenation was far from unknown at the time, Kant concluded that all human beings belong to a single species.<span style="">  </span>In the following century, a temporal dimension was added to this dispute.<span style="">  </span>One species might split into two or more species, and a single species might have its origin in two or more species. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">As always Darwin provides the watershed for biology.<span style="">  </span>Geology was the chief impetus.<span style="">  </span>In addition, British scientists took it on themselves to develop philosophy of science as a professional discipline, just in time to be confronted by a theory that seriously challenged their philosophies.<span style="">  </span>John Herschel and William Whewell were the founding fathers of philosophy of science in Great Britain, and in the case of Whewell at least biology played a role.<span style="">  </span>For some reason, Grene and Depew do not discuss John Stuart Mill at any length, possibly because he came along later.<span style="">  </span>What is disturbing is that all three of these men-- the very men who devoted a good part of their professional lives studying science as science--rejected Darwin's theory.<span style="">  </span>Species do not evolve, and if they do, they certainly do not do so by means of natural selection--the law of higgledy piggledy. </p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">After the chapter on Darwin, Grene and Depew proceed along a familiar path beginning with the "non-rediscovery" of Mendel's laws at the turn of the century.<span style="">  </span>In the early years scientists tended to refer to the "discovery" of Mendel's laws, but historians were put off.<span style="">  </span>Mendel discovered these laws.<span style="">  </span>At the turn of the century, they were "rediscovered."<span style="">  </span>Then later as historians dug more deeply into the literature, they decided that their predecessors had seriously misunderstood Mendel, reading present-day concerns into his work.<span style="">  </span>Mendel was no Mendelian.<span style="">  </span>Hence, the early "rediscovers" of Mendel's laws were actually "non-rediscoverers."<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Grene and Depew move along familiar ground as they discuss the work of such biologists as Hugo de Vries, Francis Galton, William Bateson, Karl Pearson and W. F. R. Weldon.<span style="">  </span>From there they proceed to the rise of the Modern Synthesis attributed to R. A. Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, Sewall Wright and to a lesser degree Julian Huxley.<span style="">  </span>The next stage in this "synthesis" was produced by Theodosius Dobzhansky, Ernst Mayr, G. G. Simpson and G. Ledyard Stebbins.<span style="">  </span>In the second half of this chapter, Grene and Depew give the critics of the Modern Synthesis their say Ð starting with Richard Goldschmidt, but then moving quickly to more recent developments, in particular the works of Wynne Edwards, G. C. Williams, W. D. Hamilton, Dick Lewontin, Steve Gould, Niles Eldredge, E. O. Wilson, Richard Dawkins, and David Sloan Wilson.<span style="">  </span>Some of these biologists viewed themselves as opposing traditional versions of evolutionary theory while others thought of themselves as improving upon them.<span style="">  </span>I personally see little rhyme or reason to which alternative a particular biologist adopted.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In the penultimate chapter Grene and Depew turn to the contributions made to these controversies by philosophers of biology.<span style="">  </span>Of course, distinguishing between philosophers, scientists and philosophers of science as I have in this review begs for a deconstructionist diatribe.<span style="">  </span>Was Aristotle a philosopher?<span style="">  </span>How about a biologist?<span style="">  </span>Of course these terms were not coined in English until much later.<span style="">  </span>After all Aristotle spoke ancient Greek, not present-day English.<span style="">  </span>But did Aristotle engage in activities similar to those that at least tax some present-day biologists?<span style="">  </span>The answer is yes.<span style="">  </span>If Aristotle is not a biologist, then neither are these present-day scientists.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in;">The contrast between philosophers and scientists is even harder to draw.<span style="">  </span>For example, most people today think of Descartes as a philosopher and Newton as a scientist because of the very different fates that their work received, but in their day Descartes and Newton were engaged in much the same array of activities.<span style="">  </span>Present-day philosophy of biology and biology merge seamlessly.<span style="">  </span>Both philosophers and biologists contribute to this endeavor.<span style="">  </span>In this penultimate chapter of their book, Grene and Depew evaluate the contributions made by biologists and philosophers of biology to such issues as the species problem, reducibility, function and teleology--issues that have been debated in some form or other from Aristotle to the present.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In the final chapter, Grene and Depew address a grab bag of topics that are not all that related to the book as a whole--the descent of man, polygenism and monogenism once again, the nature/nurture controversy, brains, language, mind and the human genome project.<span style="">  </span>Because of my own interests, I might be excused for treating one issue in my own work that Grene and Depew discuss--the metaphysical status of species as the things that evolve.<span style="">  </span>A fairly standard distinction in philosophy from at least Plato and Aristotle to the present is between classes and individuals.<span style="">  </span>The terms change, but the distinction remains fairly constant.<span style="">  </span>Classes are groups or sets of entities.<span style="">  </span>All the planets in the universe form a class.<span style="">  </span>A subset of these classes is important because they function in laws of nature -- at least for those philosophers who think that such things as laws of nature exist.<span style="">  </span>Even though the universe is finite, laws of nature are commonly characterized as being spatiotemporally unrestricted.<span style="">  </span>Hence, the classes that function in them must also be spatiotemporally unrestricted.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Individuals are quite another kettle of fish.<span style="">  </span>They are spatiotemporally restricted.<span style="">  </span>They come into existence and pass away.<span style="">  </span>For example, Mars is an individual planet.<span style="">  </span>Just as ordinary language includes the names of numerous classes that are of no interest to scientists, ordinary people identify all sorts of different individuals, most of which are also of no interest to scientists. The universe is full of individuals, but a subset of these individuals is especially important because laws of nature range over them.<span style="">  </span>According to most philosophers throughout the history of philosophy, natural individuals and natural kinds are quite different things.<span style="">  </span>At the very east, one is spatiotemporally restricted, while the other is spatiotemporally unrestricted.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In the 1970s Michael Ghiselin and I thought that we had stumbled upon something new.<span style="">  </span>Even though biological species had been commonly treated as paradigm classes throughout the history of Western thought, they have almost none of the attributes that characterize classes and nearly all of the attributes that characterize individuals--that is, if species evolve the way that most evolutionary biologists think that they do.<span style="">  </span>In a sense, Ghiselin and I were not suggesting anything all that radical.<span style="">  </span>We were not introducing any drastic changes in the traditional distinction between classes and individuals.<span style="">  </span>We were merely urging that we move species from one metaphysical category to another--from class to individual.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Admitting that we had gotten one of our examples wrong does not seem to be such a momentous affair, but numerous philosophers and some biologists were disturbed.<span style="">  </span>Grene was especially irate.<span style="">  </span>In order to avoid treating species as individuals, she is willing to modify the traditional distinction between classes and individuals.<span style="">  </span>Why not countenance classes that are temporally restricted?<span style="">  </span>If all the planets in the universe form a class, why not all the terrestrial planets?<span style="">  </span>The answer is that the former is a candidate to function in laws of nature, while the latter is not. <span style=""> </span>Grene also admits that on her suggested interpretation, individual organisms now become classes.<span style="">  </span>Just as species are made up of classes of organisms, individual organisms are made up of classes of cells (p. 300).<span style="">  </span>Fido is a class!<span style="">  </span>We might even discover the law of Fido. </p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Why go to such lengths just to retain a commonsense notion of species as classes, possibly natural kinds?<span style="">  </span>One answer is that lots of people, including Grene, want to be able to look into their garden and see a robin redbreast.<span style="">  </span>They are not about to engage in all the empirical research necessary to discover the place of this robin in its genealogical nexus.<span style="">  </span>I agree that finding out what one needs to know in order to determine what is or is not an evolutionary species is not easy.<span style="">  </span>Still, I think that evolutionary biologists, if they are to understand the evolutionary process, must do just that.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Grene also thinks that I reject appeals to "properties, which are typological, and so wicked" (p. 301).<span style="">  </span>To the contrary, properties play a central role in my view of the evolutionary process. Where we differ is that on my view genealogy is primary while properties are secondary.<span style="">  </span>Secondary may not have the pride of place as primary, but it is not nothing.<span style="">  </span>In addition, I have nothing against typology as long as it is properly applied.<span style="">  </span>Treating particular species typologically is a mistake, but there are many things in the biological world that warrant being treated typologically, the species category itself perhaps.<span style="">  </span>How wicked these views may be, I cannot say.<span style="">   </span></p>   A second reason why so many people are so conservative with respect to species is that we human beings form a species.<span style="">  </span>If something is true of all species, then it is true of our species, and lots of people do not want to visualize the human species as part of a genealogical network.<span style="">  </span>According to the class interpretation, a certain list of characters defines <i>Homo sapiens</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Anyone who lacks one or more of these characters is either not a human being or not a normal human being.<span style="">  </span>On the part-whole interpretation, a newborn baby born without plantigrade feet is still a human being.<span style="">  </span>If your parents are human beings, then you are a human being.<span style="">  </span>If you mate successfully with another human being, then you too are a human being.<span style="">  </span></span><i>Homo sapiens</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, like all sexual species, is part of a particular genealogical nexus.<span style="">  </span>That may not sound right, but there it is.<span style="">  </span>Although Buffon did not think that species evolve in the modern sense of this term, he did view species as genealogical units.<span style="">  </span>Since Ghiselin and I first published, we have discovered a long list of scholars who thought that species are better treated as individuals than as classes.</span>
