<p class="MsoBodyText">The first Symposium Aristotelicum met at Oxford in 1967, and has met every three years since then, once in the United States, but usually on the other side of the Atlantic.<span style="">  </span>Its principal founders were Ingemar Düring, a philologist with an interest in philosophical texts, and G. E. L. Owen, later a professor of ancient philosophy at Oxford, Harvard, and Cambridge, certainly the most influential figure in his field during the last half of the twentieth century in the English-speaking world and perhaps in the whole world.<span style="">  </span>Although the Symposium has seen some changes, its basic structure has remained importantly the same: a small self-perpetuating group of organizers, referred to by participants with a mixture of irony and resentment as the Nocturnal Council, who settle on a topic, determine speakers, and invite some other attendees, roughly a total of thirty people.<span style="">  </span>Papers are distributed in advance to allow for extended discussion, and then revised for publication.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">One of the notable changes in the Symposium has been its gravitation toward the Anglo-American sphere of influence.<span style="">  </span>In the first six Symposia, less than a third of the papers were given by speakers from North America or the United Kingdom, whereas eight of the twelve contributors to the present volume reside in one of those two places, six of them in Cambridge (England), Oxford, or Princeton.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, all papers in the last three published proceedings have been in English (I believe this is a requirement of the Clarendon Press), whereas in the first six well less than half were.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">I want to mention one other change in the format of the Symposium.<span style="">  </span>The first Symposia had relatively broad topics, "Aristotle and Plato in the mid-fourth century," "Aristote et les problèmes de méthode," "Aristotle on dialectic: the <i>Topics</i><span style="font-style: normal;">," "Naturphilosophie bei Aristoteles und Theophrast." In the last five (including the one for 2005), the subject has been either a short treatise or one book of a treatise.<span style="">  </span>Book 1 of </span><i>On Generation and Corruption</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (</span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) is the longest of the five texts chosen, 26 pages in the standard collected works of Aristotle in English.<span style="">  </span>For the most part speakers are assigned a given stretch of text, usually a chapter.<span style="">  </span>Obviously the demand is for a close reading of the text or, at least, the most interesting parts of it, but the goal is not to produce a commentary, but rather a series of interpretive essays setting out what prominent individual scholars can make of (very difficult) material assigned to them.<span style="">  </span>The results will be of great interest to scholars and graduate students working on ancient natural science and philosophy.<span style="">  </span>A review written for them would necessarily be overlong and excruciatingly detailed, and unlikely to affect their independent judgments of the volume.<span style="">  </span>This review is aimed at a somewhat more general philosophical audience, and will mention only some of the major claims made in the essays.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In the Aristotelian corpus with which we work <i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> comes after the </span><i>Physics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>On the Heavens</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and precedes the </span><i>Meteorology</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, the psychological works, and the biological works.<span style="">  </span>In the </span><i>Physics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> Aristotle discusses the principles of the study of nature, causation, change, infinity, space, time, and vacuum, and concludes with an argument that there is an unmoved first mover of the universe.<span style="">  </span>The first two books of </span><i>On the Heavens</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> are devoted to the world above the moon, the remaining two to the natural motions of the four simple bodies, earth, water, air, and fire.<span style="">  </span>In the second book of </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> Aristotle discusses qualitative aspects of the simple bodies, treating each of them as involving "a certain matter which is not separate but always with a contrariety" (329a24-26) and a pair of contraries, one from the pair wet and dry, the other from the pair hot and cold.<span style="">  </span>He describes the change of one simple body into another as a matter of the change of one of its contraries into its contrary, e.g., of wet into dry; these simple bodies are the components of everything from which other things are generated and into which they are destroyed.<span style="">  </span>In the last three chapters of </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> Aristotle says that this generation and destruction of things is ultimately due to the motion of the sun in the ecliptic.<span style="">  </span>In the first three books of the </span><i>Meteorology</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, Aristotle discusses phenomena which he considers to be sublunar, including comets, rain, and earthquakes.<span style="">  </span>In the last book he takes up the processes involved in the formation and development of bodies such as oil, gold, wood, wine, and flesh; the four simple bodies and the basic contraries are fundamental to this discussion, but the contraries function much more like basic material stuffs than like the mere properties they appear to be in </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 2.<span style="">  </span>The introduction of soul in the psychological works provides Aristotle with the basis for distinguishing living things from others and discussing such topics as nutrition and growth, perception, and thought.<span style="">  </span>In the biological works Aristotle concerns himself with various kinds of animals, their parts, the mechanics of their motion, and their reproduction.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It can be seen that there is a general pattern to this sequence: a discussion of general principles in the <i>Physics</i><span style="font-style: normal;">; a treatment of the superlunar realm, which changes only by moving; a treatment of the simple bodies in terms of their movements; then </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1; then a treatment of the simple bodies in terms of their basic qualities and an explanation of the coming to be of things; then a discussion of sublunar phenomena not involving life; then an account of the interaction of the simple bodies; then an account of life and its fundamental distinguishing features; then a detailed account of the nature and development of particular living things.<span style="">  </span>Roughly, then, the sequence is: most general principles of nature; highest, barely natural domain; natural domain treated in its least concrete aspect, motion; </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1; most basic components of the sublunar realm; phenomena of the lifeless sublunar realm; most basic features of life; detailed discussion of living things.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">How, then, does <i>GC </i><span style="font-style: normal;">1 fit into this scheme?<span style="">  </span>I would respond, echoing the title ("Aristotle on the Foundations of Sublunary Physics") of Myles Burnyeat's introduction to this volume, that </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is a presentation of the general principles for studying the features of the sublunar world, other than those brought out in the treatment of the motion of the simple bodies in </span><i>On the Heavens </i><span style="font-style: normal;">1 and 2.<span style="">  </span>To make this characterization more concrete I indicate the topics of the chapters of </span><i>GC </i><span style="font-style: normal;">1 before making a few remarks about the way they are treated in the current volume.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">At the beginning of 1.1 Aristotle gives a very general description of his topic, the explanation of natural coming to be, and then (314a3-5) a more specific one: the definitions of change of size (growth) and of change of quality (alteration),<span style="">  </span>and the question whether change of quality is different from generation, roughly speaking the question whether a thing's coming to exist is a matter of something's changing its characteristics.<span style="">  </span>It seems fair to say that for Aristotle the distinction between generation and other changes, including alteration, is the distinction between something acquiring a new 'form' and hence becoming a new thing and something remaining the same thing while changing, say, its color or size or position (cp. 317a23-27).<span style="">  </span>Chapters 1 and 2 are typical Aristotelian discussions of his predecessors.<span style="">  </span>In 1.1 (discussed by Jacques Brunschwig) he rejects the views of both the monists because they must treat generation as alteration and the pluralists, particularly Empedocles, who, he says, is obligated to distinguish generation and alteration, but, in fact says the opposite and even contradicts himself.<span style="">  </span>In 1.2 (discussed by David Sedley) Aristotle rules out the idea that generation is the combination of particles by attacking the very idea of atomism.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Chapters 3-5 carry out the program set out at the beginning of 1.1.<span style="">  </span>In 1.4 (discussed by Sarah Broadie) Aristotle characterizes alteration as occurring "when a substratum which is perceptible remains but changes in its affections (these being either opposites or intermediates); for example, a body is healthy and then sick while remaining the same, and a round bronze thing is at some time round angular, but it is the same" (319b10-12), but his main concern is with the question of the difference between alteration and generation.<span style="">  </span>This question cannot be treated separately from the issue of 1.3 (discussed by Keimpe Algra): is there any such thing as generation?<span style="">  </span>Aristotle's answer to this question is affirmative, but Aristotle's explanation of his answer is inscrutably torturous.<span style="">  </span>Both Broadie and Algra focus on the issue of prime matter (traditionally the "matter which is not separate") and its (possible) place in Aristotle's ontology, as does David Charles in a separate chapter on simple generation and prime matter. Finally in 1.5 (discussed by Alan Code) Aristotle treats growth, focusing on the case of an animal's growing as a result of taking in food, and stressing that this growth is not a case of adding bits of matter here and there; rather the subject of growth is the animal as a whole and its form. The focus on animal growth is one indication of the difficulty of my characterization of the general program of Aristotle's writings on nature.<span style="">  </span>One would expect a more general account of growth than Aristotle gives, including, say, the expansion of water when it freezes.<span style="">  </span>Equally puzzling perhaps is that in <i>On the Soul</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 2.4 the soul is said to feed the body with food, but there is no mention of the soul in </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1.5.<span style="">  </span>Perhaps we can say that, despite the obvious focus of the chapter on the growth of living things and its invocation of form, Aristotle is still abstracting from the fundamental role of the factor which makes them living things and hence capable of growing, that is, soul. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">At the beginning of chapter 1.6 (discussed by Carlo Natali) Aristotle describes what is to come. He looks ahead to the discussion of <i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 2.1-4, and then says that it is necessary to first speak about certain things which have only been described (presumably by others) in an indeterminate way:</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">For all those who generate the elements <i.e.,><span style="">  </span>as well as those who generate the bodies that are compounded of the elements make use of dissociation and association, and of action and being acted on (passion). </p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Action and passion are the topic of chapters<i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">7, 8, and 9 (discussed by Christian Wildberg, Edward Hussey, and Michel Crubellier respectively).<span style="">  </span>To explain the reason for discussing mixture, the topic of </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1.10 (discussed by Dorothea Frede, with an additional essay on mixture by John Cooper) Aristotle says simply: </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Now association is mixture, but the meaning of mixture has not been clearly explained. </p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Finally he explains the need for the discussion of contact (<i>aph</i><span style="font-style: normal;">ê), which forms the rest of </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1.6: </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">But if we must investigate action and passion and mixture, we must also investigate contact. For things which cannot be in contact with one another cannot act or suffer, nor can things mix unless they have first been in contact in some way.<span style="">   </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">I shall not discuss the essays on chapters 5 to 9 further, except to say that I found the essay on 5 more than usually cogent and insightful and the essay on 8 extremely useful for its analysis of the chapter and of the way the chapter fits with other Aristotelian material.<span style="">   </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The essays on chapters 1 and 2 make use of philological maneuvers to extricate Aristotle from charges of intellectual chicanery.<span style="">  </span>Brunschwig suggests not only that Aristotle has given an implausible account of Empedocles as someone who must say something, but, in fact says the opposite, and also contradicts himself, but also that Aristotle found the account unsatisfactory and gave up on it (in some sense which is not entirely clear to me), so that 1.2 is the "real" begining of <i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Sedley addresses the issue of the extent to which the argument or arguments for atomism which Aristotle presents are his own creation.<span style="">  </span>He argues that if five lines, 316b9-14, which contain the Aristotelian term 'potentially' are moved 14 lines further back, one can distinguish between a Democritean formulation of the argument, which Aristotle rejects, and Aristotle's attempt to give Democritus a better shot at his target, a shot which Aristotle also turns away.<span style="">  </span>No doubt different scholars will react differently to these attempts to keep our image of Aristotle polished.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">According to what is called the traditional view, Aristotle did believe in prime matter, but, as one author puts it,"today the politically correct view appears to be that there is no such thing as prime matter in Aristotle at all" (91).<span style="">  </span>Most of the contributors to the volume successfully avoid the issue of prime matter, but I noticed only one person who states any doubts about the rejection of the tradition (40-42), as against four who do reject it explicitly.<span style="">  </span>Aristotle has no need to invoke prime matter to account for any change except possibly for the change of one simple body into another, of which I have already given a (politically incorrect) characterization.<span style="">  </span>It is not my intention to defend that characterization, but only to claim that a discussion of prime matter ought to start with an account of <i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 2.1-4 and determine the place of that account in Aristotle's writings on nature and, in particular, its relationship not only to </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1, but also to </span><i>Physics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1.7-8, where Aristotle appears to say that every change involves a substratum and a pair of contraries, and </span><i>Meteorology</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 4, where, as I have suggested, Aristotle's treatment of the simple bodies and basic contraries has a quite different odor from </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 2.1-4.<span style="">  </span>Of the opponents of the traditional conception of prime matter in the present volume Broadie says that </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1.4 "presents a different and more developed picture of change than <</span><i>Physics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1.7-8>," (129) and finds it difficult to believe that if at the time of writing the </span><i>Physics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> chapters he had a definite view about a distinct structure of generation he would not have expressed it (130).<span style="">  </span>She offers an elaborate defence of the view that the transformation of simple bodies is a matter of one substratum being substituted for another. On the other hand, Algra, who appears to hold a similar view of simple-body transformation but stresses that he is only talking about </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1.3 (94), claims that it and </span><i>Physics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1.8 are not inconsistent because they represent "different levels of analysis" (117).<span style="">  </span>Frede argues that the simple bodies are nothing more than a pair of qualities "with no underlying matter" and that "'prime matter' is nothing but the </span><i>potential</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of the simple bodies to engage in different basic combinations" (304; Frede's italics).<span style="">  </span>Finally Charles, who offers reasons for rejecting Broadie's position (168), develops a global alternative account of prime matter, according to which it is an abstract or logical entity, not a material one.<span style="">  </span>I do not think this account is plausible, but it brings to the fore the broad range of interpretation to which some Aristotelian doctrines or alleged doctrines can be subject.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">I want to conclude this review by a considering the alternative accounts of mixture put forward by Frede and Cooper, and then making a more general remark.<span style="">  </span>Mixtures in the relevant sense are so-called homoiomerous compounds of the simple bodies, such as flesh and blood, which are for Aristotle infinitely divisible and which are such that any part is "like" the whole.<span style="">  </span>Frede defends a standard account of Aristotle's picture of mixture in <i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1.10, according to which, when the simple bodies mix (as opposed to transform into one another), their qualities somehow combine to form new qualities making up a new homoiomerous material.<span style="">  </span>According to the traditional view, apparently accepted by Frede, every piece of a homoiomery, such as flesh, is not only qualitatively like every other, it is also materially the same: it is flesh.<span style="">  </span>Cooper concedes that Aristotle may be committed to this view in </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> II.8, but insists that on the most plausible reading of 1.10 Aristotle denies the material uniformity of homoiomeries.<span style="">  </span>Personally, I think the standard view is right here.<span style="">  </span>Aristotle never says or implies in 1.10 -- nor should he -- that in mixtures of the simple bodies, "the ingredients come to be altered in their perceptible properties (while </span><i>somehow</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> retaining their identities as distinct ingredients)"<span style="">  </span>(321; my italics).<span style="">  </span>All Aristotle is committed to in 1.10 is that when a homoiomery is dissolved the simple bodies can emerge in the same amounts as when they started to mix; he does not say, and, I think, should not say, that the </span><i>identical</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> simple bodies can be recovered.<span style="">   </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">On the other hand, I think that on the most plausible reading of <i>Meteorology</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 4, the descriptions of processes that Aristotle offers entail that homoiomeries are not homoiomerous in the material sense (and perhaps not in the qualitative sense either).<span style="">  </span>Here I disagree with Frede's claim (312) that there is no "real incompatibility" between </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and the </span><i>Meteorology</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>I cannot discuss question of compatibility in this review, but I do want to point to the broader question raised here and elsewhere in this review concerning the place of </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> in the general scheme of Aristotle's physical writings.<span style="">  </span>In his introduction Burnyeat represents the </span><i>Physics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as providing the conceptual foundation for all the physical writings and, as I have indicated, </span><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as providing the conceptual foundations for the study of the sublunar world. On the relation between these two works Burnyeat says: "The puzzle is that the concepts under discussion <in><i>GC</i><span style="font-style: normal;">> are ones we are supposed to be familiar with from our reading of the </span><i>Physics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> . . . It is as if we had to retrace our steps and problematize concepts we thought we had learned.<span style="">  </span>But it is important to appreciate that Aristotle's aim is not just to problematize these concepts.<span style="">  </span>They are to be </span><i>shaped</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> for the specifically Aristotelian theoretical use to which they will be put throughout the physical works, up to </span><i>On the Soul</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and beyond" (16; Burnyeat's italics).<span style="">  </span>The same, I think, can be said about the relationship of </span><i>GC </i><span style="font-style: normal;">to the subsequent physical works.<span style="">  </span>But the question that has to be asked is 'What is involved in shaping?'<span style="">  </span>We have seen in connection with this volume that even questions of consistency can be raised about Aristotle's treatment or use of the same concepts in different passages.<span style="">  </span>The detailed study of, say, a chapter written by Aristotle no doubt contributes to determining that text's relationship to its broader context and the whole corpus.<span style="">  </span>But I am inclined to think that we will not make real progress toward understanding relationships of this kind until we have a generally accepted notion of what it is for Aristotle to reshape a concept already explained for other specific theoretical uses. </span></p>
