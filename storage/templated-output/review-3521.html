<p class="MsoBodyText">It is now a full century since the publication of "On Denoting", the essay in which Bertrand Russell introduced the theory of descriptions.<span style="">  </span>The current volume, released just in time for the centenary, shows unequivocally that Russell's analysis remains central to philosophy of language and linguistic semantics: the contributors are all major figures, the quality of the essays is quite high overall, and each essay addresses areas of current research.<span style="">  </span>While many of the nineteen chapters explore various consequences of Russell's approach, developing it in novel ways and defending it against various criticisms (some new, some of long standing), others explore alternative treatments.<span style="">  </span>In addition, some essays consider the application of Russell's theory to phenomena Russell himself never addressed -- for example, so-called pronominal descriptions and anaphoric pronouns.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Significance<o:p></o:p></b></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Quite independently of the volume under review, a glance at the recent literature reveals that interest in the theory of descriptions is as strong as ever.<span style="">  </span>This might seem curious to non-specialists; indeed, it's bound occasionally even to puzzle some working in the area.<span style="">  </span>Why, it might be asked, is the proper treatment of sentences of the form (T) 'the F is G' of such signal importance?<span style="">  </span>In answering, it should be said that conveying the importance of the theory of descriptions is best accomplished by considering a question that arises in the volume: whether descriptions are, as Russell thought, devices of quantification, and thus should be grouped together with <i>all</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>some</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>no</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, or whether, as Frege thought, they are singular terms, and thus should be grouped together with proper names and pronouns.<span style="">  </span>A quantified sentence such as 'some boys play chess' is true just in case the intersection of the set of boys and the set of chess players is non-empty; in contrast, a singular-term-containing sentence such as 'Nicholas plays chess' is true just in case Nicholas is in the set of chess players.<span style="">  </span>The former expresses an </span><i>object-neutral</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> proposition: in specifying its truth conditions we make no reference to a particular individual or set of individuals.<span style="">  </span>In contrast, the latter expresses a singular, or </span><i>object-dependent</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, proposition: in specifying its truth conditions we must refer to a particular individual.<span style="">  </span></span><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style=""> </span>On Russell's analysis, a sentence exemplifying (T) expresses an object-neutral proposition.<span style="">  </span>The analysis is notoriously unfaithful to surface grammar: for Russell, its logical form is captured by the conjunction: something is F, at most one thing is F, and every F is G.<span style="">  </span>(A similar analysis applies to possessive variants of (T), such as 'her F is G.')<span style="">   </span>Peter Strawson's classic essay "On Referring"<a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a> argued that this departure from surface grammar gets things exactly wrong: the "rules of use" associated with a sentence exemplifying (T) require that there exists a contextually identifiable F -- something which is both F and which the speaker can be taken to be singling out.<span style="">  </span>In uttering 'the king of France is bald,' for example, the speaker presupposes, and does not assert, that there is such an F.<span style="">  </span>What the speaker does do -- if the presupposition holds -- is to refer to an entity.<span style="">  </span>This is borne out by that fact that, were the speaker (presumably in the dark about France's current form of government) to ask 'is the king of France bald?' he would not be responded to with a flat <i>no</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Rather, his presupposition would be addressed: he would be advised that France is no longer a monarchy. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">One apparent advantage of Strawson's picture is its fidelity to surface grammar.<span style="">  </span>But this remains an advantage only so long as there are independent reasons to think, with Frege, that definite descriptions are semantical singular terms.<span style="">  </span>Since at least the mid-1970's, linguists have taken descriptions to be quantified noun phrases.<span style="">  </span>More specifically, the definite and indefinite articles have been assimilated into the class of determiners -- items, such as <i>every</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>some</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>no</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>most</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, that combine with a nominal to form a quantified noun phrase.<span style="">  </span>This line of research inspired those working in philosophical logic and linguistic semantics to construct formal languages containing expressions resembling natural language quantifiers in possessing nominal restrictions.<span style="">  </span>Such a framework not only provided the resources to represent definite descriptions as quantifiers, it did so in a way that captured the truth conditional core of Russell's theory.<a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a><span style="">  </span>Of course, even if the</span><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">definite article is a determiner from the point of view of formal syntax, this doesn't in itself settle any questions about the logical form of sentences exemplifying (T) -- as Russell taught us, grammar may mislead with respect to logical form.<a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a><span style="">  </span>Nonetheless, it is now Strawson, and not Russell, who is in the awkward position.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The Russell-Strawson debate concerns a cluster of related issues: logical form and its relation to grammatical form, the difference between object-neutral and object-dependent propositions, the nature and semantic significance of speaker presupposition, the difference between referring to and quantifying over an entity or entities.<span style="">  </span>Evaluating Russell's theory involves taking a stand on these central issues.<span style="">  </span>In addition, taking a stand on one question involves taking (at least provisionally) a stand on the others.<span style="">  </span>Why, then, is the proper treatment of the definite article a continuing object of fascination?<span style="">  </span>Because it will provide an answer to a cluster of fundamental questions in the philosophy of language.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In fact, this list barely scratches the surface.<span style="">  </span>Since Keith Donnellan's essay "Reference and Definite Descriptions"<a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a> was published, providing the proper treatment of the definite article involves taking a stand on the effect context has on semantic content and, consequently, on where to draw the boundary dividing semantics (roughly, the study of the context-invariant meanings linguistic expressions have) and pragmatics (roughly, the study of the general, language-independent principles guiding the use of linguistic expressions).<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The following sections discuss four themes that arise in the volume:<span style="">  </span>the problem of incompleteness, the referential-attributive distinction, presupposition, and the attempt to provide a unified approach to definite and indefinite descriptions.<span style="">  </span>Space considerations force me to discuss of the first two themes (which are in any case intimately related) in a single section and to set aside discussion of indefinite descriptions and unbound anaphora (section V) and descriptive names (section VI).<a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Incompleteness and the Referential-Attributive Distinction<o:p></o:p></b></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Donnellan observed that there are two uses to which an utterance exemplifying (T) can be put: it can be used to assert that there is something both uniquely F and G, or it can be used to assert, about a contextually definite individual <b><i>o</i></b><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">, that </span><b><i>o</i></b><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"> is G.<span style="">  </span>For example, one can use 'Smith's murderer is insane' to assert that whoever is uniquely responsible for Smith's death is insane.<span style="">  </span>But one can also use this sentence to assert, of a given woman, that </span><i>she </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is insane (e.g., a woman, seen at court, whom I wrongly believe murdered Smith and whose behavior is erratic).<span style="">  </span>While some have taken Donnellan's distinction to provide a serious challenge to Russell, others have denied that it has any direct implications for a Russellian approach.<span style="">  </span>For example, Paul Grice and Saul Kripke early on argued that the distinction in itself admits of a pragmatic explanation.<a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a> Indeed, Kripke claimed that even in a language in which the definite article is, by stipulation, purely quantificational (so-called Russell English), referential use would nonetheless supervene.<span style="">  </span>These considerations were given definitive treatment in Stephen Neale's landmark </span><i>Descriptions</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Neale observed that, although (1) is quantificational, one can use it to refer to an individual:</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">1. Everyone attending my seminar showed up.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Context: </i><span style="font-style: normal;">Smith and I know that Jones is the only student attending Smith's seminar; I ask how Smith's party went last night; Smith responds by uttering (1), thereby conveying the object-dependent proposition that Jones showed up at his party.<span style="">  </span>Obviously, we could, perversely, complicate the semantics of </span><i>everyone</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> so that, on some uses, it is semantically referential.<span style="">  </span>But this would run afoul of a sound methodological principle, first articulated by Grice: "Do not multiply senses beyond necessity."<span style="">  </span>Grice's principle ("Modified Occam's Razor") cautions against positing ambiguities where appeals to general conversational heuristics are equally explanatorily effective.<span style="">  </span>And these conversational heuristics, as articulated by Grice, provide an effective explanation of how Smith managed to convey a proposition about Jones in uttering (1).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">As Grice makes clear, considerations favoring the view that the referential use of definite descriptions is semantically significant equally support the absurd claim that the referential use of <i>everyone</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is semantically significant.<span style="">  </span>The moral: better to avoid complicating the semantics of </span><i>the</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, than either to endorse an absurd hypothesis or arbitrarily treat similar contexts differently.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In his contribution, "The Case for Referential Descriptions", Michael Devitt develops a powerful argument against the Grice-Russell orthodoxy.<span style="">  </span>(The discussion of Devitt's argument in the separate contributions of Devitt, Bach and Neale is a highlight of the volume.)<span style="">  </span>Devitt's discussion focuses on incomplete descriptions, where a definite description 'the F' is incomplete at a context just in case the context contains multiple F's.<span style="">  </span>Devitt notes that we regularly use such contextually incomplete descriptions to refer to a contextually salient entity satisfying (but not uniquely satisfying) the nominal 'F'.<span style="">  </span>While Neale shows that it is <i>possible</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> for a quantifier such as </span><i>everyone</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to be used to refer, his account doesn't show how a quantifier can be regularly so used.<span style="">  </span>The seriousness of this concern is highlighted by an example due to Marga Reimer.<span style="">  </span>The verb 'incense' means to 'make angry, enrage; exasperate' (</span><i>OED</i><span style="font-style: normal;">); a secondary meaning is to 'suffuse with fragrance'.<span style="">  </span>The current primary meaning clearly derives from metaphorical applications of the term during the period in which it meant simply to 'suffuse with fragrance'.<span style="">  </span>Before the current primary meaning became standardized, the intended metaphorical application could be derived from the literal meaning, supplemented with contextual information and general pragmatic knowledge.<span style="">  </span>Standardization occurred when the metaphorical application achieved sufficient regularity to become conventional.<span style="">  </span>Now suppose that Mary, although a competent speaker of English, has one lacuna in her knowledge:<span style="">  </span>she is ignorant of the primary meaning of 'incense'.<span style="">  </span>Mary can nonetheless easily interpret an utterance of (say) 'his remark incensed the judge' by appealing to the secondary meaning and working out the speaker's intention. <span style="color:red;"><span style=""> </span></span>Thus what seems an incontrovertibly semantic phenomenon -- that 'incense' means 'make angry, enrage; exasperate' -- is, if we are to follow Grice, best understood as pragmatic.<span style="">  </span>Why, after all, complicate the semantics of 'incense' if we can get by with a single meaning that "explains" both of its uses?<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It is clear that Grice's principle, followed to its logical conclusion, leads us to an absurdity in this case, and so must be set aside.<span style="">  </span>Since it is possible for <i>m</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to be a literal meaning of </span><i>e</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> even though the use of </span><i>e</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to mean </span><i>m</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> admits of a pragmatic explanation, there should be no obstacle in classifying the referential use of an incomplete description as semantic.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Devitt's own proposal takes a referential use <i>u </i><span style="font-style: normal;">of (T) to be true at a world </span><i>w </i><span style="font-style: normal;">just in case the item referred to in </span><i>u</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> exists at </span><i>w</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and is both F and G at </span><i>w</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Thus, Devitt holds that 'the F' in a referential use of (T) is not </span><i>directly</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> referential: it contributes more than its referent to the proposition expressed.<span style="">  </span>A similar effect is achieved by Nathan Salmon in his contribution, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," when he suggests that in uttering </span><i>u</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">one thereby typically asserts two propositions: the general proposition which is the semantic content of the sentence (this is one's literal assertion); and indirectly (and non-literally), in virtue of the first assertion, also the corresponding singular proposition about the person or object that uniquely satisfies [G], if there is one (245).</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">While Salmon is quick to add that this applies in the case of "bad" uses as well -- i.e., uses of 'the F' to refer to a non-F -- he doesn't explicitly consider incomplete descriptions.<a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[7]</span></span></a></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Devitt's treatment of referentially-used incomplete descriptions is truth-conditionally equivalent to one presented by Stephen Neale in his contribution, "This, That, and the Other".<span style="">  </span>Consider (2), uttered as I observe the celebrated philosopher Ferdinand Pergola, who, exhibiting the effects of over-consumption of alcohol, stumbles to the podium to give a lecture (the example is Stephen Schiffer's).<span style="">  </span>Neale claims that my utterance does not involve a completion on the order of (3),<a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[8]</span></span></a> nor does it express the singular proposition (4):</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">2. The guy's drunk.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">3. The guy <i>wearing pink sunglasses</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is drunk.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">4. Pergola is drunk.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Rather, he claims that (2) expresses a proposition containing a Gödelian completion, namely (5): </p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">5. [the <i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">: </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is male & </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> = Pergola] (</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is drunk)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">-- that is, the male identical to Pergola is drunk.<a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[9]</span></span></a><span style="">  </span>This proposition is true at exactly those worlds at which Pergola exists, is male and is drunk.<span style="">  </span>While Devitt is himself agnostic about (2)'s precise logical form, he does agree with Neale that the proposition expressed by the imagined utterance of (2) is truth-conditionally equivalent to (5).</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">This happy coincidence should give one pause.<span style="">  </span>Devitt endorses an<i> ambiguity theory</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, one that denies that Russell's theory applies to all utterances of incomplete descriptions; Neale is a </span><i>Russellian</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, who champions the view that Russell's theory applies to all such utterances.<span style="">  </span>If there is a real issue here, how can their proposals coincide?<span style="">  </span>In fact, Neale is both a Russellian </span><i>and</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> an ambiguity theorist.<span style="">  </span>Where he differs from traditional ambiguity theorists (such as Devitt in earlier papers and Howard Wettstein) is in denying that the referential use of (2) is captured by the singular proposition (4).<span style="">  </span>Rather, he holds that the referential use is captured by a G</span>ö<span style="font-style: normal;">delian completion, as in (5).<span style="">  </span>While this does not depart from Russell as dramatically as the traditional ambiguity theory, it nonetheless raises worries of its own.<span style="">  </span>Presumably, the initial concern posed by the ambiguity theory was not that it challenges the word of Russell, but that it multiplies senses beyond what seems strictly speaking necessary.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Of course, as Neale suggests, there is a question whether we are really multiplying senses here -- whether the fact that certain uses of 'the F' are assigned Gödelian completions constitutes a genuine ambiguity (172-73).<span style="">  </span>An alternative defense of Russell, according to which referentially-used incomplete descriptions receive no special treatment, is provided in Kent Bach's excellent contribution, "Descriptions: Points of Reference".<span style="">  </span>Bach defends an unmodified Russellianism, according to which an actual utterance of (2) will be literally false.<span style="">  </span>Such an approach runs counter to ordinary linguistic intuition; as he nicely puts it, "intuitively, one has no sense that there is any false proposition in the air" (223).<span style="">  </span>Bach claims this can be easily explained: the description's obvious incompleteness leads one to "take it either to be used referentially or with an implicit completion": we never actually process the pure, contextually irrelevant descriptive proposition that constitutes (2)'s literal meaning. <span style="color:black;">Although this response is promising, we are still owed an account of how the description's obvious incompleteness leads us to interpret it referentially or with an implicit completion</span>.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It should be noted that Neale adduces independent evidence for his proposal.<span style="">  </span>For example, he claims (176-182) that Gödelian descriptions are needed to account for contexts in which definite descriptions appear to be bound by antecedent quantifiers.<a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[10]</span></span></a><span style="">  </span>George Wilson has argued that so-called pronominal descriptions provide evidence for the idea that descriptions have a semantically referential function.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"> <a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span style="">[11]</span></a></span><span style="">  </span>If a description can be used as a pronoun in serving as (the natural language equivalent of) a bound variable, then it is plausible that it can be used as a pronoun in serving as a device of reference.<span style="">  </span>Neale shows that Gödelian completions provide an explanation of Wilson's data within a Russellian framework.<span style="">  </span>(Francois Recanati's contribution, "Descriptions and Situations"<span style="">  </span>(36-37), also provides an explanation of Wilson's data, but from within an alternative implementation of Russell's theory.)</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Ernie Lepore's "The Abuse of Context in Semantics: The Case of Incomplete Definite Descriptions" criticizes a popular approach, briefly considered above, according to which context supplements an utterance containing an incomplete description with a completing property.<span style="">  </span>On Lepore's construal, this approach -- the hidden-indexical theory of descriptions -- claims that an utterance of (6) will be completed by a proposition of the form (7):</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">6. The table is covered with books.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">7. [the <i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">: </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> table & </span><i>R</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, α)] (</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> covered with books)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(where α refers to a contextually salient object and <i>R</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> stands for a contextually salient relation).<span style="">  </span>For example, an instance of (7) would be (8):</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">8. [the <i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">: </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> table & In-front-of(</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, me)] (</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> covered with books)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Lepore charges that this strategy overgenerates.<span style="">  </span>An utterance of (6) will give rise to more completions than can plausibly held to exist, one for every salient pair α,<i> R</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> such that exactly one entity at the context satisfies '</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> table & </span><i>R</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, α)'.<span style="">  </span>So far, this is nothing new -- the point is familiar from important papers by Howard Wettstein and Stephen Schiffer.<a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[12]</span></span></a><span style="">  </span>What is new is Lepore's claim that the hidden-indexical theory entails that an utterance of (6) is "multiply ambiguous" (51).<span style="">  </span>Lepore here confuses properties of linguistic types with those of linguistic tokens.<span style="">  </span>According to the hidden-indexical theory, the context-invariant "meaning" assigned to the sentence-type (6) is just the propositional template (7).<span style="">  </span>Perhaps, influenced by Jason Stanley and Zoltan Szabó, Lepore takes the hidden-indexical theory to claim that an utterance of (6) is </span><i>syntactically</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> incomplete, and that context provides lexical supplementation.<a style="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[13]</span></span></a><span style="">  </span>But, as Neale's contribution makes abundantly clear, this is hardly the only interpretation of the hidden-indexical theory on the books, and certainly not the most plausible.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Lepore also considers an argument against an alternative implementation of the hidden-indexical theory, according to which the role of context is not to provide a completing property, but to assign individual domains to each quantifier (different versions of this alternative approach are developed in Recanati's essay and in Richard Breheny's "Indefinites and Anaphoric Dependence").<span style="">  </span>Lepore presents a counterexample to this approach (I have changed his example):<span style="">  </span><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">9. Every band member envies the lead singer.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(9) has two readings, depending on which quantifier takes widest scope.<span style="">  </span>Note that, if the description takes narrow scope, its domain will vary with the choice of band member.<span style="">  </span>This can be seen if we represent the implicit domain reference:</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">10.

to, but rather </span><i>who</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> it is that is on a state visit to (say) China, 'Jones is on state visit to China' would seem to be best captured by '</span><i>Jones</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, that's who's on state visit to China' and not '</span><i>China</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, that's where Jones is on a state visit

Definites", argues similarly that contextual uniqueness is neither semantically encoded nor presupposed by 'the F', although on her view definite descriptions are devices of reference, not existential quantifiers.<span style="">  </span>She maintains that the uniqueness effects commonly exhibited by definite descriptions can be explained pragmatically; see pages 512-15 as well as the more extensive
