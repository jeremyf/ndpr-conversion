<p class="MsoBodyText">Like a good detective or archaeologist (in the common sense) Paras has pursued every lead and grounded his new interpretation of Foucault's archive on Foucault's most obscure and unpublished writings and lectures.<span style="">  </span>Most of these obscurities are available in <i>Dits et Ecrits</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, but Paras makes a major contribution by meticulously mining nearly two hundred hours of cassette recordings.<span style="">  </span>He treats these lecture courses as independent Foucaultian texts with their own integrity and effectively reveals that they should in fact be so treated.<span style="">  </span>Paras calls these the "starting point" of his work.<span style="">  </span>The reader already familiar with the literature on Foucault will find this a fresh, stimulating, provocative read.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Paras recounts several fascinating confrontations between Foucault and other leading voices of his time.<span style="">  </span>The discussion of <i>The Archaeology of Knowledge</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as a direct response to Sartre is especially illuminating.<span style="">  </span>The reader will find this treatment much more in line with that of an intellectual historian than the philosophical investigation of Thomas R. Flynn's exploration of the Foucault/Sartre relationship (</span><i>Sartre, Foucault, and Historical Reason: A Poststructuralist Mapping of History</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, 2 Volumes, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2005).<span style="">  </span>Paras reads </span><i>The Archaeology of Knowledge</i><span style="font-style: normal;">'s conclusion as a confrontation, orchestrated by Foucault, between Foucault and Sartre.<span style="">  </span>The author's juxtaposition of the final remarks of Sartre's </span><i>The Words</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and those of </span><i>The Archaeology of Knowledge</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> provides a chilling -- yes, "cold-blooded" -- conclusion.<span style="">            </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Paras provides a very sympathetic discussion of "one of the most indecipherable" and "mystifying" moments in Foucault's career: his positive initial response to the Iranian revolution.<span style="">  </span>Events of the winter of 1978-1979 dampened Foucault's enthusiasm for the revolution, leading him to abandon the concepts of the primacy of the state, ideology, class, repression, the mode of production, and dialectics in his understanding of power, separating himself from Marxism and adopting the liberal categories of rights and the rule of law.<span style="">  </span>Some of these categories reappeared during Foucault's chairmanship of the Marxist philosophy department at Vincennes, but their return was short-lived.<span style="">  </span>Paras, the intellectual historian, traces this transition in Foucault's thought to the influence of the new <i>philosophes </i><span style="font-style: normal;">-- especially Glucksmann and Levy -- and of his friend Gilles Deleuze.<span style="">  </span>Paras tells this story in a much slower, more careful, thoroughly documented fashion than that recounted here.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The title,<i> Foucault 2.0: Beyond Power and Knowledge</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, at first seemed a bit pretentious.<span style="">  </span>Yes, like your latest Microsoft program, the company of Foucault students has made a quantum leap beyond previous studies with this new edition.<span style="">  </span>My local computer expert, however, assures me that a "two-point-zero" indicates only a modest incremental advance.<span style="">  </span>But, indeed, we have reached a new level with this exciting new piece of work.<span style="">  </span>What warrants the "two-point-zero" claim is Paras's assertion that Foucault moved "Beyond Power and Knowledge" and abandoned archaeology and genealogy, the hallmarks of his philosophical enterprise.<span style="">  </span>It is certainly a bold claim.<span style="">  </span>Foucault's 1979 course, </span><i>The Birth of Biopolitics</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, the spadework for the first volume of </span><i>The History of Sexuality</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> where Foucault writes extensively of genealogy and power, according to Paras, "saw the gradual abandonment of genealogy. . . ."<span style="">  </span>Paras asks, "Why did Foucault stop using the word 'archaeology' to describe his researches?"<span style="">  </span>(p. 46).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Well, he didn't.<span style="">  </span>He neither abandoned genealogy (at least in his own mind) nor stopped using the word "archaeology."<span style="">  </span>And, of course, a careful scholar like Paras knows this; his mastery of the appropriate texts is undeniable.<span style="">  </span>Just a year before he died, Foucault was asked about the "shift in the methodological focus" of his work from archaeology to genealogy.<span style="">  </span>Foucault responded that the difference is between method and goal and that he never stopped doing either archaeology or genealogy ("The Culture of the Self" discussion session, available at the Cal Berkeley Language Lab).<span style="">   </span>Just a month before he died, <i>L'usage des plaisirs</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> appeared with a description of the work in terms of archaeology and genealogy.<span style="">  </span>The precise dating is unclear, but "What is Enlightenment?" appeared about this time with an important discussion of archaeology and genealogy.<span style="">   </span>The author might still want to argue his case, but these few obvious discrepancies in the texts call for attention.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Another major claim arises in the form of a question: "How and why does Foucault go from being a philosopher of the disappearance of the subject to one wholly preoccupied with the subject?"<span style="">  </span>Perhaps the question's formulation is too facile.<span style="">  </span>Clearly Foucault in his early writings attacked the subject of phenomenology, but it is not clear that his preoccupation with the subject was a late interest.<span style="">  </span>On one of the many occasions he rejected the "structuralist" label -- and Paras cites this -- Foucault described the early <i>Archaeology of Knowledge</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>The Order of Things</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as concerned with the field where "questions of human being, consciousness, origin, and the subject make their appearance" (p. 37).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">This reviewer disagrees with a couple of Paras's assertions but finds the work extremely well written and researched and thought-provoking.<span style="">  </span>It is an admirable piece of scholarship.</p>
