<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Back in the 1980s, Tom  Carson followed-up a co-authored article on bluffing in labor negotiations with a sole-authored article  on the definition of lying.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup>  Years later, in 2006, he came out with an influential article, "The Definition of Lying", as well as a subsequent article on the lies of the Bush administration, "Liar, Liar".<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup> His latest book, <i style="">Lying and Deception: Theory and Practice</i>, brings together his work on lying and deception  with his work in ethical theory and in business ethics.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The book is divided into three parts. In part I, "Concepts", Carson advances definitions of lying and deception, as well as the related concepts of 'keeping someone in the dark',  withholding information, concealing information, 'putting spin on a story', telling a 'half-truth', and bullshitting. In part II, "Moral Theory", he considers arguments against lying and deception from Kant,  act-utilitarians like Mill (at least, Mill under an act-utilitarian interpretation), rule-consequentialists like Brad Hooker, and the intuitionist W. D.  Ross. Rejecting Kant's absolute prohibition against lying and arguing that the  prohibition is not entailed by any formula of the categorical imperative, he concludes  that the arguments against lying that rely on appeals to intuitions or  considered moral judgments (Ross and Hooker, especially) reach a "dialectical impasse" because "ostensibly reasonable people disagree in their moral intuitions and considered moral judgments" (p. 122) about lying  and deception. He then advances a theory of rationality and a theory of  consistency in moral reasoning (for those who actually make moral judgments) that  entails a version of the Golden Rule, and he argues that, </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The moral principles  and moral judgments about lying and deception that survive consistency and  rationality tests support a moral presumption against harmful lying and deception  that is at least as strong as that endorsed by (welfare-maximizing versions of) act-utilitarianism (p. 8). </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In part III, "Applications", he considers lying and deception in sales, advertising, negotiations, and various  professions, as well as the lies told and deceptions practiced by politicians in order  to precipitate wars (especially the Iraq War) or prevent wars, and the lies  and half-truths told in the rewriting of history, including the blaming of  socialists and Jews for the defeat of Germany in WWI, and the recasting of the  Civil War as a war "for states' rights and constitutional liberties, not to defend the institution of human slavery" (p. 243). He concludes this final part with a discussion of honesty as a virtue, both in the negative sense -- a "strong principled disinclination to tell lies or deceive others" -- and the positive sense -- "being candid, open, and willing to reveal information" (p. 257) in addition to having this disinclination -- and defends honesty as a virtue in the negative sense. I will focus on the  first two parts of the book.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carson accepts that "no definition of deception  can be consistent with everyone's linguistic intuitions about all cases",  but he does hold that "The morally salient feature of deception is that it involves intentionally causing others to have false beliefs that one  believes to be false or does not believe to be true" (p. 49). (Note that Carson  is not concerned with self-deception). He offers several pairs of  definitions, the differences between them concerning whether deception must involve intentionally causing another person to believe or persist in believing  what is false and <i style="">what is believed to be false</i>, or merely <i style="">what is not believed to be true</i>, and whether the causing can be causing of any kind, including that which bypasses a person's agency (such as stimulating a person's cortex, or hypnotizing or drugging another person), or whether the causing must  consist in bringing about evidence on the basis of which the false belief is  created or maintained. In allowing for a definition of deception according to which  it may involve intentional causing of any kind, Carson argues against what I  have said on this matter.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup>  However, upon reading this chapter, I became convinced that intentionally  operating on your brain while you are asleep with the result that you believe a  falsehood when you wake up should at least be up for consideration as a case of 'deception'.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In general, I have no problem with the  definitions of deception defended in chapter 2 of the book. My concern is with what  Carson says about the following case: I believe X to be completely true; I also believe that there are "serious reasons for doubting the truth of X"; "I assert the truth of X on a solemn occasion"; I intend to cause others to believe X; and "I intend to cause others to (falsely) believe that there is strong, unambiguous evidence for the truth of X" (pp. 52-53). About this case Carson says that, "withholding information about the counter-evidence constitutes [attempted] deception" (p. 53). I agree that, as given, this is a case of attempted deception, but I do not see  it as a case of withholding-information-as-attempted-deception. In this case, I  intend that others believe what is false, namely, that "there is strong, unambiguous evidence for the truth of X"; hence, this is attempted deception about evidence for X. I should not be said to be withholding information (about evidence for X).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carson also says that, </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">withholding  information can constitute deception if there is a clear expectation, promise, and/or professional obligation that such information will be provided. If a tax advisor is aware of a legitimate tax exemption her client can claim that  would allow the client to achieve considerable tax savings, her failure to  inform the client about it constitutes deception. She thereby intentionally causes  her client to believe falsely that there is no way for him to save more  money on his taxes (p. 56). </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Of course, if the tax advisor "intentionally  causes her client to believe falsely [etc.]", she deceives her client; the question is whether, by failing to inform a client about a legitimate  exemption when there is a clear expectation/promise/professional obligation to do  so, she thereby intentionally causes her client to believe a falsehood. If it is possible, in general, for someone to withhold information <i style="">without</i>  intending to deceive, as Carson does allow, then I am not sure that the fact of the existence of such a clear expectation entails  that the tax advisor has a deceptive intention. The question is about when a  person may be said to possess an intention. Later, Carson says about this case  that it is "tantamount to deception" (p. 260), but that does not help.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In addition to allowing for withholding  information, etc., without an intention to deceive, Carson allows for lying without  an intention to deceive. Importantly, then, Carson does <i style="">not</i>  consider lying to be a form of (attempted) deception, although the vast majority of lies are attempts to deceive (p. 56, figure 2.1).  As he says, if he is a reluctant witness called to testify about a murder, it  can be the case that </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">I make the false  statement that I did not see the defendant commit the crime, for fear of being killed  by him. However, I do not intend that my false statements deceive anyone. . . .  Giving false testimony is necessary to save my life, but deceiving others is  not; the deception is merely an unintended "side effect" (p. 20). </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This is his main reason for rejecting other  definitions of lying in chapter 1 and replacing them with his own pair of  definitions. Carson's first definition, defended originally in 2006, requires that a  liar (i) make a false statement to another person that she believes to be  false or probably false, and (ii) makes the statement "in a context in which" she thereby "warrants the truth" of the statement to the other person, and does not take herself to be not warranting the truth of the statement (p. 30). To warrant the truth of a statement is to promise or guarantee, either explicitly or implicitly, that the statement is true  (p. 26). His second definition, defended in face of criticisms of the original  (since it ruled some seeming lies as non-lies<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup>),  introduces an intention. Requirement (ii) is replaced with the requirement that the  liar (ii*) "intends to warrant" the truth of the false statement to the other person (p. 37).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">While the second definition of lying manages to  avoid certain objections, to my mind there remains a problem with the notion  of 'warranting' in both definitions. Carson says that "when one warrants the truth of a statement or assertion <i style="">the default</i> is that one invites others to believe it" [italics in original], and "Warranting the truth of a statement presupposes that the statement is  being used to invite or influence belief", and "Because warranting the truth of a statement is necessary for lying, when one lies one thereby  invites others to believe it, short of doing or saying something to nullify or  call into question the implicit invitation conveyed by warranting the statement" (p. 36). I did not understand Carson to hold, originally,  that warranting involves implicitly inviting one's audience to believe what  one is saying. If warranting (or warranting in non-ironic (etc.) contexts)  involves implicitly inviting others to believe one's statement to be true, then  the witness on the stand in the murder trial, who is warranting the truth of  what he says, is implicitly inviting the jury to believe his falsehood to be  true. I am no longer sure, now, what it means to say that the witness invites  the jury to believe his falsehood to be true, but does not intend that they  believe his falsehood to be true (and hence, lacks an intention to deceive).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carson's denial that lying is a form of  attempted deception does raise the question of what is distinctively <i style="">wrong</i>  with lying. He holds that (all) lying "involves a breach of trust" (p. 3), where this is different from intending to deceive. However, Carson does not argue that there is a moral presumption against  lying as such. He argues that there is a moral presumption against <i style="">harmful</i>  lying. It does seem, therefore, that lying is wrong, when it is wrong, for the same reason that  attempted deception is wrong, when it is wrong, namely, when it harms. As he says, "there is a strong moral presumption against lying and deception when  they cause harm" (p. 2), and "We are (generally) harmed when we are deceived because we cannot effectively pursue our ends and interests if  we act on the basis of false beliefs" (p. 5). It seems that the moral  presumption against harmful lying that Carson defends is derived from the more basic  moral presumption against causing or intending harm,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup> and that there is nothing wrong with a lie otherwise. There is little consideration given to the idea that telling a lie is wrong because, for example, it is manipulative and violates a person's autonomy, or it  abuses a person's trust and is disrespectful.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carson does argue, against Christine Korsgaard  (on Kant on lying), that "Recognizing and respecting you as an autonomous agent  is compatible with recognizing that coercing or deceiving you might be  appropriate in certain circumstances" (p. 85). That is, he holds that not all lying violates a person's autonomy. This may be so if consensual lying is  possible,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup> but it does not answer the question of whether, in cases in which a  person is lied to without her consent, where the lie is not intended to harm her  and doesn't harm her, it is still possible for the lie to be wrong. About  such a case ("Suppose that I lie about my age to a stranger on a train . . . It is hard to see how being misinformed about my age could possibly harm  her or anyone else" (p. 106)) there seems to be little moral concern. The case only becomes morally relevant when harm is re-introduced in the form of  harm to the liar: "my lying to the stranger is likely to harm my character by making me less honest" (p. 106) ("The good and bad consequences of lying include the serious problems that lying often creates for the  liar" (p. 98)).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">I do not say that Carson must or should hold  that it is wrong to tell such a 'harmless' lie, just that the default position on  lying is not that of hardliners such as Kant and Paul Griffiths,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[7]</span></span></a></sup> who defend an absolute prohibition against all lying, but that of Ross  and Hooker, who hold that there is a moral presumption against lying. This  is different from what seems to be Carson's much more permissive position  that there is (only) a moral presumption against harmful lying, such that  there is <i style="">nothing</i> morally objectionable whatsoever about a harmless lie. I say 'seems' because Carson later says that there  is a "strong" moral presumption against harmful lying, and that his theory leaves open "the possibility that lying and deception are wrong in a broader range of cases as well" (p. 157). That would indeed eliminate  the difference between him and Ross/Hooker. The difference between the more  and less permissive non-absolutist positions needs to be highlighted and  debated at the normative ethical level, I believe. This is true even if it is  agreed to by all that the claim that it is self-evident that it is wrong to tell such  a 'harmless' lie is unhelpful (Carson quotes his own students as saying,  in response to Ross, "'What's the harm of lying?' [!] or 'What's the big deal?'" (p. 111)). Here I must add one final point about his opponents. Carson says, several times, that "Hooker never mentions deception, and I take it that, like Ross, he does not think that deception is <i style="">prima  facie</i> wrong" (p. 116). The fact that Ross (and Hooker) do not separately address the wrongfulness  of deception should not be taken to mean that they hold that there is no  moral presumption at all against deception.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">I cannot here do justice to Carson's defense of  the Golden Rule, according to which "if I claim that it is permissible for someone to do something to another person, then, on pain of  inconsistency, I cannot object if someone else does the same thing to me (or someone I  love) in relevantly similar circumstances" (p. 135), nor to his application of  his definitions and moral arguments to the range of issues considered in the  final chapters. I suspect that many will be sympathetic to his conclusions  here. This book is important insofar as it is a lengthy treatment of a topic that  is too often relegated to parts of books or articles. Thankfully, this  situation is changing, and Carson has done much to bring about this change.</p>    <div style="">
