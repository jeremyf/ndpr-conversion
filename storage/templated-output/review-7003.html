<p class="MsoBodyText">In his short novel, <i>Billy Budd, Foretopman</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1891), Herman Melville presents the tragedy of a physically strong and attractive young seaman, innocent of heart and worldly experience -- a naïve, beautiful soul, in a sense -- whose capital crime was to lash out instinctively at a malevolent superior officer who had falsely charged him with mutiny.<span style="">  </span>The novel's ensuing and concluding reflections upon the tensions between moral truth and legal necessity approach some of the finest to be found in moral philosophy.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Melville was an outstanding American novelist with acute philosophical insight, but he is not among the leading Western philosophers.<span style="">  </span>Friedrich Schiller, one of Germany's finest poets and playwrights, wrote a small proportion of philosophical letters and essays, and he accordingly remains an ambiguous and confusing figure:<span style="">  </span>academic philosophy professionals usually dismiss him as a philosophical amateur; some intellectuals celebrate him as a first-rate philosophical theoretician.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In <i>Schiller as Philosopher:<span style="">  </span>A Re-Examination</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, Frederick Beiser asserts that Schiller's philosophical accomplishments are on a par with his dramatic and poetic achievements, and that as a philosopher, Schiller can be fruitfully and favorably compared with writers of Immanuel Kant's stature.<span style="">  </span>To transform the commonly-encountered opinion that Schiller's philosophical writings are too muddled to count as respectable philosophy, and to set the record straight about what Schiller actually maintained, Beiser introduces his book with a list of "myths" about Schiller.<span style="">  </span>The study aims to show that each of the following claims (quoted from pp. 10-12, here reorganized into two thematic clusters) is a misconception:</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"></p><blockquote>I.<span style="">  </span>Myths about Schiller's early writings, and about his famous <i>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</i><span style="font-style: normal;">:</span></blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;"></span>

<p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"></p><blockquote>It is generally recognized that one of the most creative periods of aesthetics was that from Baumgarten to Hegel. . . .<span style="">  </span>Among the crowning achievements of this period are Schiller's aesthetic essays, which were written from 1791 to 1795.<span style="">  </span>Schiller's three major essays -- <i>Anmut und Würde</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1793) ["On Grace and Dignity"], </span><i>Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen in einer Reihe von Briefen</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1795) [</span><i>On the Aesthetic Education of Man in a Series of Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;">], and </span><i>Über naïve und sentimentalische Dichtung</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1795) ["On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry"] -- have been regarded as classics.<span style="">  </span>Since their publication over two centuries ago, they have been the subject of intensive discussion and commentary.<span style="">  </span>(p.1)</span></blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;"></span>
<p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It should now be evident that the book initially stimulates some puzzlement.<span style="">  </span>The title is <i>Schiller as Philosopher</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and it concentrates squarely on Schiller's philosophical-aesthetic writings.<span style="">  </span>The goal is to reveal his intellectual stature as a genuine, first-rate philosopher.<span style="">  </span>Schiller wrote three major philosophical essays and within the field of philosophical aesthetics, these three are among the crowning achievements of the period as a whole.<span style="">  </span>Each of the book's chapters is self-contained, so there is some repetition and overlap between the chapters.<span style="">  </span>The book addresses only two out of the three famous philosophical essays, and omits the third owing to lack of space.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The omission of one of Schiller's three most important philosophical essays is disappointing, although the book contains many redeeming scholarly contributions.<span style="">  </span>"On Grace and Dignity" is difficult to locate in English translation, and sections from "On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry" and the <i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> are the most anthologized of Schiller's writings within the English-speaking philosophical community.<span style="">  </span>Anyone who teaches Schiller, upon becoming aware of this book, will immediately and eagerly anticipate analyses of the </span><i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and "On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry."<span style="">  </span>Unfortunately, one quickly realizes that a treatment of the latter will be left out "for reasons of space."</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">This absence leaves the portrait undone.<span style="">  </span>We are later told, for instance, that in the <i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> "Schiller takes a position on the state of nature that is diametrically opposed to Rousseau" and that "the point is worth stressing because Schiller is so often regarded as subscribing to an idealistic conception of man's natural state" (p. 158).<span style="">  </span>As many know, Schiller is often associated with such an idealistic conception, precisely because he states explicitly in "On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry" that:</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"></p><blockquote>As long as we were children of nature merely, we enjoyed happiness and perfection; we became free, and lost both.<span style="">  </span>Thence arises a dual and very unequal longing for nature, a longing for her happiness, a longing for her perfection.<span style=""> </span></blockquote><span style=""> </span>
<p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It can remain an open question whether Schiller changed his mind between writing the <i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and "On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry," or whether Beiser has overemphasized Schiller's remarks to the contrary, or whether the two positions are somehow consistent.<span style="">  </span>The present point is simply that the lack of a chapter on "On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry" leaves many questions open, and generates the perception that the manuscript was unwisely truncated.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Nonetheless, we have an excellently researched presentation that instructively reveals how ignorance tends still to prevail in certain segments of the history of philosophy.<span style="">  </span>Beiser's <i>forte</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is to show how certain writers who are virtually unknown today, were once well-known, influential during their time, and essential to appreciate today if we are to understand the philosophical formulations intelligently.<span style="">  </span></span><i>Schiller as Philosopher</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is probably, to date, the most reliable exposition of what Schiller actually said, and it is one of the sharpest displays of how mistaken some hitherto prevailing interpretations of Schiller have been.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The price of such a historically-centered style, one must add, is to produce texts that are predominantly expository and exegetical.<span style="">  </span>Frequently and satisfying enough, however, we are given examples of Schiller's underlying philosophical argumentation.<span style="">  </span>One is as follows:</p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"></p> <blockquote>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">(1)<span style="">  </span>Reason demands that we should perfect our humanity.</p>     <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">(2)<span style="">  </span>The perfection of humanity consists in the unity of the form and sense drives.</p>     <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">(3)<span style="">  </span>The unity of the form and sense drives is beauty.</p>     <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">Therefore [(4)], reason demands that we should create beauty.<span style="">  </span>(p. 144)</p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">A multitude of critical questions can be raised about the plausibility of the above conceptual definitions and logical entailments, not to mention the apparent oppressiveness of how reason "demands" (at what social cost?) that we should create beauty.<span style="">  </span>The book succeeds nevertheless in establishing that Schiller's philosophizing typically has a <i>prima facie</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> coherent, logical rationale and is not fundamentally and obviously confused.<span style="">  </span>The philosophical encapsulations offered may be brief in some instances, but they are benchmark starting-points and first approximations for anyone who wishes to explore Schiller's argumentation more deeply.<span style="">  </span>As a rule, philosophical contents are sprinkled tastefully and noticeably into the main informational/historical/expository project, as sugar might be added to coffee.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The result is an excellent contribution to Schiller scholarship that historians of philosophy will enjoy and honor.<span style="">  </span>Those who expect a crisp, detailed, and extended analysis of the philosophical issues that Schiller introduces, however, will sometimes only be tantalized.<span style="">  </span>The book covers much ground, and it is essentially a meticulously-researched and historically informative apology for Schiller's philosophizing, just as the <i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> themselves, according to Beiser, constitute Schiller's own apology for beauty.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">We can now briefly consider Beiser's views on a couple of central interpretive issues.<span style="">  </span>Most non-specialist readers of the book will be interested mainly in the chapter on the <i>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Beiser claims that the </span><i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is not aestheticist (i.e., it is not escapist) and is instead politically and morally oriented towards actively improving social life.<span style="">  </span>This is because aesthetic education -- one's self-conscious attention to, spiritual absorption of, and consequent behavioral instantiation of beauty -- aims to reinforce and cultivate people's moral awareness in a concrete, and not merely abstracted and contemplative sense.<span style="">  </span>This is for the sake of creating good citizens.<span style="">  </span>Ideally, aesthetic education will produce a set of people who will automatically act morally when they are given their freedom, as opposed to having violent and retributive inclinations, as happened horribly in France during Schiller's time.<span style="">  </span>The 1793-95 </span><i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> was written during and immediately after the French Revolution's bloody gravitation into the 1793-94 Reign of Terror, and Schiller had the chaotic French political situation troublingly in mind.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">A prevailing view of Schiller's <i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (not to mention the bulk of his philosophical corpus) is that it is fundamentally conflicted:<span style="">  </span>in some letters, beauty is described as a means to a moral end; in others it is described as an end in itself.<span style="">  </span>It is, of course, not contradictory for something to be both a means to certain ends, while being simultaneously an end in itself.<span style="">  </span>People are ends in themselves while they are also the means to achieve other purposes; virtues are also ends in themselves while they are also the means to other purposes such as happiness.<span style="">  </span>There is no conflict in principle.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Beiser argues that when beauty is treated as a means in the <i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, aesthetic education is the main topic, and that when beauty is treated as an end in itself, the analysis or "analytic" of beauty is being highlighted.<span style="">  </span>These are different and consistent aims.<span style="">  </span>We accordingly read that "while the discussion of aesthetic education treats beauty as an instrument for moral and political ends, the theory of beauty regards it as an end in itself" (p. 123) and are led to infer that "the </span><i>Ästhetische Briefe</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> cannot be regarded, following its title, simply as a treatise on aesthetic education."<span style="">  </span>The sections concerning beauty as an end in itself are consequently regarded as logically independent of, consistent with, and complementary to aesthetic education.<span style="">  </span>Beiser integrates the two projects consistently by characterizing the </span><i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as an "apology for beauty," thus locating both aesthetic education and the theory of beauty under an amorphous umbrella-concept.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Schiller's two presentations of beauty are indeed consistent with each other and the <i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> are not fundamentally confused.<span style="">  </span>If, however, the </span><i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is not escapist, but is essentially empirically-focused, political and moral in its inspiration, then it is unsatisfying to characterize the more theoretical or transcendental analytic of beauty as a logically independent, yet thoroughly consistent pendant to the more empirical discussion of aesthetic education.<span style="">  </span>One would aim for a logically tighter and determinate connection between the empirical theory of aesthetic education and the transcendental theory of beauty.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">A more integrated rendition would regard aesthetic education as the single, essential, permeating, comprehensive and overriding theme of the <i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, for at least five reasons:<span style="">  </span>(1) the manuscript was in fact entitled "aesthetic education," (2) Schiller was concerned with overcoming tyranny ever since he was a teenager, (3) Schiller was seriously alarmed about the Reign of Terror when he wrote the </span><i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, (4) "freedom is indeed the central theme behind all Schiller's writing" (p. 213), and with regard to the supposedly ill-fitting theory of beauty, (5) transcendental inquiries are prerequisite to empirical inquiries.<span style="">  </span>Since the point of transcendental inquiries is to explain the very possibility of empirical payoffs such as scientific knowledge and moral behavior, the consequent purpose of Schiller's transcendental theory of beauty in the </span><i>Letters</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> can be seen as establishing the unconditional grounds for the possibility of aesthetic education.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The notion of aesthetic education contains the wherewithal to conceive of beauty consistently as a means and as an end in both empirical and transcendental terms.<span style="">  </span>Schiller writes:</p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"></p> <blockquote>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">Through Beauty the sensuous person is led to form and to thought; through Beauty, the spiritual person is brought back to matter and restored to the sensory world.<span style="">  </span>(Letter XVIII)</p>     <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">Durch die Schönheit wird der sinnliche Mensch zur Form und zum Denken geleitet; durch die Schönheit wird der geistige Mensch zur Materie zurückgeführt and der Sinnenwelt wiedergegeben.</p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">For someone who is steeped in the sensory and selfish mode of being, beauty -- as defined by Schiller's transcendental and integrating "impulse theory" -- can serve to render the perception of the sensory world more disinterested, and can thereby allow such a person, via the disinterestedness involved, to ascend to a more purely conceptual awareness where inherent moral ideas can enter more impressively into awareness.<span style="">  </span>Here, beauty serves as the means to <i>ascend</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to moral ideas and constitutes the first half of the aesthetically educative process.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">For political and social purposes, however, it is furthermore essential to <i>concretize</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> one's moral awareness for the sake of rendering it practically applicable.<span style="">  </span>This, Schiller believes, can </span><i>also</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> be realized by beauty, and when this </span><i>is</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> in fact achieved, a person will become a beautiful soul, an end-in-itself.<span style="">  </span>With the realization of this end, owing, one could say, to the moral "naturalness" implicit in such a beautifully-appearing-and-behaving being, social and political ends are simultaneously realized as well.<span style="">  </span>In the ascent to moral awareness, beauty functions merely as a means, but in the concretization of morality and consequent rationalizing education of the natural inclinations, beauty serves as both a means and end in itself.<span style="">  </span>This is all part of aesthetic education; the theory of beauty answers the Kantian question, "How is aesthetic education possible?"</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The remaining "myths" cited at the outset concern Schiller's relationship with Kant, and Beiser convincingly dissolves some decades-long misconceptions of Schiller's moral theory.<span style="">  </span>What emerges from the discussions, often repeated, is that Schiller, agreeing with Kant, maintained that morality has a purely rational foundation and that having inclinations towards doing one's duty (the "how" of moral activity) is consistent with being non-empirically and purely rationally motivated (the "why" of moral activity).<span style="">  </span>This, Beiser observes, compares well with what neo-Kantian moral philosophers assert of Kant, although he adds that many of them fail to appreciate that Schiller held much the same views.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The standing differences between Kant and Schiller in this moral regard, we are told, concern their conflicting conception of the highest good.<span style="">  </span>Kant's unconditional <i>a priori</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> moral foundation for the highest good (viz., as universal happiness conjoined with universal moral behavior) conflicts with Schiller's "anthropological" account, since the latter additionally advocates the development of individuality in conjunction with the development of the senses as ends in themselves.<span style="">  </span>Kant would surely object to the development of the senses as ends in themselves, owing to their empirical and conditional nature.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In sum, the book's central thesis is that "in fundamental respects, Schiller's ethics and aesthetics are an improvement on Kant's" (p. 2).<span style="">  </span>Schiller is not merely elevated to match Kant's status; he is rendered controversially into Kant's philosophical superior in terms of the quality of his insights.<span style="">  </span>This reflects Beiser's initial statement that he "has come to praise rather than to bury Schiller" (p. viii).<span style="">  </span>Amidst this celebration, the rhetorical tone appears to acknowledge Kant's ideas only out of necessity, for Kant is dutifully expounded, but rarely praised.<span style="">  </span>This is somewhat unmindful of how Schiller obviously stands on Kant's shoulders at virtually every juncture.<span style="">  </span>Perhaps the literary tone is justified by this impressive study's overriding aim to acknowledge Schiller's individuality as a philosopher, how he often departed from Kant, and how many other thinkers influenced him as well.</p>
