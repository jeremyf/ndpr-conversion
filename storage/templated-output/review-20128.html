â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Kant has two theories of  action. One is empirical, a determinist account of actions in terms of the psychological causes that  bring those actions about. The broad structure of this account will not seem particularly surprising nor particularly Kantian: certain kinds of  beliefs and desires cause human beings to act in certain ways, and consistent  patterns of belief, desire, and action in a person are ascribed to the "character" of that person. While McCarty develops a Leibnizian-Wolffian rather than Humean version of Kant's empirical  psychology, its general structure is consistent with most naturalist theories of  action. Moreover, while some Kant scholars deny that Kant has any such  determinist psychological theory, most Kantians admit there must be <i style="">some</i>  sort of causal theory of observable actions, but haven't bothered to figure out what it is. McCarty does a valuable service in  starting discussion of Kant's empirical account of action. And while later in  this review, I raise objections to some of his claims, his discussions of  such topics as maxims (chapter 1), incentives (chapter 2), and respect for  the moral law (chapter 6) are discussions that Kant scholars -- to whom this book  is directed<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> -- should consult when they find themselves thinking about these topics.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Kant is most famous, however, not for his  empirical account but for his other theory of action, the one associated with  human freedom, and this account has traditionally been both more  philosophically important and more contentious than the understudied and underappreciated  empirical theory of action to which McCarty brings our attention. At present, the dominant approach to Kant's non-determinist theory of action sees this  theory as describing action from a particular "standpoint," the first-person standpoint from which one deliberates about or (morally) evaluates  actions. McCarty objects to this "two standpoint" approach and returns to a more traditional way of making sense of how Kant reconciles determinist  psychology with freedom by distinguishing two "worlds": through free action in the noumenal world "we have . . . chosen the characters we now portray  in this grand theatre of the empirical world" (xxiii). For most Kant scholars, this articulation and defense of what has become known as a "two-world" interpretation of Kant's transcendental idealism will be the most philosophically important -- but also, alas, disappointing --  aspect of McCarty's book.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">One of McCarty's central arguments against  two-standpoint interpretations of Kant, and one of the guiding threads in his book as a  whole, is what he calls "the problem of justification and explanation" (91). One way to put the problem is that Kant's theory of action must both <i style="">explain</i> actions and show how they can be <i style="">justified</i>:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">I think Kant's view  is that practical reasoning both justifies and explains action. It seems to me  that most writers on Kant's practical philosophy are convinced of this also.  But I do not find among them a satisfactory explanation of how practical  reasoning can do both. (1)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Here "explanation" is something like causal, psychological explanation, while "justification" is what is typically considered a first-person, reason-based account for why a particular  course of action is worthy of choice. And I think that McCarty is right that most Kantians think that Kant should be able to both explain and justify  action. But McCarty further articulates what I would call a "strong" problem of justification and explanation, one that most Kantians do <i style="">not</i>  think that Kant needs to do, the task of "showing how the practical reasoning that justifies action can also explain it" (87).  That is, McCarty wants <i style="">the very same account</i> of practical reasoning that is used to explain action to also be the  account that justifies it, since, he claims, "what justifies action should be capable of explaining it; otherwise, justification is irrelevant" (27).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">McCarty's book traces the problem of  justification and explanation through a discussion of Kant's two theories of action,  starting in chapters 1 and 2 with his empirical psychology, moving in chapters 3-5  into his (two-world) theory of freedom, and ending with a couple of chapters  directed towards applications of the theory laid out in the book.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In chapters 1 and 2, McCarty lays out Kant's empirically-determinist theory of action. Chapter 1 focuses on the role  of <i style="">maxims</i>, which McCarty sees as the major premises of practical syllogisms that result in "motives" for action. Every maxim, for McCarty, has the form "X is good," so that one might reason from "happiness is good" (a maxim) and "jumping off this bridge now will increase happiness" (a particular judgment) to "jumping off this bridge now is good" (a "motive" to jump off the bridge).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup> Chapter 2 focuses on the role of <i style="">incentives</i> in action, which McCarty identifies in general as "the psychological  force of a maxim" (33), but goes on to distinguish as either "subjective" or "objective." Subjectively, an incentive is a "psychologically compelling motive force" (33); objectively, the incentive is the "target" of one's motive. Thus "happiness" could be an "objective" incentive, while that which gives happiness the force to motivate one to jump off a bridge would be the "subjective" incentive that is incorporated into the maxim "happiness is good."</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">By the end of these first two chapters, McCarty  claims to have accomplished two important goals. First, he has laid out his  general empirical account of action, where any action can be explained by the  maxims that have the strongest incentives incorporated into them combined with  the judgments by virtue of which those maxims give rise to motivationally  efficacious motives to specific actions. Since "maxims are desires" (13), this gives Kant a familiar strongest-desire + belief model of action, but  with the Wolffian twist that "desires" here should be understood as incentivized maxims. Second, and because of this Wolffian twist, McCarty  claims to have solved the problem of justification and explanation because "maxims are principles of practical reasoning, by which actions are justified, and incentives incorporated into maxims have explanatory  power for the actions their maxims justify" (60).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The next three chapters of the book develop  McCarty's two-world account of noumenal action. In chapter 3, McCarty uses the  problem of justification and explanation to offer a sustained attack on what he  (wrongly) takes to be the standard view of Kant, which denies psychological  determinism in order to make room for transcendental freedom.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup> McCarty barrages his opponents with various arguments here, but his main overall criticism is that explanation via freedom makes solving the  (strong) problem of explanation and justification impossible. Chapter 4 lays out McCarty's account of Kantian freedom, according to which freedom takes  place in a noumenal world within which "actions [are] free," and "everything we do here is an appearance of what we do there" (105). Chapter 5 criticizes two-standpoint interpretations of Kant's  transcendental idealism and defends his account against various objections to the  notion of noumenal, timeless agency.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Finally, the last two chapters take up more  specific topics in Kant's theory of action, applying the general theory to moral motivation (in chapter 6) and human evil (in chapter 7). The conclusion  briefly discusses our "grounds for hope" and includes Kantian metaphysical musings about the afterlife.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the end, <i style="">Kant's Theory of Action</i> does not succeed in providing two important and  sorely needed contributions that it aims to provide for Kant scholarship today:  a detailed account of Kant's psychologically determinist theory of action  and a spirited defense of a two world interpretation of Kant's transcendental idealism. Before turning to some criticisms, I want to join McCarty in emphasizing the importance of both aims. Kant's theory of action has  long been discussed within writing on his moral philosophy, where the emphasis has  been on how free practical agency gives Kant a conception of action much  different than broadly empiricist belief-desire models dominant today. But this  emphasis has obscured Kant's empirical theory of action and weakened Kant's  relevance to contemporary debates about empirical psychology. And there is a need  today to revisit debates about whether Kant's view is best interpreted in terms  of two standpoints rather than two metaphysically distinct "worlds," but while there have been recent criticisms of two-standpoint approaches,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup> McCarty's is the first recent attempt to offer a sustained articulation  and defense of a two-world view.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In terms of articulating Kant's psychologically determinist account of action, McCarty's presentation of his account is  clear, consistent, and original, but incomplete and insufficiently defended. In itself, incompleteness is hardly an objection; one can cover only so  much in a single monograph. But the account is incomplete in two crucial ways that undermine the extent to which it solves the problem of justification and explanation. For McCarty, actions are justified by practical syllogisms  that move from maxims through judgments to motives that dictate the goodness  of particular courses of action. And actions are explained by incentives  that give maxims psychological force. But McCarty offers no account of the origin  of one's maxims or the basis for the incorporation of incentives into those maxims. McCarty might say that maxims and their relative strengths are  just basic facts about one's empirical character, explicable only in terms of  one's intelligible character.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup>  Or he might say that there is an empirical story to be told, perhaps a conjunction  of genetics, education, and other circumstances, but that he simply did not  push his explanations back that far. In either case, McCarty seems unable to  solve the (strong) problem of justification and explanation. Either one's  actions are left ultimately unexplained (the first case) or the explanation is  merely natural and not justificatory (the second case). (I would add  that I think that Kant <i style="">does</i> give much more empirical detail here;<sup><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[7]</span></span></a></sup>  yet because I don't think Kant wants to solve the <i style="">strong</i> problem of justification and explanation, this isn't a problem for Kant,  though it is for McCarty.)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In addition to being insufficient in crucial  respects, McCarty's version of Kant's empirical psychology, especially the role of maxims, is thinly defended. McCarty's interpretation of maxims is based  on assimilating Kant and Christian Wolff on the grounds that Kant neither criticized Wolff nor laid out his own alternative account, so "it . . . seems most likely that Kant assumed maxims were already well enough  understood . . . through Wolff" (6). But many of Kant's key differences with Wolff revolved precisely around Wolff's conflation of desire with cognition  (see e.g. <i style="">Kant's Lectures on Metaphysics</i>, 28:261-2), so it would have been reasonable for Kant <i style="">not</i>  to see desire -- even higher desires -- as cognitions of something "as good." Moreover, the way McCarty describes maxims as being of the form "X is good" makes it difficult to see how the categorical imperative evaluates the <i style="">form</i> but not <i style="">matter</i> of maxims. For me, at least, seeing maxims as practical principles of the form "in situation S, do A for purpose P" makes this clearer.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[8]</span></span></a></sup> And there is as much historical basis for conceiving of maxims as  general practical principles or rules of thumb as for reading them in a strictly Wolffian way.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[9]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">McCarty's second main task in the book is the  defense of a two-world metaphysics, which involves attacking two-standpoint  theories and articulating his positive theory. McCarty offers dozens of various  attacks on two-standpoint theories, some of which strike me as important, but most  of which seem to be deeply uncharitable and generally to miss the point of  the views he is attacking. His most important argument -- that  two-standpoint theories fail to solve the problem of justification and explanation --  is just beside the point. The "two standpoints" he's criticizing refer precisely to the two tasks of justification and explanation. Insofar as McCarty's problem is taken in its weak sense, two-standpoint theories  might not give as much detail about the explanations of actions as McCarty does,  but they provide a space for such detail and directly address  action-justification. Insofar as the problem is taken in the strong sense, it is one that two-standpoint theories (rightly, in my view) do not think <i style="">should  be</i> solved, since explanation and justification are precisely two different tasks, assigned to two different standpoints. Similarly,  McCarty seems to deliberately misconstrue two-standpoint theories with respect  to the possibility of causal explanations of action. He insists that  two-standpoint theorists deny psychological determinism, even while admitting -- though  only in a footnote -- that "I do not think that Korsgaard believes that her interpretation . . . rules out psychological determinism" (65n8). With respect to both Korsgaard (65n8) and O'Neill (63), McCarty takes the  claim that we see actions as free and not psychologically determined when  considering them from a practical perspective to imply a denial of psychological  determinism in explanation. But of course, avoiding this implication is precisely what  the two standpoints are supposed to do. And McCarty's complaint that the sense  in which we are free is different than the sense in which we are determined  (65n8, see too 144) applies to his own view, where our noumenal freedom is not  empirically determined.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">McCarty's attacks on two standpoint theories  suffer from having constructed those theories in the least charitable light. His  two-world view, regretfully, risks inviting a similar lack of charity. Those  already sympathetic to two-world accounts will find interesting stands on  several metaphysical issues that can arise once one posits metaphysically  distinct but interacting worlds. But precisely because of the degree of metaphysical  musing in which McCarty indulges, his two-world approach to Kant's  transcendental idealism ends up seeming too much like the metaphysical morass that  drives folks towards alternative approaches to transcendental idealism. For  example, McCarty notes that if human free agents really exist in a noumenal <i style="">world</i>,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[10]</span></span></a></sup> then "all of the substances of an intelligible world . . . affect other substances existing in the world to which they belong by . . .  'determining' differences in their accidents" (113). Strictly speaking, the notion  that one's noumenal properties are determined not only by oneself but by  actions of other (finite) noumenal agents is consistent with Kant's insistence that actions not be determined by any <i style="">prior natural</i> causes. But the idea that my transcendental freedom is  determined by and partly determines the noumenal choices of every other  thing-in-itself is more like the freedom of a turnspit than I thought Kant would have gone  in for. For another example, McCarty argues that, rather than a mere two-fold distinction between phenomenal and noumenal worlds, we need (at least) "three classes of substances or entities": a phenomenal world of appearances, a noumenal world of things in themselves, and a  metaphysically distinct sphere (a world?) in which to place God (119). Again, there's  nothing strictly inconsistent about saying that God does not exist in the noumenal/intelligible world, but it commits Kant to greater metaphysical extravagance than posited by most two-world theorists. Any two-world  theory invites metaphysical speculations about precisely how that world  interacts with the empirical world and about the nature and internal structure of that  world. But McCarty is particularly comfortable making noumenal metaphysical  claims, and his claims end up being less modest and more odd than strictly  necessary. And that is unfortunate, since I think a less metaphysically extravagant version of two-world metaphysics would be a more effective initial  interlocutor in (re)emerging debates about how to interpret Kant's theory of freedom.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">While many of McCarty's metaphysical  speculations about the noumenal world are, at least in my experience, pretty idiosyncratic,  he exhibits one common tendency of two-world theories, a tendency that  drives an unnecessarily sharp wedge between two-world and two-standpoint  approaches to Kant. The tendency comes from what one might see as an inevitable  illusion associated with talking about timeless causation, an illusion due to the  fact that categories, though in principle applicable to things-in-themselves,  are typically and illegitimately applied thereto in schematized ways. Thus  when applying "causation" to relations between noumena and phenomena, one almost cannot help but speak about this causation in <i style="">temporal  terms</i>. This causes much trouble, not least because McCarty, like many advocates of two-world readings of Kant,  illegitimately tends to read noumenal action as having occurred <i style="">in the past</i>.  Thus McCarty uses phrases like "we <i style="">have</i> freely chos<i style="">en</i> the characters we <i style="">now</i> portray in the empirical world" (xxiii, my emphasis) or, in his  important "allegory of the play," that "all their causally determined choices made onstage will depend ultimately on their <i style="">preliminary</i>  free choices made offstage" (153, my emphasis, see too pp. 74, 78, 116, 159 for other examples).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The impact of importing past-tense temporal  language into descriptions of noumenal agency can be seen simply by changing the tense  of the above quotations to the present: "we freely <i style="">choose</i> the  characters we now portray in the empirical world" and "all causally determined choices made onstage depend ultimately on free choices made offstage." Given that temporal categories do not strictly apply to relations between noumena and phenomena, there is no  reason that these present-tense sentences should be seen as any less adequate  ways of describing the relationship between the noumenal and phenomenal worlds  than McCarty's past-tense versions.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[11]</span></span></a></sup>  But phrased in the present-tense, these sentences could also be endorsed by  two-standpoint theorists, who would simply add to McCarty's metaphysically loaded  picture the important point that from within the "off-stage" standpoint of deliberation, when actually deciding what to do, we do not see ourselves  as determined by pre-given influences, but as determined by a character  that <i style="">is</i> -- not merely was -- up to us. So the practical standpoint is the noumenal standpoint, understood properly as timeless and thus ever-present.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[12]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Understood in this way, what McCarty -- along  with careful two-standpoint theories -- rightly emphasizes is something all  too easy to forget. Noumenal choice -- however metaphysically loaded one  construes it -- is not primarily choice of particular actions, but choice of how  empirical incentives operative in a given moment express themselves in one's  actions. Freedom is freedom to choose <i style="">character</i>, and only derivatively freedom to choose particular actions. For helping  to highlight that important point, and for taking some first steps in  opening discussions of Kant's empirical psychology, we owe Richard McCarty  gratitude.</p>

Nonetheless, I think the most widespread  view among contemporary Kantians is that Kant does allow that there is an  empirical, psychologically-determinist account of action, but that it is his  account of action from a practical perspective that is more interesting and more  worthy of study.

There may be some contexts in which the  past tense seems more natural and more consistent with Kant. Kant's  discussion of the problem posed by radical evil -- that since we <i style="">have</i>  chosen to subordinate moral to non-moral incentives, we are stuck with that choice -- seems to be a prime example. Even here,  though, I think that Kant's theory actually fits with present-tense language  better than with past-tense language (even when he uses past-tense language). In particular, it is really because we <i style="">do </i>(now)<i style="">  </i>choose to subordinate moral to non-moral incentives that we cannot now also choose to reverse that  choice. And given our past evil actions, we cannot now choose to have a character  that <i style="">consistently</i> chooses in accordance with the moral law. But we can, now, choose to have either a character that  chooses badly and then gets worse and worse, or one that chooses badly and then  stays the same, or one that chooses badly and then gets better.
