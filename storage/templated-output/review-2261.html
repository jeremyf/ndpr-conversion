<p class="MsoBodyText">The phrase "ethics of history" is intrinsically polyvalent, and the editors of this volume acknowledge the "novelty and ambiguity" of the juxtaposition of ethics with history. (vii)<span style="">  </span>No one can be insensitive to the importance of the considerations entailed, least of all practicing historians or philosophers of history.<span style="">  </span>Hence the organization of a conference on this theme in 1998, from which the essays have been culled, made eminent sense.<span style="">  </span>What remains is to consider what sense the essays have made of the theme.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The volume is organized in three parts, reflecting the commonalities the editors could find among the contributions.<span style="">  </span>The first part is entitled "Historical Representation," articulating what the editors perceive as a ubiquitous "critique" of the conventional notion of historical representation.<span style="">  </span>This "critique" is animated, they believe, by a recognition first of an "unbridgeable" gap between the historian and the past, and hence as well of the inescapable impact of the subjectivity of the historian in the (re)construction.<span style="">  </span>Such subjectivity has, they continue, not only aesthetic but also ethical dimensions (viii-ix).<span style="">  </span>Not unreasonably, the editors take these commonalities for a general endorsement of postmodernist insight.<span style="">  </span>Hence the second part of the volume expounds "Postmodernist Challenges" (to conventional historical representation).<span style="">  </span>Working through these challenges ushers in the closing part, on "History and Responsibility," which proposes to harvest the insights into the "ethics of history."<span style="">  </span>The volume ends, however, with some reservations expressed by David Carr regarding the postmodernist assimilation of history to fiction.<span style="">  </span>He finds in the postmodern position "a number of confusions and untenable tacit assumptions concerning the nature of fiction, the role of imagination in knowledge, and the relation between narrative and historical reality." (259)<span style="">  </span>Not only do I find Carr's comments apt, but I suspect as well that they could serve to turn the whole discussion in a different direction.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">To assess the volume, I suggest we distinguish at least heuristically between "cognitive virtues" and cultural responsibility.<span style="">  </span>This may parallel, in some measure, J<span style=";font-family:&quot;;" >ü</span>rgen R<span style=";font-family:&quot;;" >ü</span>sen's proposal to discriminate "theoretical" from "practical" truth (196).<span style="">  </span>My meaning is that one central way of construing the "ethics of history" is in terms of the historian's obligation to "get it right," that is, to adhere to some standard of "truth-telling."<span style="">  </span>Allan Megill takes the strongest stance along these lines in the volume, arguing that "the epistemology of historical investigation is closely connected to the ethics of historical investigation" (46), and concluding: "The fundamental obligation of historians is to the maximal telling of truth, maximally keyed to the weight of the available evidence.<span style="">  </span>Here is where the only ethics of history worthy of the name is to be found." (66)<span style="">  </span>But there is another -- more conventionally "moral" -- sense, which strongly pervades the volume, of cultural responsibility -- to the past, to the present, and even to the future.<span style="">  </span>R<span style=";font-family:&quot;;" >ü</span>sen puts it clearly: "To whom is the historian responsible and for what?<span style="">  </span>And how are these values and this responsibility effective in the historical work?" (196)<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In terms of historical practice, as Megill puts it, "the obligation to offer reasons for one's truth-claims is an ethical and not merely a technical obligation." (55) Of course, the issue is what <i>kinds</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of truth-claims historians can make and </span><i>how</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> they can offers reasons for them.<span style="">  </span>Megill is confident that there are well-established "rules for arriving at historical truth." (48)<span style="">  </span>In at least some measure, R</span><span style=";font-family:&quot;;" >ü</span>sen seems to share this view and even to extend it toward what seems quite <i>non</i><span style="font-style: normal;">-postmodern, namely the old "value-free" notion of "scientific" objectivity.<span style="">  </span>I think things are considerably more problematic.<span style="">  </span>Here, precisely, the challenges posed by Frank Ankersmit, Edith Wyschogrod and Joseph Margolis to conventional historical representation need to be taken up, especially in terms of the ethical and epistemological meanings of "historical truth."<span style="">  </span>That term throngs Ankersmit's essay obtrusively notwithstanding what seems to me his failure to define it.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, I suspect it is incongruous with his long-established theory of historical representation, which he here reiterates.<span style="">  </span>It is not clear that Ankersmit succeeds in explaining "why truth and value can come so infinitesimally close to each other in the practice of historical writing" (18) except in the sense that both are derived from the </span><i>aesthetic</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of representation.<span style="">  </span>To write "in praise of subjectivity" on this line, hitching both ethics and truth in history to the aesthetic form of representation, leaves one skeptical as to whether "we will go to the heart of reality with representation" (13), or simply express idiosyncratic visions.<span style="">  </span>Edith Wyschogrod, taking up Foucault, affirms an "ideal of historical truth" while abandoning representation altogether.<span style="">  </span>Her "heterological history" is a form of fiction, but fiction is a very sophisticated form in poststructuralist hands.<span style="">  </span>In any event the old idea of representation (narratives of "before and after") is foreclosed by the "atomic" isolation of past "discursive regimes" (Foucault), since the ruptures between them are unbridgeable in principle. She acknowledges such a view "can lead to a metaphysics of unamended difference and dissemination" (41), but she insists there are sufficient "constraints on what can be said or shown" (42) to preempt this </span><i>mise en ab</i><span style=";font-family:&quot;;" ></span><i>îme</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>It is ethical responsibility, "liability for the Other" (30), which raises these constraining demands, reasserting "before and after" as an "imperative" to take up the sufferings of past others.<span style="">  </span>It is the historian's "erotic" passion for the claims of memory (of the Other) which encodes ethics into history.<span style="">   </span>In Foucault's formulation:<span style="">  </span>"'Whose truth is being told, to whom, by whom and to what end?'" (42)<span style="">  </span>Most interesting is Joseph Margolis, who argues at one and the same time that, in a post-positivist philosophical order, there can only be "constructivism all the way down" (175, 184) and yet neither intelligibility nor responsibility need be forsaken.<span style="">  </span>If there is a "dampening [of] objectivity" (195) which appears "inescapably relativistic" (186), this seems to Margolis largely a matter of time: "Conviction tends to outstrip legitimation at any moment; but, over time and well after the fact, the two are more closely reconciled.<span style="">  </span>This often requires the rewriting of history and the reassessment of norms." (188)<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">How does that square with the other concern: the historian's cultural responsibility -- to the past, the present and the future?<span style="">  </span>As John Caputo puts it, "history and justice come too late for the dead." (92) Belated "reconciliation" buys into the fatal compromise of all theodicy; it fails to face squarely the irredeemability of loss.<span style="">  </span>That is what makes acute for several of the authors in the collection Arthur Danto's unanswered question: "have we some kind of duty to the past itself to find out its truth?" (82) And should that duty be, as Caputo follows Benjamin and Levinas in suggesting, to undertake the (impossible) redemption of past suffering?<span style="">  </span>Caputo draws richly on Levinas to explore this impossible obligation, which also lies at the heart of Wyschogrod's reflections.<span style="">  </span>In a way, what seems to flow from the anguished reflections in their essays, along with more measured echoes in Danto and R<span style=";font-family:&quot;;" >ü</span>sen, is the notion that the "irreparability of the past" must be juxtaposed to the "open-endedness of the future" (115) in an effort to provide orientation in the present (R<span style=";font-family:&quot;;" >ü</span>sen's key idea of <i>Orientierungsbed</i><span style=";font-family:&quot;;" ><span style="font-style: italic;">ü</span></span><i>rfnisse</i><span style="font-style: normal;">).<span style="">  </span>Megill puts this emphatically: historians are "obliged to reflect on the ethical significance of the past for us, now," (54) a "relation<span style="">  </span>. . .<span style="">  </span>primarily to . . .<span style="">  </span>the </span><i>continuing</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> present." (61) Rudolf Makkreel reinvokes the larger tradition of philosophy of history from Kant, arguing that "only an </span><i>authentic</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> moral theodicy that is rooted in our moral compass can orient us towards the future," hence the historian's hermeneutic obligation to "make as much sense of history as is needed to keep moral hope alive." (218) But does </span><i>ought</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> imply </span><i>can</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, here?<span style="">  </span>And is the practicing historian really in the business of theodicy?</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The notion of an "ethics of history" comes out of this collection as problematic as its overture foretold.<span style="">  </span>Though for somewhat different reasons, I think Ankersmit's claim that in historical writing truth and value are utterly commingled seems essential.<span style="">  </span>After all these essays, it is still not clear how to resolve what Steven Crowell once called the "mixed messages" of historical writing.<span style="">  </span>(<i>History and Theory</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 37 (1998))<span style="">  </span>Makkreel's suggestion that we should consider with more discrimination the relation between the "reflective" and the "reflexive," between "responsiveness" to the ambiguities of the historical object and the "responsibility" of the historian to the ethical imperatives of the present, proposes more than etymological kinships.<span style="">  </span>"Whereas reflection leads consciousness outside itself, the reflexive allows consciousness to relate to itself." (223) Bringing hermeneutics and history together, Makkreel suggests that "hermeneutics requires an ethic of responsiveness to one's subject matter, whereas history requires an ethic of responsibility."<span style="">  </span>(228) Authenticity requires that however "theoretically indeterminate" a historical judgment may have to be, the historian must show a "determinate practical consciousness." (218)<span style="">  </span>That path seems to hold promise for further exploration.<span style="">  </span></span></p>
