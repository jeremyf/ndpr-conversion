content: "<p>Alan Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Richard Rorty</i> is an introduction to the work of the philosopher of its title, one on whom the titles bestowed include \xE2\x80\x9Cmost interesting philosopher in the world\xE2\x80\x9D (Harold Bloom) and \xE2\x80\x9CThe Professor of Complacence\xE2\x80\x9D (Simon Blackburn). Malachowski is firmly in the Bloom camp; his book is \xE2\x80\x9Cwritten on the premise\xE2\x80\x9D that Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work may constitute a \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99quantum leap\xE2\x80\x99 in philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (9). As a result, his introduction maintains the heady sense of being in on something that characterizes much of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s own work. However, his characterization of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s project is largely a result of an emphasis on views that smack of irrationalism, ones that Rorty has (thankfully) largely come to reject. While acknowledging Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s development would allow for an exposition of his work that addressed the worries of his critics, Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s reading leads him to dismiss these critics (e.g., as akin to \xE2\x80\x9Csolid, soulless critics of progressive music\xE2\x80\x9D (163)). That said, Malachowski claims to present only a \xE2\x80\x9C<i>particular</i> Rorty\xE2\x80\x9D (10) and he does so in a book that is both clear exposition and spirited defense.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s account is \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99comprehensive\xE2\x80\x99 in that it deals with texts spanning the whole\xE2\x80\x9D of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s career (10). The book\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cnarrative\xE2\x80\x9D (as opposed to a \xE2\x80\x9Ctopical\xE2\x80\x9D) approach allows the central themes of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s writing to emerge in the context of the works in which they were formulated. Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s first chapter, \xE2\x80\x9CPlatonic yearnings,\xE2\x80\x9D begins with a discussion of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s brief intellectual autobiography, \xE2\x80\x9CTrotsky and the Wild Orchids.\xE2\x80\x9D Rorty came to philosophy in search of an \xE2\x80\x9Cintellectual or aesthetic framework\xE2\x80\x9D that would exhibit the consistency of his aesthetic values (the \xE2\x80\x9Corchids\xE2\x80\x9D) and his ethical values. Having become convinced of philosophers\xE2\x80\x99 inability to provide non-circular justification of their views, Rorty considered his search a failure. Without a nongainsayable foundation, Rorty concluded, philosophy is ultimately \xE2\x80\x9Ca matter of out-describing the last philosopher.\xE2\x80\x9D While philosophy as practiced since Plato is a failure, the skills associated with it may be put to good use: they can be used to \xE2\x80\x9Cweave the conceptual fabric of a freer, better, more just society\xE2\x80\x9D (27).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Now, Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s rejection of philosophy since Plato appears more than a little hasty. One would be hard-pressed to find any contemporary philosophers who take themselves to be involved in a search for \xE2\x80\x9Cnongainsayable foundations.\xE2\x80\x9D Even so, Rorty thinks that the search for such foundations is somehow implicit in the tradition of which these philosophers are part. Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s second chapter, \xE2\x80\x9CConversation,\xE2\x80\x9D explains that <i>Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</i> is Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s attempt to show that this is so. Malachowski provides a clear account as to how Rorty, through that book\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Geistesgeschichte</i> of modernity, argues that the representationalism that characterizes the philosophical tradition leads to the search for nongainsayable foundations. In Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s perspicuous formulation, Rorty shows that traditional philosophical concerns with knowledge and mind are \xE2\x80\x9Cproblematic\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x9Cin the sense that they are pragmatically unfruitful\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 and \xE2\x80\x9Coptional\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 in that they are a product of assumptions that, while deeply imbedded, are not rationally \xE2\x80\x9Cinevitable\xE2\x80\x9D (38).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In his third chapter, \xE2\x80\x9CPragmatism,\xE2\x80\x9D Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s discusses Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views on the realism- antirealism debate and the nature of truth, as well as his appropriation of Dewey and other philosophers, as presented in <i>The Consequences of Pragmatism</i>. Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity</i> is the main focus of the following chapters, \xE2\x80\x9CContingency\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CLiberalism.\xE2\x80\x9D In his discussion of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s notion of contingency, Malachowski points out that the fact that a problem is contingent (in that it\xE2\x80\x99s dictated not by the nature of reason or some such) does not imply that the problem ought to be abandoned. His use of the distinction between hypothetical and absolute necessity is helpful here. While Rorty sometimes writes as though philosophers think confrontation of, say, the Problem of Free Will is \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolutely necessary\xE2\x80\x9D (dictated by the nature of reason), it is more plausible to suppose that they regard it as a \xE2\x80\x9Chypothetical necessity\xE2\x80\x9D (given our firmly entrenched \xE2\x80\x93 though contingent \xE2\x80\x93 concerns, this is a problem we must face). Why then <i>should</i> we turn away from these problems, even if we <i>may</i> do so? Malachowski tells us that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe combination of a lack of historical progress and the internal tensions\xE2\x80\x9D that characterize our attempts to solve these problems leads Rorty to suggest that we \xE2\x80\x9Ctake a crack at something else\xE2\x80\x9D (115). While Rorty does sometimes talk like this, at other times he offers a potentially more compelling reason: the vocabulary that produced these problems should be superseded by one \xE2\x80\x9Cbetter suited for the preservation and progress of democratic societies\xE2\x80\x9D (109). Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s account of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s discussions of contingency and liberalism would be strengthened were it to explain and evaluate this reason more fully.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I claimed above that Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s critics will find little here to persuade them; there is an important sense in which Malachowski would be unperturbed by this result. He decries what he calls the \xE2\x80\x9Chyper-critical approach\xE2\x80\x9D characteristic of mainstream Anglo-American philosophy and claims that Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work should be approached from \xE2\x80\x9Can initially sympathetic vantage point\xE2\x80\x9D (7). But if this admonition is to amount to anything beyond the obvious, will it not constitute a kind of \xE2\x80\x9Cspecial pleading\xE2\x80\x9D? It won\xE2\x80\x99t, Malachowski says, because such sympathy is made necessary by the fact that \xE2\x80\x9CRorty is attempting to launch philosophy on a path that takes it into new territory incommensurable with present-day \xE2\x80\x98hyper-critical philosophy\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D (7). But incommensurability cannot be a reason for sympathy \xE2\x80\x93 in fact, it seems to render sympathy by definition impossible. Malachowski is right that a list of philosophers will reject the possibility of such \xE2\x80\x9Cnew territory,\xE2\x80\x9D but not, as he says, because they believe their \xE2\x80\x9Cmethods have universal jurisdiction\xE2\x80\x9D (whatever that may be), but because they follow Davidson in his rejection of conceptual schemes. But if that\xE2\x80\x99s so, this list should include Rorty himself. It seems, then, that \xE2\x80\x9Cincommensurability\xE2\x80\x9D does not insulate Rorty from criticism in the way Malachowski suggests it does.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski contends that to take the \xE2\x80\x9Chyper-critics\xE2\x80\x9D seriously would be to push Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s innovations \xE2\x80\x9Cback into the dusty bottle of conventional standards\xE2\x80\x9D (10). There may be an interesting point lurking here concerning the propriety of norms (one would not, for example, be warranted in rejecting a theorem of theoretical physics because it would make bad poetry), but Malachowski does not pursue it. For it sometimes seems as though he considers <i>any</i> standard by which Rorty might be effectively criticized \xE2\x80\x9Cconventional.\xE2\x80\x9D He calls \xE2\x80\x9Csmall-minded\xE2\x80\x9D those critics who think that a \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99contradiction\xE2\x80\x99 or anomaly\xE2\x80\x9D in Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work would cause \xE2\x80\x9Chis whole pragmatist sky [to] fall in\xE2\x80\x9D (28). But he later says that his critics are unable \xE2\x80\x9Cto state their denial in terms that do not beg the question or tacitly assume what Rorty himself denies\xE2\x80\x9D (168). But if criticisms that point to an inconsistency among propositions Rorty accepts are inadmissible <i>and</i> criticisms that point to an inconsistency between a proposition Rorty accepts and other propositions which he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t accept (but which the objector thinks are true) are inadmissible, then no criticisms are admissible.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>It seems Malachowski ought to admit that if Rorty is, in fact, committed to a contradiction, then the \xE2\x80\x9Csky\xE2\x80\x9D in question does indeed \xE2\x80\x9Cfall in.\xE2\x80\x9D He should also indicate that there is little reason to think his views are, in fact, inconsistent. Further, the fact that critics often \xE2\x80\x9Ctacitly assume what Rorty himself denies\xE2\x80\x9D is cold comfort: the same might be said of those who criticize radical skeptics, flat-earthers, or convinced Nazis. And Rorty himself has argued (famously, in the case of the Nazi: see the introduction to <i>CP</i>) that the absence of a non-circular argument against such positions provides no reason to doubt one\xE2\x80\x99s warrant in denying them.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This book is generally dismissive of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s critics \xE2\x80\x93 they most often \xE2\x80\x9Csimply fail to understand what he is trying to do\xE2\x80\x9D (163). What they fail to realize, apparently, is that \xE2\x80\x9CRorty\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x98claims\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\xA6 are not designed to instill a fresh set of beliefs derived from the literal content of the statements they encapsulate.\xE2\x80\x9D That is, Malachowski thinks Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x98claims\xE2\x80\x99 are not <i>claims</i> at all. They are rather attempts \xE2\x80\x9Cto <i>prod</i> us, by way of \xE2\x80\x98edification\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\xA6 into exploring fresh ways of describing things.\xE2\x80\x9D His statements function simply on a \xE2\x80\x9C<i>performative</i> level\xE2\x80\x9D (20). Under the heading \xE2\x80\x9CPhilosophical propaganda,\xE2\x80\x9D Malachowski likens Rorty to \xE2\x80\x9CMadhyamika philosophy,\xE2\x80\x9D saying that</p>  \t\t <blockquote>Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views, and hence his \xE2\x80\x98position-free position,\xE2\x80\x99 are \xE2\x80\x98edifyingly\xE2\x80\x99 presented \xE2\x80\x98to achieve an effect,\xE2\x80\x99 that they should not be \xE2\x80\x98tastelessly\xE2\x80\x99 interpreted as further, if oblique and controversial, contributions to philosophy\xE2\x80\x99s age-old quest for the final, truthful picture of reality. (22)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>According to Malachowski, then, Rorty makes no claims to truth; he simply offers redescriptions in an effort \xE2\x80\x9Cto achieve an effect.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Now, it is undeniable that Rorty has endorsed such views. (Malachowski quotes bizarre passages in PMN to show that this is so.) But it is also undeniable that Rorty comes to reject this understanding of his project. In \xE2\x80\x9CCharles Taylor on Truth,\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"1b\" href=\"#1\">1</a></sup> Rorty says that PMN was marked by an unhappy tendency to make existentialist noises,\xE2\x80\x9D one that resulted from a prior tendency to make</p>  \t\t <blockquote>the unhappy distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cdemonstrating that previous philosophers were mistaken\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Coffering redescriptions in an alternative language\xE2\x80\x9D instead of briskly saying that to say that one\xE2\x80\x99s predecessors used a bad language is just to say that they made a certain kind of mistake. (TP 92)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>But it becomes evident that Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s endorsement of this \xE2\x80\x9Cunhappy distinction\xE2\x80\x9D on Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s behalf is central to his interpretation of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work. To be sure we don\xE2\x80\x99t miss the point, Rorty adds: \xE2\x80\x9CI am also happy to say that when I put forward large philosophical views I am making \xE2\x80\x98claims to truth\xE2\x80\x99 rather than simply a recommendation to speak differently\xE2\x80\x9D (TP 92). Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s failure to account for the changes in Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views over the years leaves him defending positions Rorty was right to leave behind.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This failure causes Malachowski to interpret Rorty as being far more suspicious of argument than the above quotes suggest. For instance, he assures us that Rorty \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes not believe there is anything wrong with arguments as such\xE2\x80\x9D (43); this is, of course, anything but reassuring. Why say this? Because Malachowski takes Rorty to regard as important the fact that \xE2\x80\x9Cpractices, customs, habits, and conventions\xE2\x80\x9D play a role in determining a person\xE2\x80\x99s beliefs. Why is this obvious fact significant? Because, he says, many philosophers deny it: though they may not admit it, they believe the following:</p>  \t\t <blockquote>When philosophers believe something philosophically significant (say P) they believe it <i>because it is true</i> (and for no other reason). When, over time, they \xE2\x80\x93 or their successors \xE2\x80\x93 change their minds and come to believe Q instead (where Q now obviously implies that P is false) it is again <i>the truth of</i> Q that does the persuasive work: they come to believe Q because <i>it</i> is true (and for no other reason) (53)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>While Malachowski attributes this position to Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s critics, the principle of charity mitigates against attributing this position to anyone, since it\xE2\x80\x99s not simply false, it\xE2\x80\x99s incoherent: one cannot believe P \xE2\x80\x9C<i>because it is true</i>\xE2\x80\x9D if, in fact, P is not true. At most, one could believe P because one thinks (possibly falsely) that it is true. But this too makes little sense, since to think that P is true just is to believe P, and cannot thereby serve as a reason for (or a cause of) the latter. These concerns aside, the notion that many (most?) philosophers hold that the truth of P can serve as a reason for the belief that P is far-fetched at best. To hold such a position would be to think that when asked \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy do you believe P?\xE2\x80\x9D a perfectly good answer is \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause P is true.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski rightly claims that Rorty does not take his rejection of metaphysical realism to imply the rejection of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe vocabulary of critical assessment,\xE2\x80\x9D including the distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is accurate\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is inaccurate\xE2\x80\x9D (5). However, Malachowski goes on to argue that such distinctions must be made according to \xE2\x80\x9C<i>pragmatic</i> criteria.\xE2\x80\x9D As an example of what he means, he claims that one account may be judged to be more accurate than another \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause it more effectively satisfies certain desires or fulfils such and such a purpose\xE2\x80\x9D (5). But something has gone wrong here. Imagine a scenario in which my wife and I are trying to determine how a vase in our house was broken. She suggests that our daughter Emma might have knocked it over this afternoon, and I disagree. If she asks me, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy is that account inaccurate?\xE2\x80\x9D I may respond \xE2\x80\x9CBecause Emma was with me at the bookstore when the vase was broken.\xE2\x80\x9D If, however, I respond, \xE2\x80\x9CBecause your account isn\xE2\x80\x99t very useful,\xE2\x80\x9D then I would deserve her puzzled look. That answer is no more appropriate than \xE2\x80\x9CBecause it fails to represent the nature of reality as it exists independent of human concerns\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CBecause it <i>is</i> inaccurate.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I take this to show that the language of critical assessment is tied no more to a pragmatic theory of truth than it is to metaphysical realism. To think otherwise is to fail to recognize the significance of the distinction between the first-person and third-person perspectives. To see this, imagine that I relate the above conversation with my wife to a student interested in questions about the nature of truth. If, as we discuss the nature of truth, I am to ask the student, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy is that account inaccurate?\xE2\x80\x9D she might well respond, \xE2\x80\x9CBecause it isn\xE2\x80\x99t very useful\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CBecause it fails to represent the nature reality as it exists independent of human concerns.\xE2\x80\x9D When we take up her perspective \xE2\x80\x93 not that of an inquirer trying to figure out who broke the vase, but of a third-person reflection on the inquiry \xE2\x80\x93 it becomes appropriate to offer theories of truth. As we saw above, however, to do so from the first-person perspective would be nonsensical \xE2\x80\x93 to think otherwise would be to regard \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause it fails to represent the nature of reality\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause it is useful\xE2\x80\x9D as justifications for a belief. The first-person perspective presupposes only what Gary Gutting calls \xE2\x80\x9Chumdrum realism\xE2\x80\x9D or what Arthur Fine calls \xE2\x80\x9Cthe natural ontological attitude.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> Metaphysical realism and the pragmatic theory of truth are at home only in the third-person perspective; that is, only when one takes up a standpoint outside that of the engaged inquirer, the perspective of theory or explanation.<sup><a name=\"3b\" href=\"#3\">3</a></sup> While Malachowski recognizes at one point that pragmatism and metaphysical realism function at the level of \xE2\x80\x9Cexplanation\xE2\x80\x9D (81), this recognition is not pervasive. Rorty \xE2\x80\x93 by his own best lights \xE2\x80\x93 can and should use the language of critical assessment without notions like \xE2\x80\x9Cusefulness\xE2\x80\x9D or talk of \xE2\x80\x9Ccoping.\xE2\x80\x9D Such notions are appropriate only when he takes up the third-person perspective. While Fine and Gutting might counsel him to eschew the third-person perspective on truth, Rorty regards it as crucial to the realization of a liberal utopia that</p>  \t\t <blockquote>the image of thoughts or words answering to the world \xE2\x80\xA6 be replaced by images of organisms coping with their environment by using language to develop projects of social cooperation. (RC 263)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s efforts would be better spent were he to explain why Rorty think this is so and whether his position has any merit. His failure to do so leads him to call Simon Blackburn\xE2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe <i>rejection</i> of questions [is] the distinctive theme of what [Rorty] calls pragmatism\xE2\x80\x9D a \xE2\x80\x9Csilly accusation\xE2\x80\x9D (141). In fact, this is neither silly nor an accusation. Insofar as Rorty is committed to maintaining a first-person perspective, he will reject the many philosophical questions \xE2\x80\x93 especially those about the nature of truth \xE2\x80\x93that arise only from a third-person perspective.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Lack of attention to these perspectives is one reason that Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s critics is unsatisfying. For example, Thomas Nagel says that Rorty seems to be able to modify his beliefs, not due to the force of argument, but \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause it might make life more amusing \xE2\x80\xA6 less cluttered with annoying problems\xE2\x80\x9D (164) \xE2\x80\x93 that is, because doing so would be useful. If Rorty (or his readers) do sometimes confuse the first and third-person perspectives, Nagel\xE2\x80\x99s attitude is not inexplicable. To Nagel\xE2\x80\x99s request for arguments for Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views, however, Malachowski states that anyone who understands Rorty will see no reason to offer arguments, since \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphors, images, and all sorts of historical contingencies\xE2\x80\x9D are better explanations of intellectual change (166). But even if this account of intellectual change is accurate, only a confusion of the explanatory with the justificatory would lead one to eschew arguments in favor of \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphors and images.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s emphasis on views Rorty came to reject makes the resulting position less plausible than it ought to be. When he decides against what could have been a helpful discussion of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views on science, he imputes to Rorty the claim that to say that \xE2\x80\x9Cscience captur[es] the truth about the world\xE2\x80\x9D is \xE2\x80\x9Cno more intellectually justified than the rhetorical pats on the back modern politicians tend to award themselves\xE2\x80\x9D (16). He quotes approvingly Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s statement that truth is \xE2\x80\x9Ca compliment paid to sentences that seem to be paying their way and that fit in with other sentences that do so,\xE2\x80\x9D and attributes to Rorty a position he calls \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatism without truth\xE2\x80\x9D (73). While these statements may reflect views Rorty held at one time, they are among the views we have reason to think Rorty includes among the \xE2\x80\x9Cdumb things\xE2\x80\x9D he \xE2\x80\x9Csaid in the past\xE2\x80\x9D (TP 92). Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s introduction to Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work \xE2\x80\x93 with its fine discussions of contingency, liberalism, and its subject\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CPlatonic yearnings\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 would have done well to leave them there.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

transformed_content: "<p>Alan Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Richard Rorty</i> is an introduction to the work of the philosopher of its title, one on whom the titles bestowed include \xE2\x80\x9Cmost interesting philosopher in the world\xE2\x80\x9D (Harold Bloom) and \xE2\x80\x9CThe Professor of Complacence\xE2\x80\x9D (Simon Blackburn). Malachowski is firmly in the Bloom camp; his book is \xE2\x80\x9Cwritten on the premise\xE2\x80\x9D that Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work may constitute a \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99quantum leap\xE2\x80\x99 in philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (9). As a result, his introduction maintains the heady sense of being in on something that characterizes much of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s own work. However, his characterization of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s project is largely a result of an emphasis on views that smack of irrationalism, ones that Rorty has (thankfully) largely come to reject. While acknowledging Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s development would allow for an exposition of his work that addressed the worries of his critics, Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s reading leads him to dismiss these critics (e.g., as akin to \xE2\x80\x9Csolid, soulless critics of progressive music\xE2\x80\x9D (163)). That said, Malachowski claims to present only a \xE2\x80\x9C<i>particular</i> Rorty\xE2\x80\x9D (10) and he does so in a book that is both clear exposition and spirited defense.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s account is \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99comprehensive\xE2\x80\x99 in that it deals with texts spanning the whole\xE2\x80\x9D of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s career (10). The book\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cnarrative\xE2\x80\x9D (as opposed to a \xE2\x80\x9Ctopical\xE2\x80\x9D) approach allows the central themes of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s writing to emerge in the context of the works in which they were formulated. Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s first chapter, \xE2\x80\x9CPlatonic yearnings,\xE2\x80\x9D begins with a discussion of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s brief intellectual autobiography, \xE2\x80\x9CTrotsky and the Wild Orchids.\xE2\x80\x9D Rorty came to philosophy in search of an \xE2\x80\x9Cintellectual or aesthetic framework\xE2\x80\x9D that would exhibit the consistency of his aesthetic values (the \xE2\x80\x9Corchids\xE2\x80\x9D) and his ethical values. Having become convinced of philosophers\xE2\x80\x99 inability to provide non-circular justification of their views, Rorty considered his search a failure. Without a nongainsayable foundation, Rorty concluded, philosophy is ultimately \xE2\x80\x9Ca matter of out-describing the last philosopher.\xE2\x80\x9D While philosophy as practiced since Plato is a failure, the skills associated with it may be put to good use: they can be used to \xE2\x80\x9Cweave the conceptual fabric of a freer, better, more just society\xE2\x80\x9D (27).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Now, Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s rejection of philosophy since Plato appears more than a little hasty. One would be hard-pressed to find any contemporary philosophers who take themselves to be involved in a search for \xE2\x80\x9Cnongainsayable foundations.\xE2\x80\x9D Even so, Rorty thinks that the search for such foundations is somehow implicit in the tradition of which these philosophers are part. Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s second chapter, \xE2\x80\x9CConversation,\xE2\x80\x9D explains that <i>Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</i> is Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s attempt to show that this is so. Malachowski provides a clear account as to how Rorty, through that book\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Geistesgeschichte</i> of modernity, argues that the representationalism that characterizes the philosophical tradition leads to the search for nongainsayable foundations. In Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s perspicuous formulation, Rorty shows that traditional philosophical concerns with knowledge and mind are \xE2\x80\x9Cproblematic\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x9Cin the sense that they are pragmatically unfruitful\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 and \xE2\x80\x9Coptional\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 in that they are a product of assumptions that, while deeply imbedded, are not rationally \xE2\x80\x9Cinevitable\xE2\x80\x9D (38).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In his third chapter, \xE2\x80\x9CPragmatism,\xE2\x80\x9D Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s discusses Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views on the realism- antirealism debate and the nature of truth, as well as his appropriation of Dewey and other philosophers, as presented in <i>The Consequences of Pragmatism</i>. Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity</i> is the main focus of the following chapters, \xE2\x80\x9CContingency\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CLiberalism.\xE2\x80\x9D In his discussion of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s notion of contingency, Malachowski points out that the fact that a problem is contingent (in that it\xE2\x80\x99s dictated not by the nature of reason or some such) does not imply that the problem ought to be abandoned. His use of the distinction between hypothetical and absolute necessity is helpful here. While Rorty sometimes writes as though philosophers think confrontation of, say, the Problem of Free Will is \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolutely necessary\xE2\x80\x9D (dictated by the nature of reason), it is more plausible to suppose that they regard it as a \xE2\x80\x9Chypothetical necessity\xE2\x80\x9D (given our firmly entrenched \xE2\x80\x93 though contingent \xE2\x80\x93 concerns, this is a problem we must face). Why then <i>should</i> we turn away from these problems, even if we <i>may</i> do so? Malachowski tells us that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe combination of a lack of historical progress and the internal tensions\xE2\x80\x9D that characterize our attempts to solve these problems leads Rorty to suggest that we \xE2\x80\x9Ctake a crack at something else\xE2\x80\x9D (115). While Rorty does sometimes talk like this, at other times he offers a potentially more compelling reason: the vocabulary that produced these problems should be superseded by one \xE2\x80\x9Cbetter suited for the preservation and progress of democratic societies\xE2\x80\x9D (109). Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s account of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s discussions of contingency and liberalism would be strengthened were it to explain and evaluate this reason more fully.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I claimed above that Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s critics will find little here to persuade them; there is an important sense in which Malachowski would be unperturbed by this result. He decries what he calls the \xE2\x80\x9Chyper-critical approach\xE2\x80\x9D characteristic of mainstream Anglo-American philosophy and claims that Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work should be approached from \xE2\x80\x9Can initially sympathetic vantage point\xE2\x80\x9D (7). But if this admonition is to amount to anything beyond the obvious, will it not constitute a kind of \xE2\x80\x9Cspecial pleading\xE2\x80\x9D? It won\xE2\x80\x99t, Malachowski says, because such sympathy is made necessary by the fact that \xE2\x80\x9CRorty is attempting to launch philosophy on a path that takes it into new territory incommensurable with present-day \xE2\x80\x98hyper-critical philosophy\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D (7). But incommensurability cannot be a reason for sympathy \xE2\x80\x93 in fact, it seems to render sympathy by definition impossible. Malachowski is right that a list of philosophers will reject the possibility of such \xE2\x80\x9Cnew territory,\xE2\x80\x9D but not, as he says, because they believe their \xE2\x80\x9Cmethods have universal jurisdiction\xE2\x80\x9D (whatever that may be), but because they follow Davidson in his rejection of conceptual schemes. But if that\xE2\x80\x99s so, this list should include Rorty himself. It seems, then, that \xE2\x80\x9Cincommensurability\xE2\x80\x9D does not insulate Rorty from criticism in the way Malachowski suggests it does.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski contends that to take the \xE2\x80\x9Chyper-critics\xE2\x80\x9D seriously would be to push Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s innovations \xE2\x80\x9Cback into the dusty bottle of conventional standards\xE2\x80\x9D (10). There may be an interesting point lurking here concerning the propriety of norms (one would not, for example, be warranted in rejecting a theorem of theoretical physics because it would make bad poetry), but Malachowski does not pursue it. For it sometimes seems as though he considers <i>any</i> standard by which Rorty might be effectively criticized \xE2\x80\x9Cconventional.\xE2\x80\x9D He calls \xE2\x80\x9Csmall-minded\xE2\x80\x9D those critics who think that a \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99contradiction\xE2\x80\x99 or anomaly\xE2\x80\x9D in Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work would cause \xE2\x80\x9Chis whole pragmatist sky [to] fall in\xE2\x80\x9D (28). But he later says that his critics are unable \xE2\x80\x9Cto state their denial in terms that do not beg the question or tacitly assume what Rorty himself denies\xE2\x80\x9D (168). But if criticisms that point to an inconsistency among propositions Rorty accepts are inadmissible <i>and</i> criticisms that point to an inconsistency between a proposition Rorty accepts and other propositions which he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t accept (but which the objector thinks are true) are inadmissible, then no criticisms are admissible.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>It seems Malachowski ought to admit that if Rorty is, in fact, committed to a contradiction, then the \xE2\x80\x9Csky\xE2\x80\x9D in question does indeed \xE2\x80\x9Cfall in.\xE2\x80\x9D He should also indicate that there is little reason to think his views are, in fact, inconsistent. Further, the fact that critics often \xE2\x80\x9Ctacitly assume what Rorty himself denies\xE2\x80\x9D is cold comfort: the same might be said of those who criticize radical skeptics, flat-earthers, or convinced Nazis. And Rorty himself has argued (famously, in the case of the Nazi: see the introduction to <i>CP</i>) that the absence of a non-circular argument against such positions provides no reason to doubt one\xE2\x80\x99s warrant in denying them.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This book is generally dismissive of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s critics \xE2\x80\x93 they most often \xE2\x80\x9Csimply fail to understand what he is trying to do\xE2\x80\x9D (163). What they fail to realize, apparently, is that \xE2\x80\x9CRorty\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x98claims\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\xA6 are not designed to instill a fresh set of beliefs derived from the literal content of the statements they encapsulate.\xE2\x80\x9D That is, Malachowski thinks Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x98claims\xE2\x80\x99 are not <i>claims</i> at all. They are rather attempts \xE2\x80\x9Cto <i>prod</i> us, by way of \xE2\x80\x98edification\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\xA6 into exploring fresh ways of describing things.\xE2\x80\x9D His statements function simply on a \xE2\x80\x9C<i>performative</i> level\xE2\x80\x9D (20). Under the heading \xE2\x80\x9CPhilosophical propaganda,\xE2\x80\x9D Malachowski likens Rorty to \xE2\x80\x9CMadhyamika philosophy,\xE2\x80\x9D saying that</p>  \t\t <blockquote>Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views, and hence his \xE2\x80\x98position-free position,\xE2\x80\x99 are \xE2\x80\x98edifyingly\xE2\x80\x99 presented \xE2\x80\x98to achieve an effect,\xE2\x80\x99 that they should not be \xE2\x80\x98tastelessly\xE2\x80\x99 interpreted as further, if oblique and controversial, contributions to philosophy\xE2\x80\x99s age-old quest for the final, truthful picture of reality. (22)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>According to Malachowski, then, Rorty makes no claims to truth; he simply offers redescriptions in an effort \xE2\x80\x9Cto achieve an effect.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Now, it is undeniable that Rorty has endorsed such views. (Malachowski quotes bizarre passages in PMN to show that this is so.) But it is also undeniable that Rorty comes to reject this understanding of his project. In \xE2\x80\x9CCharles Taylor on Truth,\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"1b\" href=\"#1\">1</a></sup> Rorty says that PMN was marked by an unhappy tendency to make existentialist noises,\xE2\x80\x9D one that resulted from a prior tendency to make</p>  \t\t <blockquote>the unhappy distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cdemonstrating that previous philosophers were mistaken\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Coffering redescriptions in an alternative language\xE2\x80\x9D instead of briskly saying that to say that one\xE2\x80\x99s predecessors used a bad language is just to say that they made a certain kind of mistake. (TP 92)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>But it becomes evident that Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s endorsement of this \xE2\x80\x9Cunhappy distinction\xE2\x80\x9D on Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s behalf is central to his interpretation of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work. To be sure we don\xE2\x80\x99t miss the point, Rorty adds: \xE2\x80\x9CI am also happy to say that when I put forward large philosophical views I am making \xE2\x80\x98claims to truth\xE2\x80\x99 rather than simply a recommendation to speak differently\xE2\x80\x9D (TP 92). Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s failure to account for the changes in Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views over the years leaves him defending positions Rorty was right to leave behind.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This failure causes Malachowski to interpret Rorty as being far more suspicious of argument than the above quotes suggest. For instance, he assures us that Rorty \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes not believe there is anything wrong with arguments as such\xE2\x80\x9D (43); this is, of course, anything but reassuring. Why say this? Because Malachowski takes Rorty to regard as important the fact that \xE2\x80\x9Cpractices, customs, habits, and conventions\xE2\x80\x9D play a role in determining a person\xE2\x80\x99s beliefs. Why is this obvious fact significant? Because, he says, many philosophers deny it: though they may not admit it, they believe the following:</p>  \t\t <blockquote>When philosophers believe something philosophically significant (say P) they believe it <i>because it is true</i> (and for no other reason). When, over time, they \xE2\x80\x93 or their successors \xE2\x80\x93 change their minds and come to believe Q instead (where Q now obviously implies that P is false) it is again <i>the truth of</i> Q that does the persuasive work: they come to believe Q because <i>it</i> is true (and for no other reason) (53)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>While Malachowski attributes this position to Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s critics, the principle of charity mitigates against attributing this position to anyone, since it\xE2\x80\x99s not simply false, it\xE2\x80\x99s incoherent: one cannot believe P \xE2\x80\x9C<i>because it is true</i>\xE2\x80\x9D if, in fact, P is not true. At most, one could believe P because one thinks (possibly falsely) that it is true. But this too makes little sense, since to think that P is true just is to believe P, and cannot thereby serve as a reason for (or a cause of) the latter. These concerns aside, the notion that many (most?) philosophers hold that the truth of P can serve as a reason for the belief that P is far-fetched at best. To hold such a position would be to think that when asked \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy do you believe P?\xE2\x80\x9D a perfectly good answer is \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause P is true.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski rightly claims that Rorty does not take his rejection of metaphysical realism to imply the rejection of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe vocabulary of critical assessment,\xE2\x80\x9D including the distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is accurate\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is inaccurate\xE2\x80\x9D (5). However, Malachowski goes on to argue that such distinctions must be made according to \xE2\x80\x9C<i>pragmatic</i> criteria.\xE2\x80\x9D As an example of what he means, he claims that one account may be judged to be more accurate than another \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause it more effectively satisfies certain desires or fulfils such and such a purpose\xE2\x80\x9D (5). But something has gone wrong here. Imagine a scenario in which my wife and I are trying to determine how a vase in our house was broken. She suggests that our daughter Emma might have knocked it over this afternoon, and I disagree. If she asks me, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy is that account inaccurate?\xE2\x80\x9D I may respond \xE2\x80\x9CBecause Emma was with me at the bookstore when the vase was broken.\xE2\x80\x9D If, however, I respond, \xE2\x80\x9CBecause your account isn\xE2\x80\x99t very useful,\xE2\x80\x9D then I would deserve her puzzled look. That answer is no more appropriate than \xE2\x80\x9CBecause it fails to represent the nature of reality as it exists independent of human concerns\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CBecause it <i>is</i> inaccurate.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I take this to show that the language of critical assessment is tied no more to a pragmatic theory of truth than it is to metaphysical realism. To think otherwise is to fail to recognize the significance of the distinction between the first-person and third-person perspectives. To see this, imagine that I relate the above conversation with my wife to a student interested in questions about the nature of truth. If, as we discuss the nature of truth, I am to ask the student, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy is that account inaccurate?\xE2\x80\x9D she might well respond, \xE2\x80\x9CBecause it isn\xE2\x80\x99t very useful\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CBecause it fails to represent the nature reality as it exists independent of human concerns.\xE2\x80\x9D When we take up her perspective \xE2\x80\x93 not that of an inquirer trying to figure out who broke the vase, but of a third-person reflection on the inquiry \xE2\x80\x93 it becomes appropriate to offer theories of truth. As we saw above, however, to do so from the first-person perspective would be nonsensical \xE2\x80\x93 to think otherwise would be to regard \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause it fails to represent the nature of reality\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause it is useful\xE2\x80\x9D as justifications for a belief. The first-person perspective presupposes only what Gary Gutting calls \xE2\x80\x9Chumdrum realism\xE2\x80\x9D or what Arthur Fine calls \xE2\x80\x9Cthe natural ontological attitude.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> Metaphysical realism and the pragmatic theory of truth are at home only in the third-person perspective; that is, only when one takes up a standpoint outside that of the engaged inquirer, the perspective of theory or explanation.<sup><a name=\"3b\" href=\"#3\">3</a></sup> While Malachowski recognizes at one point that pragmatism and metaphysical realism function at the level of \xE2\x80\x9Cexplanation\xE2\x80\x9D (81), this recognition is not pervasive. Rorty \xE2\x80\x93 by his own best lights \xE2\x80\x93 can and should use the language of critical assessment without notions like \xE2\x80\x9Cusefulness\xE2\x80\x9D or talk of \xE2\x80\x9Ccoping.\xE2\x80\x9D Such notions are appropriate only when he takes up the third-person perspective. While Fine and Gutting might counsel him to eschew the third-person perspective on truth, Rorty regards it as crucial to the realization of a liberal utopia that</p>  \t\t <blockquote>the image of thoughts or words answering to the world \xE2\x80\xA6 be replaced by images of organisms coping with their environment by using language to develop projects of social cooperation. (RC 263)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s efforts would be better spent were he to explain why Rorty think this is so and whether his position has any merit. His failure to do so leads him to call Simon Blackburn\xE2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe <i>rejection</i> of questions [is] the distinctive theme of what [Rorty] calls pragmatism\xE2\x80\x9D a \xE2\x80\x9Csilly accusation\xE2\x80\x9D (141). In fact, this is neither silly nor an accusation. Insofar as Rorty is committed to maintaining a first-person perspective, he will reject the many philosophical questions \xE2\x80\x93 especially those about the nature of truth \xE2\x80\x93that arise only from a third-person perspective.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Lack of attention to these perspectives is one reason that Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s critics is unsatisfying. For example, Thomas Nagel says that Rorty seems to be able to modify his beliefs, not due to the force of argument, but \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause it might make life more amusing \xE2\x80\xA6 less cluttered with annoying problems\xE2\x80\x9D (164) \xE2\x80\x93 that is, because doing so would be useful. If Rorty (or his readers) do sometimes confuse the first and third-person perspectives, Nagel\xE2\x80\x99s attitude is not inexplicable. To Nagel\xE2\x80\x99s request for arguments for Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views, however, Malachowski states that anyone who understands Rorty will see no reason to offer arguments, since \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphors, images, and all sorts of historical contingencies\xE2\x80\x9D are better explanations of intellectual change (166). But even if this account of intellectual change is accurate, only a confusion of the explanatory with the justificatory would lead one to eschew arguments in favor of \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphors and images.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s emphasis on views Rorty came to reject makes the resulting position less plausible than it ought to be. When he decides against what could have been a helpful discussion of Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s views on science, he imputes to Rorty the claim that to say that \xE2\x80\x9Cscience captur[es] the truth about the world\xE2\x80\x9D is \xE2\x80\x9Cno more intellectually justified than the rhetorical pats on the back modern politicians tend to award themselves\xE2\x80\x9D (16). He quotes approvingly Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s statement that truth is \xE2\x80\x9Ca compliment paid to sentences that seem to be paying their way and that fit in with other sentences that do so,\xE2\x80\x9D and attributes to Rorty a position he calls \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatism without truth\xE2\x80\x9D (73). While these statements may reflect views Rorty held at one time, they are among the views we have reason to think Rorty includes among the \xE2\x80\x9Cdumb things\xE2\x80\x9D he \xE2\x80\x9Csaid in the past\xE2\x80\x9D (TP 92). Malachowski\xE2\x80\x99s introduction to Rorty\xE2\x80\x99s work \xE2\x80\x93 with its fine discussions of contingency, liberalism, and its subject\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CPlatonic yearnings\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 would have done well to leave them there.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
