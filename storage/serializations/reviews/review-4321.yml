content: "<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Ten papers from a conference on Socrates' <i>daimonion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (Brussels 2003) assess what is known today about that piece of the Socrates puzzle and debate a range of still unsettled issues.<span style=\"\">  </span>The chapters are written by Luc Brisson, Mark L.

Smith, one of this volume's co-editors, was also recently a co-editor of another collection that covered somewhat similar ground: Smith and Paul B. Woodruff (eds.), </span><i>Reason and Religion in Socratic Philosophy</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (Oxford University Press, 2000).<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Impossible to figure out or not, the divine sign is relevant to the larger picture of who Socrates was and what he did.<span style=\"\">  </span>Was the man in fact what moderns call rationalistic?<span style=\"\">  </span>Did his commitment to reason make him an atheist?<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Also: Given that only Socrates appears to have heard a divine signal, did Plato see him as something unique, or was his life instead a possibility available to all humans?<span style=\"\">  </span>(Does one only philosophize with a <i>daimonion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">?)<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">More broadly: Why was Socrates tried and executed?<span style=\"\">  </span>In what way and for what reasons did his experience of his divine sign lead to his conviction and death?<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Because Socrates cannot be understood until his weird voice has been, the first priority is therefore to determine what that voice is and how it works.<span style=\"\">  </span>The ancient testimony is not incomprehensible and not all that contradictory, but it does pose questions that have not yet been treated with the thoroughness they deserve, certainly not given definitive answers.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">For example: What kind of experience was Socrates referring to with words like \"a voice\"?<span style=\"\">  </span>Who sent that message?<span style=\"\">  </span>Did it wear its meaning on its sleeve or did it stand in need of explanation?<span style=\"\">  </span>Is \"No\" all it said?<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">One can grow suspicious too.<span style=\"\">  </span>Why did Plato and Xenophon take special pains to talk about the sign and what it did or didn't say in their respective versions of the trial? Maybe they had thought of Socrates as magically protected by his infallible warning system, only to watch as he stumbled heedless into the viperous courtroom, where the plain talk that had humbled and elated Athenians in the agora merely offended the jurors.<span style=\"\">  </span>Had they been wrong about the sign and was Socrates just an ordinary man?<span style=\"\">  </span>If that anxiety goaded Plato and Xenophon, their complicated appeals to the sign and explanations of why Socrates saw his death sentence as a happy ending may have been after-the-fact rationalizations for the voice's apparent failure.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">These specific questions about the voice and its message occupy the contributors to <i>Socrates' Divine Sign.</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"\">  </span>The eleven authors sift through the available Platonic evidence for new insights about the divine sign, hoping to use what they learn to understand Socrates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">What divides the authors of these articles, as is only appropriate, are the contentious issues surrounding the divine sign -- whether the sign comes from a god or rather speaks from within Socrates; whether it attests to Socrates' uniqueness among humans or on the contrary makes him a paradigm for all others to follow.<span style=\"\">  </span>With plenty of space for the positions on both sides of these debates and others, the collection brings its reader up to date on a thriving and significant discussion.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Perhaps philosophers who do not study ancient philosophy will find the anthology too focused.<span style=\"\">  </span>And despite perennial interest in Socrates, the microsurgery with which the authors dissect these passages almost guarantees that the general reader will not come to the book, or not persevere with it.<span style=\"\">  </span>Still it will have its influence.<span style=\"\">  </span>Almost everyone who teaches Plato and Socrates in college is bound to be operating under assumptions about the <i>daimonion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that articles in this collection challenge.<span style=\"\">  </span>Those scholars ought to read this book; having read it they will surely speak of Socrates in new ways.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is good to have such a book available.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Moreover it is good to know that such a book <i>can</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> come out today, a heartening sign of the times bespeaking welcome change in studies of ancient thought.<span style=\"\">  </span>For thirty years or more the serious assessment of Greek religion has made ancient beliefs and practices look worthier of study than they had been.<span style=\"\">  </span>The names of Walter Burkert and Jean-Pierre Vernant are only the most prominent of many in this enterprise.<span style=\"\">   </span>Still philosophers have a hard time responding to fifth- and fourth-century Athenian thought as other than the work of \"free-thinkers.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>You can blame Thucydides and his role as every modern's guide to the fifth century: Thucydides with his impatience for oracles can make Socrates' Athens seem as atheistical as a philosophy department in America today.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">But Socrates was not a man in the Athenian crowd enslaved by intellectual fashions of the day.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Platonic Socrates talked about hearing and heeding dreams (<i>Apology</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, </span><i>Crito</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, </span><i>Phaedo</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) and about obeying the Delphic oracle (</span><i>Apology, Republic</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">); he spilled wine to Zeus in the </span><i>Symposium.</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"\">  </span>In several other dialogues (</span><i>Ion, Phaedrus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) he attributed poetry to divine inspiration.<span style=\"\">  </span>The voice he heard was part of a life that included divinity, and theories about Socrates will be incomplete if they pretend otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Thus when Thomas Brickhouse and Nicholas Smith refute Gregory Vlastos's reductionist reading of the divine sign -- the voice as a rational hunch -- they are helping to bring a suppressed side of Socrates back into the picture (44-49).<span style=\"\">  </span>Socrates' experience was genuinely religious -- which as Brickhouse and Smith also point out does not make it irrational (61-62).<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Mark McPherran too has worked to expand the prevailing interpretation of Socrates' rationality.<span style=\"\">  </span>It stands to reason that he should be part of this book: He played a major role in the Smith-Woodruff volume, and his own <i>The Religion of Socrates</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1996) argued at length for the compatibility between Socrates' piety and his philosophical enterprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">McPherran is a typical contributor in some ways, for these tend to be widely recognized names in Socrates-studies, knowledgeable and clear-thinking but also imaginative scholars.<span style=\"\">  </span>He stands out in one respect that is worth drawing attention to: He keeps himself apprised of contemporary research into Athenian religion and incorporates his research into his assessment of Socrates.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Although McPherran's book contains the most numerous examples of how he uses knowledge about Greek religion, there are some here too.<span style=\"\">  </span>His article in <i>Socrates' Divine Sign</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> vivifies references to the voice by exploring it as a relationship between Socrates and Apollo (26-30).<span style=\"\">  </span>McPherran juxtaposes Socrates' trust in dreams to the skepticism Aristotle voices in </span><i>On Divination in Sleep</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 464a, to offer some cultural lens through which to see Socrates (13-14).<span style=\"\">  </span>These are hardly detailed inquiries into Greek religion, and yet they exceed what one finds in the book's other articles.<span style=\"\">  </span>Most proceed without reference to how Socrates' contemporaries practiced their religion and especially without reference to what recent research into the subject has discovered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">To put the point another way: It is true that all claims about the Socratic divine sign have to rest on fewer than a dozen passages.<span style=\"\">  </span>But reviewing these few passages can have the effect of excluding questions about the background of classical Athenian religious practice.<span style=\"\">  </span>Only a few phrases in this book even allow room for consideration of the religion of the day (e.g. 31-32, 62, 72, 85, 109, 148). More often than not such mentions only raise more questions.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Take Pierre Destr\xC3\xA9e who writes of the scholarly consensus that Plato does not want to confuse the divine sign \"with some traditional religious way of considering a <i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> as a personal guardian\" (62).<span style=\"\">  </span>Destr\xC3\xA9e later resists this consensus, invoking \"the popular view of the </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> as attached to each person from birth\" (72); either way he contents himself with sparse and ambiguous references where the discussion would profit from detail.<span style=\"\">  </span>Just what tradition or popular view of the </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> does he mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">For well before Christianity arrived the Greeks could think of a <i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> as a source of malevolent activity.<span style=\"\">  </span>See most generally Burkert, </span><i>Greek Religion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (Harvard University Press, 1987), 180-81.<span style=\"\">  </span>In </span><i>Odyssey</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 5.396 illness is a \"hated [</span><i>stugeros</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">] </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n,</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\" while Pindar with superstitious indirection refers to an \"other </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\" (</span><i>Pyth.</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 3.34).<span style=\"\">  </span>Indeed the \"good </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\" to whom Aristophanes' characters pour propitiatory libations (</span><i>Knights</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 85, </span><i>Wasps</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 525) may only have been called </span><i>agathos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> as a euphemism, part of the effort to placate him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Even if the evidence for malevolent <i>daimones</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> does not preponderate over references to \"personal guardians,\" the existence of that evidence opens up the question of what Socrates might have been alluding to, or how he might have been heard by his contemporaries.<span style=\"\">  </span>It should not go without saying, as it is permitted to here, that Socrates' language drew on \"traditions\" about personal helpers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">In another paper Gerd Van Riel emphasizes the privacy of the divine sign, and rightly so.<span style=\"\">  </span>The political import of Socrates' \"religiosity\" must indeed have to do with his privileged access to a moral touchstone removed from anything his fellow citizens say.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">But again there is an appeal to \"tradition\" whose vagueness allows only diffuse light to fall on Socrates.<span style=\"\">  </span>\"The link between Socrates and his <i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is absolutely exclusive, which is never the case when it comes to the intervention of traditional divinities\" (35).<span style=\"\">  </span></span><i>Never?</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"\">  </span>Van Riel cites no evidence for this assertion (though his sentence sounds as if it could have come from Robert Garland: See </span><i>Introducing New Gods</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> [Cornell University Press], 149).<span style=\"\">  </span>It would have helped to know, Private as opposed to what?<span style=\"\">  </span>This worry about an exclusive link \"to the personality of the recipient\" (35) needs to be fleshed out with the help of particular contrasts. <span style=\"\"> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">What about oracles, for instance?<span style=\"\">  </span>In Socrates' time it was increasingly individuals who solicited their judgments, Delphi's earlier prediction that Persia would triumph having damaged the oracle's credibility among governments (Burkert 116).<span style=\"\">  </span>Doesn't the divine message to a private client count as an exclusive intervention?<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Or consider this personal touch.<span style=\"\">  </span>Before Socrates the Pythagoreans spoke of <i>daimones</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> whom they -- and evidently no one else -- could see (Aristotle, frag. 193).<span style=\"\">  </span>What's the difference between that and Socrates' exclusive access to his </span><i>daimonion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> voice?<span style=\"\">  </span>Van Riel's focus on privacy surely has to be right, but his cause is not helped by generalizations about Greek practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">An article by Asli Gocer in the Smith-Woodruff anthology had already warned against categorizing Socrates' \"religiosity\" in the absence of better evidence about Athens as a whole (\"A New Assessment of Socratic Philosophy of Religion\").<span style=\"\">  </span>To call Socrates a nonconformist, says Gocer, one needs much better historical information about what he would have been conforming <i>to</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (123-125). <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Gocer could go further.<span style=\"\">  </span>Not only where Socrates stood by comparison with his fellow Athenians, but even what they understood him to be saying to them, remains indeterminate in the absence of a distinct picture of his fellow citizens' religion.<span style=\"\">  </span>When Socrates uses the adjective <i>daimonion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, he presumably wants to communicate something about the message he has been getting.<span style=\"\">  </span>So what is it?<span style=\"\">  </span>What is </span><i>daimonion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> in pre-Platonic Athens and how is it spoken of? <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The history of Greek religion will never substitute for scrutiny of every Platonic passage that mentions the divine sign.<span style=\"\">  </span>The contributors to this anthology are right to bring tough questions to bear on the passages they cite.<span style=\"\">  </span>Asking questions has not ceased to be the philosopher's job.<o:p></o:p></p>   But if the philosopher is bent on hearing an answer, the historian of philosophy is meanwhile trying to <i>over</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">hear a distant answer to a now nearly inaudible question.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is where the study of religious practice comes in.<span style=\"\">  </span>To make out what the Athenians were muttering to each other or what Plato said back to them, today's eavesdropper needs to know how the conversation had already been going before Socrates ever arrived to join it.<span style=\"\">\r\n\

having read it they will surely speak of Socrates in new ways.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is good to have such a book available.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Moreover it is good to know that such a book <i>can</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> come out today, a heartening sign of the times bespeaking welcome change in studies of ancient thought.<span style=\"\">  </span>For thirty years or more the serious assessment of Greek religion has made ancient beliefs and practices look worthier of study than they had been.<span style=\"\">  </span>The names of Walter Burkert and Jean-Pierre Vernant are only the most prominent of many in this enterprise.<span style=\"\">   </span>Still philosophers have a hard time responding to fifth- and fourth-century Athenian thought as other than the work of \"free-thinkers.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>You can blame Thucydides and his role as every modern's guide to the fifth century: Thucydides with his impatience for oracles can make Socrates' Athens seem as atheistical as a philosophy department in America today.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">But Socrates was not a man in the Athenian crowd enslaved by intellectual fashions of the day.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Platonic Socrates talked about hearing and heeding dreams (<i>Apology</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, </span><i>Crito</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, </span><i>Phaedo</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) and about obeying the Delphic oracle (</span><i>Apology, Republic</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">); he spilled wine to Zeus in the </span><i>Symposium.</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"\">  </span>In several other dialogues (</span><i>Ion, Phaedrus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) he attributed poetry to divine inspiration.<span style=\"\">  </span>The voice he heard was part of a life that included divinity, and theories about Socrates will be incomplete if they pretend otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Thus when Thomas Brickhouse and Nicholas Smith refute Gregory Vlastos's reductionist reading of the divine sign -- the voice as a rational hunch -- they are helping to bring a suppressed side of Socrates back into the picture (44-49).<span style=\"\">  </span>Socrates' experience was genuinely religious -- which as Brickhouse and Smith also point out does not make it irrational (61-62).<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Mark McPherran too has worked to expand the prevailing interpretation of Socrates' rationality.<span style=\"\">  </span>It stands to reason that he should be part of this book: He played a major role in the Smith-Woodruff volume, and his own <i>The Religion of Socrates</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1996) argued at length for the compatibility between Socrates' piety and his philosophical enterprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">McPherran is a typical contributor in some ways, for these tend to be widely recognized names in Socrates-studies, knowledgeable and clear-thinking but also imaginative scholars.<span style=\"\">  </span>He stands out in one respect that is worth drawing attention to: He keeps himself apprised of contemporary research into Athenian religion and incorporates his research into his assessment of Socrates.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Although McPherran's book contains the most numerous examples of how he uses knowledge about Greek religion, there are some here too.<span style=\"\">  </span>His article in <i>Socrates' Divine Sign</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> vivifies references to the voice by exploring it as a relationship between Socrates and Apollo (26-30).<span style=\"\">  </span>McPherran juxtaposes Socrates' trust in dreams to the skepticism Aristotle voices in </span><i>On Divination in Sleep</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 464a, to offer some cultural lens through which to see Socrates (13-14).<span style=\"\">  </span>These are hardly detailed inquiries into Greek religion, and yet they exceed what one finds in the book's other articles.<span style=\"\">  </span>Most proceed without reference to how Socrates' contemporaries practiced their religion and especially without reference to what recent research into the subject has discovered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">To put the point another way: It is true that all claims about the Socratic divine sign have to rest on fewer than a dozen passages.<span style=\"\">  </span>But reviewing these few passages can have the effect of excluding questions about the background of classical Athenian religious practice.<span style=\"\">  </span>Only a few phrases in this book even allow room for consideration of the religion of the day (e.g. 31-32, 62, 72, 85, 109, 148). More often than not such mentions only raise more questions.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Take Pierre Destr\xC3\xA9e who writes of the scholarly consensus that Plato does not want to confuse the divine sign \"with some traditional religious way of considering a <i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> as a personal guardian\" (62).<span style=\"\">  </span>Destr\xC3\xA9e later resists this consensus, invoking \"the popular view of the </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> as attached to each person from birth\" (72); either way he contents himself with sparse and ambiguous references where the discussion would profit from detail.<span style=\"\">  </span>Just what tradition or popular view of the </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> does he mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">For well before Christianity arrived the Greeks could think of a <i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> as a source of malevolent activity.<span style=\"\">  </span>See most generally Burkert, </span><i>Greek Religion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (Harvard University Press, 1987), 180-81.<span style=\"\">  </span>In </span><i>Odyssey</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 5.396 illness is a \"hated [</span><i>stugeros</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">] </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n,</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\" while Pindar with superstitious indirection refers to an \"other </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\" (</span><i>Pyth.</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 3.34).<span style=\"\">  </span>Indeed the \"good </span><i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\" to whom Aristophanes' characters pour propitiatory libations (</span><i>Knights</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 85, </span><i>Wasps</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 525) may only have been called </span><i>agathos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> as a euphemism, part of the effort to placate him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Even if the evidence for malevolent <i>daimones</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> does not preponderate over references to \"personal guardians,\" the existence of that evidence opens up the question of what Socrates might have been alluding to, or how he might have been heard by his contemporaries.<span style=\"\">  </span>It should not go without saying, as it is permitted to here, that Socrates' language drew on \"traditions\" about personal helpers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">In another paper Gerd Van Riel emphasizes the privacy of the divine sign, and rightly so.<span style=\"\">  </span>The political import of Socrates' \"religiosity\" must indeed have to do with his privileged access to a moral touchstone removed from anything his fellow citizens say.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">But again there is an appeal to \"tradition\" whose vagueness allows only diffuse light to fall on Socrates.<span style=\"\">  </span>\"The link between Socrates and his <i>daim\xC3\xB4n</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is absolutely exclusive, which is never the case when it comes to the intervention of traditional divinities\" (35).<span style=\"\">  </span></span><i>Never?</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"\">  </span>Van Riel cites no evidence for this assertion (though his sentence sounds as if it could have come from Robert Garland: See </span><i>Introducing New Gods</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> [Cornell University Press], 149).<span style=\"\">  </span>It would have helped to know, Private as opposed to what?<span style=\"\">  </span>This worry about an exclusive link \"to the personality of the recipient\" (35) needs to be fleshed out with the help of particular contrasts. <span style=\"\"> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">What about oracles, for instance?<span style=\"\">  </span>In Socrates' time it was increasingly individuals who solicited their judgments, Delphi's earlier prediction that Persia would triumph having damaged the oracle's credibility among governments (Burkert 116).<span style=\"\">  </span>Doesn't the divine message to a private client count as an exclusive intervention?<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Or consider this personal touch.<span style=\"\">  </span>Before Socrates the Pythagoreans spoke of <i>daimones</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> whom they -- and evidently no one else -- could see (Aristotle, frag. 193).<span style=\"\">  </span>What's the difference between that and Socrates' exclusive access to his </span><i>daimonion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> voice?<span style=\"\">  </span>Van Riel's focus on privacy surely has to be right, but his cause is not helped by generalizations about Greek practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">An article by Asli Gocer in the Smith-Woodruff anthology had already warned against categorizing Socrates' \"religiosity\" in the absence of better evidence about Athens as a whole (\"A New Assessment of Socratic Philosophy of Religion\").<span style=\"\">  </span>To call Socrates a nonconformist, says Gocer, one needs much better historical information about what he would have been conforming <i>to</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (123-125). <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Gocer could go further.<span style=\"\">  </span>Not only where Socrates stood by comparison with his fellow Athenians, but even what they understood him to be saying to them, remains indeterminate in the absence of a distinct picture of his fellow citizens' religion.<span style=\"\">  </span>When Socrates uses the adjective <i>daimonion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, he presumably wants to communicate something about the message he has been getting.<span style=\"\">  </span>So what is it?<span style=\"\">  </span>What is </span><i>daimonion</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> in pre-Platonic Athens and how is it spoken of? <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The history of Greek religion will never substitute for scrutiny of every Platonic passage that mentions the divine sign.<span style=\"\">  </span>The contributors to this anthology are right to bring tough questions to bear on the passages they cite.<span style=\"\">  </span>Asking questions has not ceased to be the philosopher's job.<o:p></o:p></p>   But if the philosopher is bent on hearing an answer, the historian of philosophy is meanwhile trying to <i>over</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">hear a distant answer to a now nearly inaudible question.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is where the study of religious practice comes in.<span style=\"\">  </span>To make out what the Athenians were muttering to each other or what Plato said back to them, today's eavesdropper needs to know how the conversation had already been going before Socrates ever arrived to join it.<span style=\"\">\r\n\
