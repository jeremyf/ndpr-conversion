content: "\xE2\x80\x80<o:p></o:p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">On the  basis of what principles should we determine whether the international legal order is  just and/or legitimate? This is undoubtedly a timely question, with  significant practical implications. Our answer to it determines, among other things, whether we should abide by current international law, try to reform it,  or replace it altogether. Lukas H. Meyer's collection brings together  leading scholars from different disciplines, including political philosophy,  International Relations, jurisprudence and legal theory, each addressing one or more  aspects of this important question. The essays in this collection range from  very theoretical to more applied, and can be broadly divided into three  categories:<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;\" align=\"left\">1.<span style=\"font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;\">     </span>those which  discuss the <i>legitimacy </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">of the international legal system, and of various institutions within it --  namely, Allen Buchanan's and Robert Keohane's, Samantha Besson's, Simon Caney's,  and Steven R. Ratner's;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;\" align=\"left\">2.<span style=\"font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;\">     </span>those which  address the question of international, or global, <i>distributive  justice</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> -- namely, Daniel Butt's,  Peter Koller's, and Herlinde Pauer-Studer's;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;\" align=\"left\">3.<span style=\"font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;\">     </span>those which  deal with <i>legitimate humanitarian intervention and the use of force</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> across borders -- namely, David Miller's,  Matthias Lutz-Bachmann's, and Arthur Isak Applbaum's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">Even if  the contributions are not all as well integrated as they could be -- in  particular, the first half of the book struck me as more coherent than the second --  the collection as a whole is rich and instructive. Above all, it has the  virtue of addressing the question of international justice and legitimacy from an interdisciplinary perspective, encompassing philosophy, IR, and legal  theory. Until recently, these different literatures have proceeded separately,  when there is in fact a lot that they can learn from one another. Meyer's  collection helps to show why and how.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">Since it  would be impossible for me to offer a well-developed discussion of the many  issues canvassed in each chapter, I will limit myself to commenting on two key philosophical, and inter-related, questions, which the book as a whole  tries to answer:<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;\" align=\"left\">1.<span style=\"font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;\">     </span>How should  we conceive of international (global) legitimacy?<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;\" align=\"left\">2.<span style=\"font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;\">     </span>How does  international legitimacy relate to/differ from international (global) justice?<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">In my  discussion, I will draw on insights from a number of different essays (especially from  the first half of the book), so as to give readers a sense of what this collection  has to offer, especially from a philosophical point of view, and raise a few  issues for future discussion.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><i>How  should we conceive of international (global) legitimacy?<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">This  question may be asked at both a functional and a substantive level. That is, we may want  to know what follows, normatively, from the fact that a particular  international institution is legitimate; or we may want to know what standards have to  be adopted for such an institution to be legitimate. With respect to the  first question, Daniel Butt's essay helpfully distinguishes between two senses  of legitimacy: thin and thick. In Butt's view \"a system of law possesses  thin legitimacy insofar as it is morally justifiable for institutional actors coercively to impose its requirements, and thick legitimacy insofar as  those subject to the law possess a political obligation to obey the law.\" (p. 174)<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">Different  essays within this collection work with either one or the other account of  legitimacy. For instance, Buchanan and Keohane appear to use the idea of legitimacy  in a thin sense.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup> In their view, an institution is (normatively) legitimate \"if it has the  <i>right to rule</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> -- where ruling includes promulgating rules and attempting to secure compliance with them by  attaching costs to non-compliance and/or benefits to compliance.\" (p. 29 original emphasis). This need not entail that the institution's subjects are  always obligated to obey its rules; however, it does mean that the institution deserves to be supported, and perhaps ameliorated. In particular, for  Buchanan and Keohane, \"Judging an institution to be legitimate focuses critical discourse by signalling that the appropriate objective is to reform it,  rather than to reject it outright.\" (p. 31) Besson, on the other hand, opts for  a thicker, more demanding, idea of legitimacy, according to which when an institution is legitimate its pronouncements should be seen as  authoritative. On her view, a legitimate law is one that \"bind[s] those to whom it applies.\" (p. 60)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">Despite  their adoption of slightly different <i>concepts</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">  of legitimacy, Buchanan and Keohane, Besson, and others, are in broad  agreement when it comes to the specific substantive </span><i>conceptions</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of international legitimacy they defend  (this, in turn, suggests that the distinction between thick and thin legitimacy is  mostly a matter of nuance, and perhaps not needed after all). So, when are international rules and institutions legitimate? That is, when do they  have the right to rule, and deserve support, if not strict obedience, from those  subject to them?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">Most  authors in this volume agree that actual consent on the part of states (even when these  are democratic), by itself, is insufficient to confer legitimacy on  international institutions. Instead, they opt for a two-part standard, comprising both substantive and procedural requirements. The substantive requirements  typically include respect for some minimal criteria of justice (e.g., basic human rights), while the procedural ones point in the direction of democratic accountability. Although only Besson defends a full-blown conception of pluralistic, de-territorialized, global democracy, other authors are  also keen to make room for democratic values within their frameworks. For  instance, Buchanan and Keohane emphasize how their \"complex standard\" of legitimacy accommodates democratic values, such as equal respect for  persons and deliberative decision-making even \"in the absence of global democracy\" (pp. 53-4). Similarly, Caney sees the ability to \"provide a fair political framework in which to determine which principles of  justice should be adopted [at the global level]\" as a necessary (albeit not a sufficient) condition for the legitimacy of international economic  institutions. (p. 117)<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">What to  make of this popular two-part standard of international legitimacy? I find the  general idea that legitimacy has both substantive and procedural dimensions  persuasive. However, the double nature of legitimacy standards immediately raises  the question of how substantive and procedural criteria should be balanced  against one another in establishing whether a particular institution is  legitimate. Say that an international institution respects basic human rights, but it  does very poorly in terms of accountability and transparency (which is often the  case with many international institutions today). Is such an institution  legitimate -- i.e., should we broadly support it and perhaps try to reform it -- or  should we abandon it altogether? My sense is that we should try to address  procedural failures by reforming the institution, rather than by dispensing with it altogether. If this is the case, however, it looks like the institution  is legitimate (at least on Buchanan and Keohane's account), and that  procedural criteria have less of a role to play than some of our theorists think.  More generally, assessing the relative weight of substantive and procedural  criteria for legitimacy seems to be an area of debate worthy of consideration.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><i>How  does international legitimacy relate to/differ from international (global)  justice?<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">As John  Rawls famously said, justice is \"the first virtue\" of social institutions. If we already have justice, one may ask, what do we need legitimacy for? While  some of the essays in this collection, e.g., Koller's and Pauer-Studer's,  focus exclusively on the question of international (or global) justice, others  tackle the issue of the relationship between justice and legitimacy more  directly.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">Once  again, our authors seem to be in agreement. Implicit in the works of Buchanan and  Keohane, Butt, and Caney is the idea that while a legitimate institution warrants general support but may still be improved, a just institution is somehow morally perfect. When an institution is <i>just</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> there is no more room for improvement.  Legitimacy, then, is portrayed as a \"threshold\" concept. To be legitimate, an institution \"need not be perfectly just . . . but it must meet some minimal level of justice\" (Butt, p. 175). As we have seen, this minimal justice  threshold, at the international level, is typically represented by respect for  basic human rights.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">But why  do we need a lower threshold in the first place? A key reason for this, many of the contributors to this collection seem to think, is the presence of  reasonable disagreement about what justice requires at the international level. In  Caney's words, </p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">It is hard to deny that many reasonable and reflective people disagree about  which principles of distributive justice, if any, should apply at the global  level. Given this it seems unreasonable simply to state that political  institutions should be designed to best realise the correct principles of  distributive justice. (p. 116; see also Buchanan and Keohane, p. 35, and Besson, pp.  64-5). </p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">In turn,  the presence of this reasonable disagreement justifies the inclusion of procedural,  democratic, or quasi-democratic, standards in the authors' criteria of international legitimacy. If, beyond a minimal threshold of justice, what global  justice requires is reasonably disputed, a legitimate international system must  provide fora and mechanisms for fair confrontation, deliberation and discussion  about what global justice requires.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">This  particular perspective on the relation between justice and legitimacy suggests that  while international justice is an \"ideal virtue\", international legitimacy is a \"non-ideal one\". In an ideal world, where everyone agrees about justice, we would not need to resort to criteria of legitimacy. However,  in the real world, where we deeply disagree about justice, legitimacy becomes a salient institutional virtue (see the book's introduction, pp. 22-3).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">Although  it is tempting to reach this conclusion about the relationship between justice  and legitimacy, I am not persuaded it is correct. It seems plausible to  believe that even an ideal theory of justice should not exceed the limits of the circumstances of human existence. If \"ought implies can\", a valid (ideal) theory of justice should not contain requirements that are  altogether beyond human reach. In Rawls's words, when designing an ideal theory of justice, we \"strive for the best we can attain within the scope the  world allows\".<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup>  Does a scenario in which everyone freely agrees about justice fall \"within the scope the world allows\"? I, for one, think we should be sceptical about this. The extensive and pervasive disagreements about justice we face in  the world today seem to be, at least to a large extent, a consequence of our  living under free institutions. Full agreement about morality and justice is  only possible under oppressive, totalitarian regimes.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup> If this is correct, then the only justice we can aspire to achieve is  what many authors in this volume call legitimacy. If we can regard reasonable disagreement about justice as a persistent feature of human existence  (in the same way in which moderate scarcity and limited altruism are), then we  are led to conclude that there is no justice beyond legitimacy. This, I believe,  is an interesting possibility which is also deserving of further attention.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><i>Conclusion<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">The  question of what global justice and global legitimacy require is practically salient and theoretically challenging. This collection advances our understanding of  this issue through a rich and multi-faceted set of essays. In this review, I  could only discuss one of the key theoretical themes of the book, leaving  aside some of its more applied contributions. This, however, should not be taken as  an indication that these other contributions are not worth reading.  Although, as I have indicated earlier, the book is not always optimally integrated,  each chapter competently addresses important moral issues arising in the international arena, and the book as a whole provides a valuable  contribution to existing literature, and a starting point for future  interdisciplinary research.<o:p></o:p></p>    \r\n  <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">    <div style=\"\" id=\"edn1\">  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup>  I say \"seem\" because whether the idea is used in a thick or thin sense depends on what understanding of a \"right to rule\" Buchanan and Keohane employ. If this right is understood as a Hohfeldian claim-right,  with a correlative duty to be obeyed, then their idea of legitimacy is in fact  thick. If, on the other hand, it is a Hohfeldian liberty-right (with no  correlative duty) then their proposed idea of legitimacy is thin. <o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn2\">  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup>  Although Butt also points out that perhaps more than respect for basic human  rights might be necessary. <o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn3\">  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup>  John Rawls, <i>Political Liberalism</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (New York: Columbia  University Press, 1993), p. 88.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>    <sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref4\" name=\"_edn4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup>  Rawls, <i>Political Liberalism</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.</span>"

However,  in the real world, where we deeply disagree about justice, legitimacy becomes a salient institutional virtue (see the book's introduction, pp. 22-3).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">Although  it is tempting to reach this conclusion about the relationship between justice  and legitimacy, I am not persuaded it is correct. It seems plausible to  believe that even an ideal theory of justice should not exceed the limits of the circumstances of human existence. If \"ought implies can\", a valid (ideal) theory of justice should not contain requirements that are  altogether beyond human reach. In Rawls's words, when designing an ideal theory of justice, we \"strive for the best we can attain within the scope the  world allows\".<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup>  Does a scenario in which everyone freely agrees about justice fall \"within the scope the world allows\"? I, for one, think we should be sceptical about this. The extensive and pervasive disagreements about justice we face in  the world today seem to be, at least to a large extent, a consequence of our  living under free institutions. Full agreement about morality and justice is  only possible under oppressive, totalitarian regimes.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup> If this is correct, then the only justice we can aspire to achieve is  what many authors in this volume call legitimacy. If we can regard reasonable disagreement about justice as a persistent feature of human existence  (in the same way in which moderate scarcity and limited altruism are), then we  are led to conclude that there is no justice beyond legitimacy. This, I believe,  is an interesting possibility which is also deserving of further attention.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><i>Conclusion<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"left\">The  question of what global justice and global legitimacy require is practically salient and theoretically challenging. This collection advances our understanding of  this issue through a rich and multi-faceted set of essays. In this review, I  could only discuss one of the key theoretical themes of the book, leaving  aside some of its more applied contributions. This, however, should not be taken as  an indication that these other contributions are not worth reading.  Although, as I have indicated earlier, the book is not always optimally integrated,  each chapter competently addresses important moral issues arising in the international arena, and the book as a whole provides a valuable  contribution to existing literature, and a starting point for future  interdisciplinary research.<o:p></o:p></p>    \r\n  <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">    <div style=\"\" id=\"edn1\">  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup>  I say \"seem\" because whether the idea is used in a thick or thin sense depends on what understanding of a \"right to rule\" Buchanan and Keohane employ. If this right is understood as a Hohfeldian claim-right,  with a correlative duty to be obeyed, then their idea of legitimacy is in fact  thick. If, on the other hand, it is a Hohfeldian liberty-right (with no  correlative duty) then their proposed idea of legitimacy is thin. <o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn2\">  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup>  Although Butt also points out that perhaps more than respect for basic human  rights might be necessary. <o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn3\">  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup>  John Rawls, <i>Political Liberalism</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (New York: Columbia  University Press, 1993), p. 88.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>    <sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref4\" name=\"_edn4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup>  Rawls, <i>Political Liberalism</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.</span>"
