Throughout the papers are scattered the cast of characters that attempted to struggle not only with Galileo's ideas, but with his commitment to a new way to do what was to become physics. We find that while there were disciples of Galileo, they were few and did not so much defend the master's ideas, as work to make them viable in an atmosphere of evolving and competing conceptions and tools.<span style=\"\">  </span>Likewise, we find that it wasn't so much that there was no Galilean science, but that it was absorbed into something bigger and more comprehensive than merely the science of motion.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">We start with Alan Gabbey setting the context -- rejecting anachronistic terms like \"mechanical philosophy\" and \"mathematical mechanics\" for a more nuanced and contextualized look at the state of natural philosophy and mechanics in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.<span style=\"\">   </span>What Gabbey argues for is a sense of the times as producing a new way of thinking about the world that emerged in the work of Galileo, Descartes, Newton and others, which phenomenon was messy and slow to congeal.<span style=\"\">  </span>Essentially Gabbey is arguing that the emergence of terminology to capture this or that movement is a complicated process that requires something going on, but what that something is takes time to clarify.<span style=\"\">  </span>Thus Gabbey sorts through various meanings of the term \"mechanics\", distinguishing Galileo's technical sense from Descartes' developing idea of \"mechanical\" that makes a mathematical science of motion possible.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Sophie Roux continues the focus on the role of Descartes and his developing conception of \"mechanical.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>She looks at what she calls the two worlds of mechanics Descartes inhabited, one concerned with the general idea of mechanics in which there is a programmatic identity of physics and mechanics, and the other which is close to the old practice of statics. It is through the correspondents that Descartes interacted with that we see the development of his thought as Roux explores the problem of heaviness.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">William Shea, the current dean of Galileo scholars, takes on the complicated project of determining if Descartes in fact developed his own version of the law of free fall prior to Galileo, showing definitively that he did not.<span style=\"\">  </span>What Shea makes clear are some of the problems created by working out of one framework while striving to develop another.

Floris Cohen continues the theme of a clash of conceptions of science, accepting the unsettled intellectual atmosphere of the times. Cohen's main objective is to present an analytical framework for doing the kind of history he proposes to do, i.e., one which reveals the complex and confusing nature of the times.<span style=\"\">  </span>He begins by focusing on schools of thought originating in Athens and Alexandria, showing how they develop in relative isolation from one another and how difficult it was for fusions of the two modes of thought to occur.<span style=\"\">  </span>He credits Galileo with that achievement by recognizing the difference between nature seen mathematically and the nature of everyday reality. </p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">In their contribution, Jochen B\xC3\xBCttner, Peter Damerow, and J\xC3\xBCrgen Renn argue for a system of shared knowledge amongst the participants in the discussions over motion in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, one created by correspondence and the free exchange of ideas more than through publication. <span style=\"\">  </span>Their point is to lay the foundation for an exploration of the resistance to Galileo's ideas by showing that many of the objections raised against Galileo were explored by Galileo himself in some of these unpublished but often shared texts.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is also a theme pursued by Enrico Giusti with respect to Galileo's interactions with Torricelli, Sarpi, and Cavalieri.<span style=\"\">  </span>He shows that in these exchanges, as opposed to full treatises, there is a working out of ideas that only eventually find their way into the <i>Discorsi. </i></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">One of the major defenders of Galileo outside of Italy was Gassendi.<span style=\"\">  </span>Carla Rita Palmerino<span style=\"\">  </span>gives an in-depth analysis of his two letters, first laying out Gassendi's<span style=\"\">  </span>proof that a ball dropped from the top of a mast of a ship in motion falls directly down at the bottom of the mast and then his discussion of the implications of these results.
