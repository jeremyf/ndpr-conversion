  <p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is a welcome book.<span style="">  </span>Nancey Murphy defends a version of physicalism for Christians.<span style="">   </span>She characterizes the physicalism that she endorses as the thesis that "we are our bodies -- there is no additional metaphysical element such as a mind or soul or spirit."<span style="">   </span>Nevertheless, biology does not tell the whole story:<span style="">  </span>We are "complex physical organisms, imbued with the legacy of thousands of years of culture, and, most importantly, blown by the Breath of God's Spirit; we are Spirited bodies." (ix)<span style="">  </span>Murphy takes her main opponent to be a soul- or mind-body dualist.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The book appears in Current Issues in Theology, a series of short and focused theological studies, aimed at students, Christian teachers and church professionals.<span style="">  </span>As her title suggests, Murphy's book is on the nature of human persons. With no pretense to being scholarly with respect to early church history or biblical studies, the book presents brief and accessible summaries of views on the soul, on resurrection, and on the impact of science on Christian conceptions of human persons.<span style="">  </span>Murphy is careful to point out that oversimplifications are inevitable in a brief and accessible book.<span style="">  </span>Although a serious student of theology will want to dig deeper, this book is a good place to start. </p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">There are four chapters.<span style="">  </span>Chapter One explores Biblical and theological perspectives on human nature.<span style="">  </span>Chapter Two discusses what physics, evolutionary biology and neuroscience say about human nature.<span style="">  </span>Chapter Three argues against reductionism, and defends free will and morality.<span style="">  </span>Chapter Four takes up human distinctiveness, divine action and personal identity as challenges to physicalism.<span style="">  </span>Although I found many of the arguments difficult to follow in detail, I shall try to summarize the main points.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In Chapter One, Murphy convincingly shows that there is no such thing as "the" anthropology of the Bible or of the Christian tradition.<span style="">  </span>Murphy argues that the fact that the Bible seems to teach dualism is largely a result of poor translations.<span style="">  </span>Once the translations are repaired, "it is hard to find any clear <i>teaching</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> on the metaphysical make-up of the person" in the Bible at all. (p. 37)<span style="">  </span>The Biblical authors were "interested in the various dimensions of human life, in relationships, not in the philosophical question of how many parts are essential components of a human being."<span style="">  </span>(p. 39)<span style="">  </span>Thus, the door is open to physicalism.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">What difference can or should physicalism make to theology?<span style="">  </span>Murphy makes some brief suggestions about theological issues like the doctrine of God, Christology and Trinity, Salvation and History, and about the unfortunate effects of dualism.<span style="">  </span>The adoption of physicalism may lend Christian spirituality renewed emphases on the significance of the body, and on the reign of God, in which followers of Jesus participate by active love of neighbor and in struggle for justice and peace.<span style="">  </span>These are interesting ideas, worth pursuing at greater depth than is possible in a book of this compass. </p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Chapter Two hammers more nails into the coffin of dualism.<span style="">  </span>Murphy sees three periods of re-appraisal of human nature prompted by science:<span style="">  </span>the replacement of Aristotelian physics by modern atomistic physics, the Darwinian revolution, and recent developments in the neurosciences.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Murphy begins with a brief discussion of how the atomist revolution undercut the medieval Christian world-view by calling into question the Aristotelian and Thomistic idea of the soul as the form of the body.<span style="">  </span>There seemed two options:<span style="">  </span>Hobbes' physicalism, and Descartes' "return to a radical dualism of mind (or soul) and body." (p. 45)<span style="">   </span>In the face of modern physics, mind-body dualism has seemed implausible:<span style="">  </span>How could an immaterial mind cause a body to move?</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The Darwinian revolution highlighted the continuity between human beings and other higher animals.<span style="">  </span>The transitions between species were too gradual to suppose that humans have souls but other animals do not.<span style="">  </span>Murphy points to the theological roots of social Darwinism.<span style="">  </span>Paley set the stage by arguing that whatever the character of the natural order, it was designed by God.<span style="">  </span>Then, Malthus (an Anglican clergyman) explained that the character of the natural order was "competition and starvation" -- which then can be seen as providential. (p. 53)</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The cognitive neurosciences give reason to think that all the human capacities attributed to the soul can be understood as "processes involving the brain, the rest of the nervous system and other bodily systems, all interacting with the socio-cultural world."<span style="">  </span>(p. 56)<span style="">  </span>Interestingly, a number of views of Thomas Aquinas (e.g., his recognition of <i>vis aestimativa</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, or an estimative power) find echoes in neuroscience (e.g.,<span style="">  </span>the discovery of the role of the amygdala in responding to intentions of others).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Chapter Three is a defense of nonreductive physicalism.<span style="">  </span>In particular, Murphy aims to show how nonreductive physicalism allows us to have free will and moral responsibility.<span style="">  </span>Her strategy has two prongs.<span style="">  </span>First, she argues against reductionism and for downward causation.<span style="">  </span>Second, she argues that human beings are "highly self-directed organisms whose behavior exerts downward causal control over their neural systems," and that they can come to "govern their own behavior on the basis of <i>moral</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> reasons." (p. 73)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Murphy construes reductionism as the two-fold thesis that all entities are (nothing but) arrangements of atoms and that the behavior of an entity is determined by the behavior of its parts.<span style="">  </span>She takes reductionism to imply that all causation is micro-causation.<span style="">  </span>This allows her to argue against reductionism by examples of "holistic" properties (like shape) that are causally efficacious.<span style="">   </span>I do not believe that reductionists would be convinced.<span style="">  </span>They agree that shape is causally efficacious and is a property of a whole entity, but they also believe that the shape of the whole entity is determined by the shapes and arrangement of the parts.<span style="">  </span>(See, e.g., Jaegwon Kim.)</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Murphy defends downward causation.<span style="">  </span>She does not set out her defense straightforwardly as an argument; so what follows is my best reconstruction. (pp. 78-84)<span style="">   </span>First, Murphy distinguishes laws from initial or boundary conditions; then she argues that boundary conditions are themselves determined top-down.<span style="">  </span>Often, the boundary conditions (structural and environmental) exert downward causal efficacy by means of "selection of lower-level entities or causal processes according to the way they fit into higher-level causal patterns." (p. 90)<span style="">  </span>The laws of a system of higher-level organization, where natural selection operates, are not reducible to laws of physics.<span style="">  </span>"The patterns of boundary conditions picked out by the special sciences have downward causal efficacy in that they can affect which causal powers of their constituents are activated or likely to be activated."<span style="">  </span>(p. 83)<span style="">   </span>So, she concludes, higher-level processes can influence lower-level processes, including brain processes. (p. 97)</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The self-directedness needed for moral responsibility begins to emerge when an organism can use information from its environment to redirect its activity. (p. 86)<span style="">  </span>Finally, more complex creatures are capable of "self-transcendence" -- the "ability to represent to oneself aspects of one's own cognitive processes in order to be able to evaluate them." (p.89)<span style="">  </span>Self-transcendence, along with language, provides the means of escaping biological determinism. (p. 91)</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Murphy then turns to free will and moral responsibility (the reason that we care about free will).<span style="">   </span>She sets aside challenges to moral responsibility from God's foreknowledge, predestination, and social determinism on the grounds that "the issue at stake for the physicalist is neurobiological determinism." (p. 103)<span style="">  </span>Her aim is to show that moral responsibility is compatible with what we know about neuroscience and cognition.<span style="">   </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">One of the capacities needed for moral responsibility is the ability to evaluate one's desires.<span style="">  </span>Murphy comments that "cognitive processes need to be understood in terms of hierarchical levels of processing such that higher cognitive levels influence lower levels, for example, by means of attention, expectancy, intention -- and thus lower-level brain processes<i>."</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (p. 97)<span style="">   </span>She says that if she has made the case for downward causation via selection, "it makes no difference whether the laws of the bottom level are deterministic or not; higher-level selective processes can operate equally well on a range of possibilities that have been produced (at the lower-level) by either random or </span><i>deterministic</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> processes." (pp. 106-7, her emphasis)<span style="">  </span>This claim seems to miss the point.<span style="">  </span>Higher-level selective causal processes may themselves be deterministic; indeed, there is no reason to think that selective processes are not deterministic.<span style="">   </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In fact, Murphy may well agree.<span style="">  </span>Her characterization of free will is a compatibilist one:<span style="">  </span>"[W]hen a person acts on the basis of considered goals and principles, without undue biological or social interference, she has become the author of her own acts and ought to be described as acting freely." (p. 108)<span style="">  </span>She explicitly argues against the idea of free will as "total autonomy". <span style=""> </span>This makes me wonder why she thinks that neurobiological determinism is a threat to moral responsibility at all.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Chapter Four takes up four issues:<span style="">  </span>(i) What reason is there to think that physicalism is true?<span style="">  </span>(ii) If human beings are just organisms (without souls), then in what way are human beings distinctive?<span style="">  </span>(iii) How does God act in the physical world?<span style="">  </span>(iv) In what does personal identity consist?</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Murphy's response to (i) is that there is scientific support for physicalism, but not for dualism.<span style="">  </span>Re (ii) Murphy argues that human beings are distinctive in being able to carry out moral duties, and to do so because they are moral duties.<span style="">  </span>Also, we (sans souls) have the ability to have a relationship with God.<span style="">  </span>As to (iii), Murphy suggests that God acts in the world at the quantum level, where there is no conflict with natural causation.<span style="">  </span>Indeed, Murphy says, "It is possible from a theistic perspective to interpret current physics as saying that the natural world is intrinsically incomplete and open to divine action at its most basic level." (p.131)<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Regarding (iv), Murphy's account of personal identity is that it "is not the body qua material object that constitutes our identities, but rather the higher capacities that it enables:<span style="">  </span>consciousness and memory, moral character, interpersonal relations, and, especially, relationship with God." (p. 132)<span style="">  </span>Taking consciousness to be an "integration of various aspects of memory and awareness," Murphy proposes a combined "body-memory-consciousness criterion" of personal identity. (p. 136-7)<span style="">  </span>Then she adds what might be called 'moral character' to the criterion.<span style="">  </span>Finally, she drops any requirement of spatio-temporal continuity for the persistence of a body.<span style="">  </span>This allows that there can be a temporal interval between "decay of the earthly body and what is then essentially the recreation of a new body out of different 'stuff'." (p. 142)</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Thus, in a very short span, Murphy uncovers many deep and important issues that face Christians today.<span style="">  </span>Now I'd like to raise two questions about Murphy's project<span style="">.
   </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(1) To what extent are we purely biological beings?<span style="">  </span>Murphy's emphasis on neurobiology suggests that we are purely biological beings; but her view that we are "complex physical organisms, imbued with the legacy of thousands of years of culture, and . . . blown by the Breath of God's Spirit" (ix) suggests that biology deals with only part of what we are.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">There is a related logical question about the place of the body in Murphy's view.<span style="">  </span>Murphy has a complex criterion of personal identity:<span style="">  </span>a "combined body-memory-consciousness" plus moral character. (pp. 137-8)<span style="">   </span>However, she also takes the body to be "<i>the substrate</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> for all of the personal attributes", and she says that "there is no reason in principle why a body that is </span><i>numerically distinct</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> but similar in all relevant respects could not support the same personal characteristics." (p. 141, my emphases)<span style="">  </span>She goes on to allow for "essentially the recreation of a new body out of different 'stuff'." (p. 142)<span style="">  </span>Is having </span><i>this very body</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a necessary condition for being me or not?<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">On the one hand, if body is part of the criterion of personal identity, then having this very body is a necessary condition for being me.<span style="">  </span>On the other hand, if I could have a body that is numerically distinct from this body, then having this very body is not a necessary condition for being me.<span style="">  </span>So, Murphy cannot have it both ways.<span style="">  </span>(Murphy's appeal to Wiggins does not mitigate this dilemma.<span style="">  </span>In the first place, Murphy does not distinguish the sortal dependency of individuation, which Wiggins endorses, from the relativity of identity, which he adamantly opposes. (see p. 133)<span style="">  </span>In the second place, the dilemma pops up no matter how 'same body' is construed.)<span style="">     </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(2)<span style="">  </span>Exactly what philosophical role does Murphy see for neurobiology?<span style="">  </span>She suggests, for example, that "one ask whether the theories of, say, Plato or Aristotle are better supported than contemporary neuroscientific theories about the sources of our capacities for cognition, emotion, and all of the other faculties that earlier theorists had attributed to the soul or mind." (p. 115)<span style="">   </span>Surely Plato and Aristotle were not trying to do what neuroscience does better.<span style="">   </span>Neuroscience looks for mechanisms that subserve the phenomena (like evaluating one's reasons) that Murphy discusses.<span style="">  </span>But we should not conflate the mechanisms with the phenomena that they subserve.<span style="">  </span>Plato and Aristotle were concerned with the philosophically interesting phenomena, not the mechanisms that subserve them.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Murphy says:<span style="">  </span>"Neuroscience now contributes to our understanding of both morality and religious experience." (p. 66)<span style="">  </span>She cites the famous case of Phineas Gage, the 19<sup>th</sup> century workman whose brain was run through by a metal rod.<span style="">  </span>Although it is interesting that brain damage to specific areas of the brain results in certain moral deficits, I do not see how this information helps us to understand <i>morality</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> any better than we already did.<span style="">  </span>Similarly, I do not see how the fact that specific parts of the brain are activated during meditation and prayer helps us understand religious experience. (pp. 67-8)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">On a number of points, I think that Murphy is exactly right:<span style="">  </span>(1) there is no single teaching about the metaphysics of human beings in the Bible or in Christian tradition, (2) some nonreductive version of physicalistic anthropology is compatible with Christianity, (3) the grounds for believing in souls have been undercut by the sciences, (4) we are still morally responsible, (5) libertarian free will is incoherent;<span style="">  </span>(6) the free will problem has been badly framed; (7) brain imaging will <i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> "provide evidence for or against the existence and action of God" (p. 69), (8) higher-level entities exist in their own right.<span style="">  </span>But defending this package of theses requires more careful attention than was always apparent in the book.<span style="">   </span>For example, on p. 74, Murphy says flatly that "the laws of nature are deterministic." Then, with no qualification of that statement, she says on p. 131 that the laws of quantum mechanics are only statistical.<span style="">  </span>No doubt, she was referring to different (irreducible) levels, but she should have made this explicit.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It is perhaps inevitable that a book of this sort will skim across the surface of many deep issues.<span style="">  </span>Still, <i>Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is written in a comfortable conversational style and introduces many of the controversies that confront Christians<span style="">  </span>today.<span style="">  </span>It will be successful if, as I expect, it whets readers' appetites for more.</span></p>

   </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(1) To what extent are we purely biological beings?<span style="">  </span>Murphy's emphasis on neurobiology suggests that we are purely biological beings; but her view that we are "complex physical organisms, imbued with the legacy of thousands of years of culture, and . . . blown by the Breath of God's Spirit" (ix) suggests that biology deals with only part of what we are.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">There is a related logical question about the place of the body in Murphy's view.<span style="">  </span>Murphy has a complex criterion of personal identity:<span style="">  </span>a "combined body-memory-consciousness" plus moral character. (pp. 137-8)<span style="">   </span>However, she also takes the body to be "<i>the substrate</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> for all of the personal attributes", and she says that "there is no reason in principle why a body that is </span><i>numerically distinct</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> but similar in all relevant respects could not support the same personal characteristics." (p. 141, my emphases)<span style="">  </span>She goes on to allow for "essentially the recreation of a new body out of different 'stuff'." (p. 142)<span style="">  </span>Is having </span><i>this very body</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a necessary condition for being me or not?<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">On the one hand, if body is part of the criterion of personal identity, then having this very body is a necessary condition for being me.<span style="">  </span>On the other hand, if I could have a body that is numerically distinct from this body, then having this very body is not a necessary condition for being me.<span style="">  </span>So, Murphy cannot have it both ways.<span style="">  </span>(Murphy's appeal to Wiggins does not mitigate this dilemma.<span style="">  </span>In the first place, Murphy does not distinguish the sortal dependency of individuation, which Wiggins endorses, from the relativity of identity, which he adamantly opposes. (see p. 133)<span style="">  </span>In the second place, the dilemma pops up no matter how 'same body' is construed.)<span style="">     </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">(2)<span style="">  </span>Exactly what philosophical role does Murphy see for neurobiology?<span style="">  </span>She suggests, for example, that "one ask whether the theories of, say, Plato or Aristotle are better supported than contemporary neuroscientific theories about the sources of our capacities for cognition, emotion, and all of the other faculties that earlier theorists had attributed to the soul or mind." (p. 115)<span style="">   </span>Surely Plato and Aristotle were not trying to do what neuroscience does better.<span style="">   </span>Neuroscience looks for mechanisms that subserve the phenomena (like evaluating one's reasons) that Murphy discusses.<span style="">  </span>But we should not conflate the mechanisms with the phenomena that they subserve.<span style="">  </span>Plato and Aristotle were concerned with the philosophically interesting phenomena, not the mechanisms that subserve them.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Murphy says:<span style="">  </span>"Neuroscience now contributes to our understanding of both morality and religious experience." (p. 66)<span style="">  </span>She cites the famous case of Phineas Gage, the 19<sup>th</sup> century workman whose brain was run through by a metal rod.<span style="">  </span>Although it is interesting that brain damage to specific areas of the brain results in certain moral deficits, I do not see how this information helps us to understand <i>morality</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> any better than we already did.<span style="">  </span>Similarly, I do not see how the fact that specific parts of the brain are activated during meditation and prayer helps us understand religious experience. (pp. 67-8)</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">On a number of points, I think that Murphy is exactly right:<span style="">  </span>(1) there is no single teaching about the metaphysics of human beings in the Bible or in Christian tradition, (2) some nonreductive version of physicalistic anthropology is compatible with Christianity, (3) the grounds for believing in souls have been undercut by the sciences, (4) we are still morally responsible, (5) libertarian free will is incoherent;<span style="">  </span>(6) the free will problem has been badly framed; (7) brain imaging will <i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> "provide evidence for or against the existence and action of God" (p. 69), (8) higher-level entities exist in their own right.<span style="">  </span>But defending this package of theses requires more careful attention than was always apparent in the book.<span style="">   </span>For example, on p. 74, Murphy says flatly that "the laws of nature are deterministic." Then, with no qualification of that statement, she says on p. 131 that the laws of quantum mechanics are only statistical.<span style="">  </span>No doubt, she was referring to different (irreducible) levels, but she should have made this explicit.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It is perhaps inevitable that a book of this sort will skim across the surface of many deep issues.<span style="">  </span>Still, <i>Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is written in a comfortable conversational style and introduces many of the controversies that confront Christians<span style="">  </span>today.<span style="">  </span>It will be successful if, as I expect, it whets readers' appetites for more.</span></p>
