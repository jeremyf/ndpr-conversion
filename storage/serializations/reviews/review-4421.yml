and, </span><i>change-theoretic</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, which focuses on understanding population processes that operate on ancestral populations of interbreeding organisms to produce altered heritable characteristics in descendant populations (pp. 196-7).<span style=\"\">  </span>Predominant representations of evolutionary theory in terms of population and quantitative genetics are change-theoretic; Evo-devo approaches are form-theoretic.<span style=\"\">  </span>With the emergence of heredity as concerned only with the transmission of 'genetic' material (instrumentally characterized) and not its expression during ontogeny (if this surprises you, read ch. 7), development was no longer causally relevant to the evolutionary process between generations.<span style=\"\">  </span>'Evolution' (for functionalists) only involves adaptation through the differential transmission of 'genes' contributing to phenotypic variation that affect fitness differences in populations.<span style=\"\">  </span>Amundson rightly stresses the existence of explanatory pluralism between functionalist and structuralist research programmes (he refers to it as 'explanatory relativity').<span style=\"\">  </span>The overly narrow commitment of adaptationist thinkers to population processes anchored in transmission genetics as the only evolutionary causes (to the exclusion of developmental processes) makes the presumptive mistake of assuming that a particular explanatory task in evolutionary biology (the </span><i>change</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">-theoretic problem) is the </span><i>only</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> explanatory task in evolutionary research. <span style=\"color: red;\"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Although I am enthusiastic in recommending this book to philosophers of biology, and philosophers of science more generally, there are several aspects that I find problematic.<span style=\"\">  </span>The first is a qualm about historical method.<span style=\"\">  </span>Amundson sometimes (though not always) utilizes secondary rather than primary sources in articulating his historical picture.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is somewhat troubling when attempting a 'revisionist' history, as the label suggests that revisiting these <i>primary</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> sources is necessary because of contemporary misreading.<span style=\"\">  </span>I do not think Amundson's case will disintegrate when others turn to these primary sources relevant to different threads of his argument.<span style=\"\">  </span>In fact, this misgiving can be seen as a virtue because Amundson's attempt at a revisionist history of evolution and embryos may spur professional historians of biology to explore relevant source materials.<span style=\"\">  </span>Amundson readily admits that he was unable to find discussions pertaining to the historical questions he was asking (p. 13).</span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">My other misgivings pertain to the philosophical analysis in Amundson's project.<span style=\"\">  </span>Although the 'form versus function' distinction is a welcome principle for contemporary philosophy of biology, replacing the dichotomies of 'typology/essentialism vs. population thinking' or 'proximate versus ultimate causation', this dichotomy yields its own problematic results.<span style=\"\">  </span>In the final chapter, Amundson sets adaptationism (function) against structuralism (form) in several distilled oppositions.<span style=\"\">  </span>For example,</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Adaptationist: Individuals don't evolve. Populations do.<span style=\"\">  </span>Species are effects of the evolution of populations.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Structuralist: Individuals don't evolve. Ontogenies do.<span style=\"\">  </span>Characters are effects of the evolution of ontogenies.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Although these characterize fundamental differences in the ontology of adaptationist and structuralist outlooks, they rely on a link between functions and the operation of natural selection in their evolutionary origin (an etiological concept of function).<span style=\"\">  </span>Another relevant concept of function, causal-role function, does not invoke adaptation.<span style=\"\">  </span>Ironically, Amundson is one of the philosophers who has highlighted the use of causal-role functions in morphological research.<sup>7</sup><span style=\"\">  </span>Thus the dichotomies adumbrated between adaptationism and structuralism do not map directly onto the distinction between function and form.<span style=\"\">  </span>And therefore Amundson's analysis misses key conceptual aspects of Evo-devo's theoretical landscape, such as the difference between research on the origin of form (novelty) and the origin of function (innovation), the latter being a question not concerned with the operation of natural selection.<sup>8</sup><span style=\"\">  </span>Recognizing this is crucial more generally because many philosophers operate with an etiological view of function and even reject alternatives from structural biology.<sup>9</sup><span style=\"\">  </span>The same issue of a problematic dichotomy appears in the form-theoretic versus change-theoretic distinction.<span style=\"\">  </span>While accurately capturing contrasts between morphology and the themes of Darwin in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, it does not pick out the <i>change</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">-theoretic aspects of form explanations in contemporary Evo-devo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Another difficulty with the philosophical content of Amundson's argument, especially as it plays out in the final chapter, is the lack of interaction with philosophy-of-science literature germane to his discussion. <span style=\"\"> </span>(Here we see the pitfall of developing one's philosophical tools primarily in the crucible of the domain under scrutiny.)<span style=\"\">  </span>He rightly identifies the differences between adaptationism and structuralism as bordering on the acceptance of distinct scientific paradigms (evident in radically different ontological priorities), but this insight is not explored further.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is especially unfortunate, as some of the 'incommensurabilities' Amundson isolates do not concern different <i>meanings</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> for the same theoretical terms used by competing research traditions.<span style=\"\">  </span>Rather they pertain to the lack of a common measure between problems, data, or criteria of explanatory adequacy,</span><sup>10, 11</sup> which have been mostly neglected because of the close connection between discussions of incommensurability and causal theories of reference for natural-kind terms.<sup>12</sup></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">In spite of these reservations, there should be no hesitation to invest time and money in digesting Amundson's argument.<span style=\"\">  </span>It exhibits the philosophical virtue of raising new questions out of material not thought to be in question while simultaneously drawing the philosophical reader into new biological terrain in a succinct fashion.<span style=\"\">  </span>I also have given only the barest outline of its historical content, which is quite significant in its own right, including the discussion of the relationship between morphology and natural theology in the 19<sup>th</sup> century (ch. 3).<span style=\"\">  </span>Many of his distillations of the crux of controversy between functionalists and structuralists should stimulate further analysis (e.g. 'Mendelian blind spots'; pp. 180ff).<span style=\"\">  </span>This book is an exemplar of how the dialectical engagement of history and philosophy is critical for a penetrating analysis of current conceptual issues in science.<span style=\"\">  </span>Evo-devo as a contemporary research program has been 'developing' for more than two decades.<span style=\"\">  </span>We now have historical perspective on some of its major evolutionary trajectories, from which emerge a multitude of epistemological problems, which should keep philosophers of biology busy for quite some time.*</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">* I am grateful to Ric Otte and Jason Robert for comments on an earlier version of this review.</p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 200%;\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">References<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">1.<span style=\"\">            </span>Raff, R.

Evo-devo approaches are form-theoretic.<span style=\"\">  </span>With the emergence of heredity as concerned only with the transmission of 'genetic' material (instrumentally characterized) and not its expression during ontogeny (if this surprises you, read ch. 7), development was no longer causally relevant to the evolutionary process between generations.<span style=\"\">  </span>'Evolution' (for functionalists) only involves adaptation through the differential transmission of 'genes' contributing to phenotypic variation that affect fitness differences in populations.<span style=\"\">  </span>Amundson rightly stresses the existence of explanatory pluralism between functionalist and structuralist research programmes (he refers to it as 'explanatory relativity').<span style=\"\">  </span>The overly narrow commitment of adaptationist thinkers to population processes anchored in transmission genetics as the only evolutionary causes (to the exclusion of developmental processes) makes the presumptive mistake of assuming that a particular explanatory task in evolutionary biology (the </span><i>change</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">-theoretic problem) is the </span><i>only</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> explanatory task in evolutionary research. <span style=\"color: red;\"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Although I am enthusiastic in recommending this book to philosophers of biology, and philosophers of science more generally, there are several aspects that I find problematic.<span style=\"\">  </span>The first is a qualm about historical method.<span style=\"\">  </span>Amundson sometimes (though not always) utilizes secondary rather than primary sources in articulating his historical picture.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is somewhat troubling when attempting a 'revisionist' history, as the label suggests that revisiting these <i>primary</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> sources is necessary because of contemporary misreading.<span style=\"\">  </span>I do not think Amundson's case will disintegrate when others turn to these primary sources relevant to different threads of his argument.<span style=\"\">  </span>In fact, this misgiving can be seen as a virtue because Amundson's attempt at a revisionist history of evolution and embryos may spur professional historians of biology to explore relevant source materials.<span style=\"\">  </span>Amundson readily admits that he was unable to find discussions pertaining to the historical questions he was asking (p. 13).</span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">My other misgivings pertain to the philosophical analysis in Amundson's project.<span style=\"\">  </span>Although the 'form versus function' distinction is a welcome principle for contemporary philosophy of biology, replacing the dichotomies of 'typology/essentialism vs. population thinking' or 'proximate versus ultimate causation', this dichotomy yields its own problematic results.<span style=\"\">  </span>In the final chapter, Amundson sets adaptationism (function) against structuralism (form) in several distilled oppositions.<span style=\"\">  </span>For example,</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Adaptationist: Individuals don't evolve. Populations do.<span style=\"\">  </span>Species are effects of the evolution of populations.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Structuralist: Individuals don't evolve. Ontogenies do.<span style=\"\">  </span>Characters are effects of the evolution of ontogenies.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Although these characterize fundamental differences in the ontology of adaptationist and structuralist outlooks, they rely on a link between functions and the operation of natural selection in their evolutionary origin (an etiological concept of function).<span style=\"\">  </span>Another relevant concept of function, causal-role function, does not invoke adaptation.<span style=\"\">  </span>Ironically, Amundson is one of the philosophers who has highlighted the use of causal-role functions in morphological research.<sup>7</sup><span style=\"\">  </span>Thus the dichotomies adumbrated between adaptationism and structuralism do not map directly onto the distinction between function and form.<span style=\"\">  </span>And therefore Amundson's analysis misses key conceptual aspects of Evo-devo's theoretical landscape, such as the difference between research on the origin of form (novelty) and the origin of function (innovation), the latter being a question not concerned with the operation of natural selection.<sup>8</sup><span style=\"\">  </span>Recognizing this is crucial more generally because many philosophers operate with an etiological view of function and even reject alternatives from structural biology.<sup>9</sup><span style=\"\">  </span>The same issue of a problematic dichotomy appears in the form-theoretic versus change-theoretic distinction.<span style=\"\">  </span>While accurately capturing contrasts between morphology and the themes of Darwin in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, it does not pick out the <i>change</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">-theoretic aspects of form explanations in contemporary Evo-devo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Another difficulty with the philosophical content of Amundson's argument, especially as it plays out in the final chapter, is the lack of interaction with philosophy-of-science literature germane to his discussion. <span style=\"\"> </span>(Here we see the pitfall of developing one's philosophical tools primarily in the crucible of the domain under scrutiny.)<span style=\"\">  </span>He rightly identifies the differences between adaptationism and structuralism as bordering on the acceptance of distinct scientific paradigms (evident in radically different ontological priorities), but this insight is not explored further.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is especially unfortunate, as some of the 'incommensurabilities' Amundson isolates do not concern different <i>meanings</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> for the same theoretical terms used by competing research traditions.<span style=\"\">  </span>Rather they pertain to the lack of a common measure between problems, data, or criteria of explanatory adequacy,</span><sup>10, 11</sup> which have been mostly neglected because of the close connection between discussions of incommensurability and causal theories of reference for natural-kind terms.<sup>12</sup></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">In spite of these reservations, there should be no hesitation to invest time and money in digesting Amundson's argument.<span style=\"\">  </span>It exhibits the philosophical virtue of raising new questions out of material not thought to be in question while simultaneously drawing the philosophical reader into new biological terrain in a succinct fashion.<span style=\"\">  </span>I also have given only the barest outline of its historical content, which is quite significant in its own right, including the discussion of the relationship between morphology and natural theology in the 19<sup>th</sup> century (ch. 3).<span style=\"\">  </span>Many of his distillations of the crux of controversy between functionalists and structuralists should stimulate further analysis (e.g. 'Mendelian blind spots'; pp. 180ff).<span style=\"\">  </span>This book is an exemplar of how the dialectical engagement of history and philosophy is critical for a penetrating analysis of current conceptual issues in science.<span style=\"\">  </span>Evo-devo as a contemporary research program has been 'developing' for more than two decades.<span style=\"\">  </span>We now have historical perspective on some of its major evolutionary trajectories, from which emerge a multitude of epistemological problems, which should keep philosophers of biology busy for quite some time.*</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">* I am grateful to Ric Otte and Jason Robert for comments on an earlier version of this review.</p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 200%;\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">References<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">1.<span style=\"\">            </span>Raff, R.
