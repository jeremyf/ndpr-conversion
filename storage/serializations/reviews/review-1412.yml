  <p>The editor of this splendid volume, Robin Wang, has hit upon the great idea of inviting American philosophers to respond to their Chinese colleagues\xE2\x80\x99 work. Six influential papers and book chapters published in Chinese in the 1980s and 90s are expertly translated into English; they then are commented on by six American philosophers. The book covers a broad range of topics and is divided into two parts. The first consists of three leading Chinese scholars\xE2\x80\x99 pieces on issues in the history of Chinese philosophy and religion: the theory of value in pre-modern China, the concepts of mind and nature in Zhu Xi (one of the most important Confucian philosophers), and polytheism in early China. They are commented on by two leading American scholars in Chinese philosophy, Kwong-loi Shun and Bryan W. Van Norden, and a philosopher of religion, Stephen Davis. The second part consists of three comparative studies: Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s and Lao-Zhuang\xE2\x80\x99s views on language, Alvin Plantinga\xE2\x80\x99s and Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s views on knowledge, and Aristotelian and Confucian virtue ethics. Merold Westphal responds to the piece on Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang (Laozi and Zhuangzi). Alvin Plantinga and Alasdair MacIntyre respond to the other two pieces respectively.</p>  \n\
  <p>It is not easy to do justice to such an array of thinkers in a brief review. This is comparative philosophy at its best, for the format of dialogue allows for deeper agreements and disagreements to surface and confrontational questions to be raised. Here I shall summarize the main points of each pair of essays and focus on those in which the disagreements open up new topics for future dialogues. When we read all the pieces together, some important common themes start to emerge. One major theme is the issue of whether it is legitimate to interpret Chinese philosophy in modern Western terms, i.e., terms outside of its own tradition. We may call this the question of hermeneutic legitimacy, which is a central issue in comparative philosophy. One may think that the question inevitably arises because we now live in an era of globalization, as Wang suggests in the title of the book. But I believe there are deeper reasons. What MacIntyre says about ethics applies equally to philosophy in general: \xE2\x80\x9CAll reflective ethics needs to develop, whether explicitly or implicitly, a comparative dimension\xE2\x80\x9D (152). In other words, it is impossible to do reflective philosophy, be it Chinese or Western, without in some way doing comparative philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>It is fitting that the editor starts the volume with Zhang Dainian and Kwong-loi Shun\xE2\x80\x99s dialogue on value theory in pre-modern China, because the dialogue focuses on the hermeneutic legitimacy question that keeps recurring throughout the rest of the book. Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s 1936 book <i>Key Concepts in Chinese Philosophy</i> represents one of the first efforts to use Western concepts to re-organize traditional Chinese metaphysics, cosmology, and epistemology (its English translation was published by Yale University Press in 2002). Years later, in the 1980s, Zhang wrote a series of papers spelling out his re-interpretation of pre-modern Chinese ethics in terms of theories of value. The piece included here is from this series. I shall mention his two major theses. The first is his semantic thesis that the term <i>gui</i> in pre-modern China means \xE2\x80\x9Cvalue\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>jiazhi</i>). The second is his substantive philosophical thesis that thinkers in pre-modern China have different theories of value in the sense that they have different ideas about the standards of value and how to rank different types of values. For example, Confucius and Mencius, according to Zhang, take moral virtues as having the highest value, and assign a much lower value to utility and profit, whereas Mozi turns the Confucian hierarchy of values up side down, ranking utility as the highest. This view of Chinese ethics, as well as Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s general approach of applying Western concepts to Chinese philosophy, has prevailed among Chinese scholars throughout the latter stages of the 20th century and down until the present day.</p>  \n\
  <p>In Shun\xE2\x80\x99s response, some refreshing cold water is thrown on this practice. Here we see the methodologically sophisticated sensibility that\xE2\x80\x99s already in display in Shun\xE2\x80\x99s important 1999 book on Mencius. Shun challenges a fundamental presupposition of Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s paper by asking whether the concept of value can be legitimately applied to pre-modern Chinese thinkers at all. Shun\xE2\x80\x99s question raises one\xE2\x80\x99s awareness of the legitimacy question and forces one to argue for one\xE2\x80\x99s hermeneutic practice explicitly; one does not have to agree with Shun\xE2\x80\x99s answer to appreciate it. Shun rejects both of Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s theses by arguing that, first, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhile early thinkers do use <i>gui</i> to steer their audience to a conception of what they regard as truly of high status, <i>gui</i> does not function in any way close to the modern term \xE2\x80\x99value\xE2\x80\x99 (<i>jiazhi</i>)\xE2\x80\x9D (41), and second, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is very unlikely that pre-modern Chinese thinkers are concerned with theories of value in Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s sense\xE2\x80\x9D (39).</p>  \n\
  <p>I think Shun is right to reject some parts of Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s theses. For instance, Shun shows very convincingly that, in the case of certain passages in the <i>Mencius</i>, Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s reading of them in terms of value theory is a distortion of what is really going on in the text. However, Shun might have overstated his conclusion. I believe that in the case of the <i>Mozi</i> the textual evidence actually supports Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s claim that Mozi has a utilitarian theory of value. But I agree with Shun that Zhang does not get the difference between Mencius and Mozi quite right. The difference is not that they have inverted hierarchies of values; their disagreement is much more radical. In <i>Mencius</i> 6A16-7, Mencius basically says that moral virtues are \xE2\x80\x9Cintrinsic values\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>liang-gui</i>), which are parts of one\xE2\x80\x99s true self. They can\xE2\x80\x99t be \xE2\x80\x9Cvalues\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>gui</i>) because values are subject to a person\xE2\x80\x99s arbitrary subjective preferences. This shows that the term \xE2\x80\x9C<i>gui</i>\xE2\x80\x9D in the <i>Mencius</i> is still used in the sense of subjective preferences (values). In other words, Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s semantic thesis might still be true, even though his philosophical thesis has to be rejected in the case of Mencius. Mencius\xE2\x80\x99 conception of <i>liang-gui</i> should remind us of Charles Taylor\xE2\x80\x99s conception of \xE2\x80\x9Cstrong evaluation,\xE2\x80\x9D which he also takes pains to differentiate from \xE2\x80\x9Cvalues.\xE2\x80\x9D For Confucius and Mencius, another reason why moral virtues (such as benevolence, justice, and ritual propriety) are not \xE2\x80\x9Cvalues,\xE2\x80\x9D but rather something beyond value, is because they believe that one can give up one\xE2\x80\x99s life for the sake of benevolence (<i>Analects</i>, 15.9) or justice and ritual (<i>Mencius</i> 3B1). Here one might recall Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s critique of value philosophy and his remark that no one ever dies for \xE2\x80\x9Cvalues.\xE2\x80\x9D I hope there will be more comparative analysis on this issue.</p>  \n\
  <p>The interactions in the other two pairs of essays in the first part of the book are not as confrontational as the Zhang-Shun dialogue. Let us first look at the exchange between Chen Lai and Bryan W. Van Norden. Chen\xE2\x80\x99s contribution is a chapter from his 1985 book on Zhu Xi (1130 \xE2\x80\x931200). This book is still one of the best studies on Zhu Xi, who created one of the most sophisticated and innovative philosophical systems that one can find. In his response, Van Norden does not address the substance of Chen\xE2\x80\x99s exposition of Zhu Xi\xE2\x80\x99s concepts of mind and nature; instead he raises two general questions that are not directly addressed by Chen in the chapter: (1) Does Zhu Xi\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy have anything to offer as a living philosophical position? (2) Does Zhu Xi get Confucius and Mencius right? His answer to (1) is \xE2\x80\x9Cyes\xE2\x80\x9D, and most of Van Norden\xE2\x80\x99s response is devoted to explaining this affirmative answer, which he backs up with compelling arguments. His answer to (2) is \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D. Following the eighteenth-century scholar Dai Zhen, Van Norden argues that the key term <i>li</i> (pattern) in Zhu Xi\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy never occurs in the <i>Analects</i>, and it means something quite different when it appears in the <i>Mencius</i>. He concludes that Zhu Xi\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy is a distortion of Confucius\xE2\x80\x99 and Mencius\xE2\x80\x99 original ideas. I don\xE2\x80\x99t think this is the end of the conversation; I believe that Chen could defend Zhu Xi, for Zhu Xi once responded to a similar question, which Chen has dealt with in his book. But I can\xE2\x80\x99t go into details here.</p>  \n\
  <p>In his short response to Zhao Dunhua\xE2\x80\x99s paper, Stephen Davis does not directly address Zhao\xE2\x80\x99s thesis that monotheism antedates polytheism in early China, but he raises some important methodological issues, a major one being whether Zhao\xE2\x80\x99s classification scheme (monotheism/henotheism/polytheism) is comprehensive and adequate when applied to the religions in the West. In the spirit of Shun\xE2\x80\x99s questioning, Davis could also have raised the more general legitimacy question of whether these Western terms are applicable to the religions in China.</p>  \n\
  <p>As one might expect, this question of hermeneutic legitimacy would become even more pressing when we move to the second part of the book, where Chinese and Western philosophers are directly compared in terms that are alien to their own traditions.</p>  \n\
  <p>Zhang Xianglong\xE2\x80\x99s comparative study of Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s and Lao-Zhuang\xE2\x80\x99s views of language was first published in 1996; similar arguments can be found in his influential book (in Chinese) on Heidegger and Daoism, which was based on his dissertation at SUNY, Buffalo. He is one of the first Chinese scholars to argue systematically for the affinities between Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang; his work represents some of the best work on comparative philosophy in China. In this paper, he first develops a four-fold scheme to classify different philosophical positions in terms of their attitudes towards the nature of language and ultimate reality; he then argues that Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang occupy the same position in the scheme he describes. First, with regard to the nature of language, there are two possible positions: language is either \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual representing\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cpre-conceptual representing.\xE2\x80\x9D With regard to the nature of ultimate reality, there are also two possible positions: reality is either a \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual entity\xE2\x80\x9D or a \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-conceptual entity.\xE2\x80\x9D Therefore, with regard to the nature of language and reality, there are four possible combinations of attitudes, the fourth one being that language is \xE2\x80\x9Cpre-conceptual representing\xE2\x80\x9D and reality is a \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-conceptual entity.\xE2\x80\x9D Zhang then argues that Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang share the fourth position. For them, language and reality are \xE2\x80\x9Cprior to concepts, names, and ideas\xE2\x80\x9D (210). They are \xE2\x80\x9Cprimordial language and primordial reality\xE2\x80\x9D and are not ontologically different from each other (208). Moreover, this \xE2\x80\x9Cprimordial language\xE2\x80\x9D is the language that \xE2\x80\x9C<i>Dao</i> speaks,\xE2\x80\x9D not the language we humans speak. This is why Zhang calls it \xE2\x80\x9C<i>dao</i>-language.\xE2\x80\x9D Zhang thinks that human language is \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual representing,\xE2\x80\x9D thus the \xE2\x80\x9Csuper-conceptual\xE2\x80\x9D <i>dao</i>-language is beyond the reach of our language that expresses \xE2\x80\x9Cconcepts and objects\xE2\x80\x9D (203-4).</p>  \n\
  <p>Westphal agrees with Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s conclusion that there is a \xE2\x80\x9Cprofound affinity\xE2\x80\x9D between Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang: both believe that \xE2\x80\x9Cwe are called by a language which comes to us from beyond the reach of our own language\xE2\x80\x9D (221). But Westphal raises some extremely important questions by bringing in the case of Augustine. Augustine also believes in a call that comes from beyond the reach of our own language, but for him, the call comes literally from a personal caller: \xE2\x80\x9Cthe claim that God speaks is a literal claim and not a metaphor. There is a call because there is a caller\xE2\x80\x9D (224). However, this is not the case in Heidegger or Lao-Zhuang. For example, when Zhang utters the statement \xE2\x80\x9CDao speaks,\xE2\x80\x9D he can only mean it metaphorically. Westphal also offers a stronger, ethical critique: \xE2\x80\x9CMy question is whether they [Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang] have properly identified the voice that calls. Is it possible that it is the voice of God who is so eminently personal that we can speak literally and not metaphorically about divine speech? And is it possible that such a personal God is love itself and for that reason commands us to love each other in ways that Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang have not clearly heard?\xE2\x80\x9D (226).</p>  \n\
  <p>Here I shall not guess how Zhang would respond to Westphal\xE2\x80\x99s critique; instead I want to raise a question about Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s argument. If we follow the spirit of Shun\xE2\x80\x99s and Davis\xE2\x80\x99s hermeneutic questioning, we should ask whether Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s four-fold scheme is adequate in the first place. It seems that when Zhang talks about regarding language as \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual representing,\xE2\x80\x9D he does not realize that this is a combination of two attitudes: regarding language as \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual\xE2\x80\x9D <i>and</i> as \xE2\x80\x9Crepresenting.\xE2\x80\x9D He seems to assume that if something is conceptual, it must be representational as well. He has thus left out a possible position of taking language as conceptual but not representational. A recent example of this position is Robert Brandom, who argues that human language is always conceptual but not necessarily representational, and that Heidegger holds this view as well. I believe one can also find this view in Donald Davidson and Gadamer. Moreover, both Davidson and Gadamer explicitly emphasize that we should reject the \xE2\x80\x9Clanguage and world\xE2\x80\x9D dualism, and the corresponding concept of a non-conceptual reality, which is the main source of relativism and skepticism. As many scholars have argued, this is also a point that Heidegger emphasizes. My question is then the following: Since Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang share so many things with Brandom, Davidson, and Gadamer, is it possible that their real position on language is rather that language is conceptual but non-representational? If this is indeed the case, perhaps the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cprimordial language\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9C<i>dao</i>-language\xE2\x80\x9D is not some remote and mysterious \xE2\x80\x9Coriginal, pure region of language\xE2\x80\x9D (210), but our own human language?</p>  \n\
  <p>Kelly Clark and Liu Zongkun\xE2\x80\x99s project in their paper is to compare Zhuangzi with Plantinga, a philosopher who is very different from Heidegger. Clark and Liu find some surprising structural similarities between their views on knowledge. For example, both Zhuangzi and Plantinga believe that knowledge of reality is not produced by reason or senses, and that there is natural knowledge of reality produced by natural dispositions.</p>  \n\
  <p>The initially skeptical Plantinga is convinced by Clark and Liu that this is indeed a good comparative project. Plantinga agrees with their reading of his own Reformed epistemology, but he disagrees with their reading of Zhuangzi as non-skeptic, arguing that Zhuangzi holds a limited form of skepticism. He also reiterates his well-known argument that it is <i>rational</i> to believe in the Christian God even though there is no evidence for it and there are other people who disagree with it.</p>  \n\
  <p>Here I shall not dispute Clark and Liu\xE2\x80\x99s reading of Plantinga. I want to raise a question about the nature of the similarities they claim exist between Zhuangzi and Plantinga. They state their conclusion in the following way: \xE2\x80\x9CAlthough we can\xE2\x80\x99t be certain, both authors maintain that we can grasp enough of the truth, through our natural dispositions, to properly order our lives in accord with the truth. With mirrors polished through the renunciation of self our natural heart/minds reflect the Way\xE2\x80\x9D (181). I think they would acknowledge that, even though Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s and Plantinga\xE2\x80\x99s theories of natural knowledge are <i>structurally</i> similar, the <i>contents</i> of the natural knowledge are different for them. For Zhuangzi, it is the belief in Dao, whereas for Plantinga, it\xE2\x80\x99s the belief in God. The question then is: How can a piece of knowledge be \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural\xE2\x80\x9D if its content varies from time to time, from person to person, and place to place? We normally call such knowledge \xE2\x80\x9Chistorical\xE2\x80\x9D rather than \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge. To use the metaphor mentioned above, how can the \xE2\x80\x9Cpolished mirror,\xE2\x80\x9D which is supposed to reflect <i>the</i> truth, reflect different things, depending on who is looking into it?</p>  \n\
  <p>The structural similarities between Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s and Plantinga\xE2\x80\x99s epistemological theories of natural knowledge seem to be quite superficial, because the contents of natural knowledge also appear in their theories. For example, the following is Clark and Liu\xE2\x80\x99s formulation of Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s theory: \xE2\x80\x9Cthe belief in the Dao is a kind of natural knowledge, based on the natural state of human mind under the restorative effects of the Dao\xE2\x80\x9D (174). In other words, the natural knowledge of Dao is produced by Dao. Since the term \xE2\x80\x9Cdao\xE2\x80\x9D in the <i>Zhuangzi</i> means \xE2\x80\x9Cpatterns of nature,\xE2\x80\x9D Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s theory is really that our knowledge of the patterns of nature is produced by the patterns of nature. In such a \xE2\x80\x9Cnaturalist\xE2\x80\x9D theory of knowledge, there seems no room for Plantinga\xE2\x80\x99s Christian God. Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cnaturalism\xE2\x80\x9D turns out to be dangerously similar to the kind of naturalism that Plantinga has recently been trying to defeat.</p>  \n\
  <p>In what sense can we still say that Zhuangzi and Plantinga have similar theories of natural knowledge? Is it possible that Clark and Liu misread Zhuangzi as similar to Plantinga because they assume that \xE2\x80\x9CThe Dao is Creator\xE2\x80\x9D (165), an idea that actually cannot be found in the <i>Zhuangzi</i>? (Westphal and Zhang Xianglong, both believing that <i>dao</i> is not a personal caller like God, should be invited to join the discussion here.) It is one of the great merits of the dialogue between Clark-Liu and Plantinga that issues like this are being discovered, for they shed new light on important aspects of both Zhuangzi and Plantinga.</p>  \n\
  <p>Wan Junren\xE2\x80\x99s and MacIntyre\xE2\x80\x99s articles are the longest and in some ways the richest in the book. They are well-matched: Wan is the Chinese translator of MacIntyre\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Whose Justice? Which Rationality?</i> and <i>Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry</i>, and MacIntyre might be the only prominent moral philosopher in the West who has written on Confucian ethics and Japanese ethics. For lack of space, I shall only mention one major point in this extremely interesting exchange. Wan\xE2\x80\x99s thesis is that the main difference between Aristotelian ethics and traditional Confucian ethics is that the former has the conception of the individual as the \xE2\x80\x9Csubject\xE2\x80\x9D (132), or a \xE2\x80\x9CWestern-style \xE2\x80\x99individual\xE2\x80\x99 bearing rights and constituting its own <i>telos</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (130), whereas the latter does not have such a concept: \xE2\x80\x9CConfucian ethics clearly lacks the sort of independent, substantial entity called the \xE2\x80\x99individual\xE2\x80\x99 that we find in Aristotle or Western ethics as a whole\xE2\x80\x9D (125). However, Wan does not provide adequate textual evidence to substantiate his claims; for example, the idea that individuals constitute their own <i>teloi</i> can\xE2\x80\x99t possibly be Aristotelian. Wan seems to be reading modern Western individualism and subjectivism into Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s ethics. He tends to see Western ethics as an unchanging whole; he is then able to put it in sharp contrast with Confucian ethics. This might be why he often uses \xE2\x80\x9CAristotle\xE2\x80\x99s ethics,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CAristotelian ethics,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CWestern ethics\xE2\x80\x9D interchangeably.</p>  \n\
  <p>In his response, MacIntyre argues that Aristotelianism and Confucianism are somewhat closer than Wan believes. First, he says, \xE2\x80\x9CAristotle\xE2\x80\x99s conception of the moral agent is similarly at odds with such distinctively modern Western conceptions of the individual\xE2\x80\x9D (154); second, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe Confucian views seems to be more deeply committed to an account of individuals as having a substantial reality than Professor Wan always recognizes\xE2\x80\x9D (154). The first point is a familiar story now, so MacIntyre focuses mainly on the second point. He backs it up with textual evidence, giving a masterful interpretation of certain passages from the <i>Analects</i>. I am convinced that both of his points are true.</p>  \n\
  <p>If we take this exchange as purely academic, this should settle the issue. However, if we read Wan\xE2\x80\x99s piece in its contemporary Chinese context, we can sense between the lines that there is a deeper concern about the current political situation in China. Wan\xE2\x80\x99s real anxiety seems to be that the Confucian tradition is responsible for the lack of individual human rights in China. So even if Wan accepts MacIntyre\xE2\x80\x99s point that Confucian tradition is \xE2\x80\x9Cmore deeply committed to an account of individuals as having a substantial reality\xE2\x80\x9D than he recognizes, this won\xE2\x80\x99t be enough for Wan, because the commitment is not deep enough to produce a conception of individual rights.</p>  \n\
  <p>This lack of attention to the political context of Chinese philosophy, as well as the surprising absence of any work directly on Chinese political philosophy, might be the only weakness of this fine volume. There has been some really exciting work in political philosophy published in China recently; I hope that there will be a sequel to this volume, bringing Western and Chinese political philosophers into conversations with one another. This book has already set up a terrific model for such projects, and it has indeed fulfilled its promise of opening up \xE2\x80\x9Cnew possibilities for intriguing and meaningful philosophical exchange.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>"

transformed_content: "\xE2\x80\x80\n\
  <p>The editor of this splendid volume, Robin Wang, has hit upon the great idea of inviting American philosophers to respond to their Chinese colleagues\xE2\x80\x99 work. Six influential papers and book chapters published in Chinese in the 1980s and 90s are expertly translated into English; they then are commented on by six American philosophers. The book covers a broad range of topics and is divided into two parts. The first consists of three leading Chinese scholars\xE2\x80\x99 pieces on issues in the history of Chinese philosophy and religion: the theory of value in pre-modern China, the concepts of mind and nature in Zhu Xi (one of the most important Confucian philosophers), and polytheism in early China. They are commented on by two leading American scholars in Chinese philosophy, Kwong-loi Shun and Bryan W. Van Norden, and a philosopher of religion, Stephen Davis. The second part consists of three comparative studies: Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s and Lao-Zhuang\xE2\x80\x99s views on language, Alvin Plantinga\xE2\x80\x99s and Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s views on knowledge, and Aristotelian and Confucian virtue ethics. Merold Westphal responds to the piece on Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang (Laozi and Zhuangzi). Alvin Plantinga and Alasdair MacIntyre respond to the other two pieces respectively.</p>  \n\
  <p>It is not easy to do justice to such an array of thinkers in a brief review. This is comparative philosophy at its best, for the format of dialogue allows for deeper agreements and disagreements to surface and confrontational questions to be raised. Here I shall summarize the main points of each pair of essays and focus on those in which the disagreements open up new topics for future dialogues. When we read all the pieces together, some important common themes start to emerge. One major theme is the issue of whether it is legitimate to interpret Chinese philosophy in modern Western terms, i.e., terms outside of its own tradition. We may call this the question of hermeneutic legitimacy, which is a central issue in comparative philosophy. One may think that the question inevitably arises because we now live in an era of globalization, as Wang suggests in the title of the book. But I believe there are deeper reasons. What MacIntyre says about ethics applies equally to philosophy in general: \xE2\x80\x9CAll reflective ethics needs to develop, whether explicitly or implicitly, a comparative dimension\xE2\x80\x9D (152). In other words, it is impossible to do reflective philosophy, be it Chinese or Western, without in some way doing comparative philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>It is fitting that the editor starts the volume with Zhang Dainian and Kwong-loi Shun\xE2\x80\x99s dialogue on value theory in pre-modern China, because the dialogue focuses on the hermeneutic legitimacy question that keeps recurring throughout the rest of the book. Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s 1936 book <i>Key Concepts in Chinese Philosophy</i> represents one of the first efforts to use Western concepts to re-organize traditional Chinese metaphysics, cosmology, and epistemology (its English translation was published by Yale University Press in 2002). Years later, in the 1980s, Zhang wrote a series of papers spelling out his re-interpretation of pre-modern Chinese ethics in terms of theories of value. The piece included here is from this series. I shall mention his two major theses. The first is his semantic thesis that the term <i>gui</i> in pre-modern China means \xE2\x80\x9Cvalue\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>jiazhi</i>). The second is his substantive philosophical thesis that thinkers in pre-modern China have different theories of value in the sense that they have different ideas about the standards of value and how to rank different types of values. For example, Confucius and Mencius, according to Zhang, take moral virtues as having the highest value, and assign a much lower value to utility and profit, whereas Mozi turns the Confucian hierarchy of values up side down, ranking utility as the highest. This view of Chinese ethics, as well as Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s general approach of applying Western concepts to Chinese philosophy, has prevailed among Chinese scholars throughout the latter stages of the 20th century and down until the present day.</p>  \n\
  <p>In Shun\xE2\x80\x99s response, some refreshing cold water is thrown on this practice. Here we see the methodologically sophisticated sensibility that\xE2\x80\x99s already in display in Shun\xE2\x80\x99s important 1999 book on Mencius. Shun challenges a fundamental presupposition of Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s paper by asking whether the concept of value can be legitimately applied to pre-modern Chinese thinkers at all. Shun\xE2\x80\x99s question raises one\xE2\x80\x99s awareness of the legitimacy question and forces one to argue for one\xE2\x80\x99s hermeneutic practice explicitly; one does not have to agree with Shun\xE2\x80\x99s answer to appreciate it. Shun rejects both of Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s theses by arguing that, first, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhile early thinkers do use <i>gui</i> to steer their audience to a conception of what they regard as truly of high status, <i>gui</i> does not function in any way close to the modern term \xE2\x80\x99value\xE2\x80\x99 (<i>jiazhi</i>)\xE2\x80\x9D (41), and second, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is very unlikely that pre-modern Chinese thinkers are concerned with theories of value in Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s sense\xE2\x80\x9D (39).</p>  \n\
  <p>I think Shun is right to reject some parts of Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s theses. For instance, Shun shows very convincingly that, in the case of certain passages in the <i>Mencius</i>, Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s reading of them in terms of value theory is a distortion of what is really going on in the text. However, Shun might have overstated his conclusion. I believe that in the case of the <i>Mozi</i> the textual evidence actually supports Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s claim that Mozi has a utilitarian theory of value. But I agree with Shun that Zhang does not get the difference between Mencius and Mozi quite right. The difference is not that they have inverted hierarchies of values; their disagreement is much more radical. In <i>Mencius</i> 6A16-7, Mencius basically says that moral virtues are \xE2\x80\x9Cintrinsic values\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>liang-gui</i>), which are parts of one\xE2\x80\x99s true self. They can\xE2\x80\x99t be \xE2\x80\x9Cvalues\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>gui</i>) because values are subject to a person\xE2\x80\x99s arbitrary subjective preferences. This shows that the term \xE2\x80\x9C<i>gui</i>\xE2\x80\x9D in the <i>Mencius</i> is still used in the sense of subjective preferences (values). In other words, Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s semantic thesis might still be true, even though his philosophical thesis has to be rejected in the case of Mencius. Mencius\xE2\x80\x99 conception of <i>liang-gui</i> should remind us of Charles Taylor\xE2\x80\x99s conception of \xE2\x80\x9Cstrong evaluation,\xE2\x80\x9D which he also takes pains to differentiate from \xE2\x80\x9Cvalues.\xE2\x80\x9D For Confucius and Mencius, another reason why moral virtues (such as benevolence, justice, and ritual propriety) are not \xE2\x80\x9Cvalues,\xE2\x80\x9D but rather something beyond value, is because they believe that one can give up one\xE2\x80\x99s life for the sake of benevolence (<i>Analects</i>, 15.9) or justice and ritual (<i>Mencius</i> 3B1). Here one might recall Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s critique of value philosophy and his remark that no one ever dies for \xE2\x80\x9Cvalues.\xE2\x80\x9D I hope there will be more comparative analysis on this issue.</p>  \n\
  <p>The interactions in the other two pairs of essays in the first part of the book are not as confrontational as the Zhang-Shun dialogue. Let us first look at the exchange between Chen Lai and Bryan W. Van Norden. Chen\xE2\x80\x99s contribution is a chapter from his 1985 book on Zhu Xi (1130 \xE2\x80\x931200). This book is still one of the best studies on Zhu Xi, who created one of the most sophisticated and innovative philosophical systems that one can find. In his response, Van Norden does not address the substance of Chen\xE2\x80\x99s exposition of Zhu Xi\xE2\x80\x99s concepts of mind and nature; instead he raises two general questions that are not directly addressed by Chen in the chapter: (1) Does Zhu Xi\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy have anything to offer as a living philosophical position? (2) Does Zhu Xi get Confucius and Mencius right? His answer to (1) is \xE2\x80\x9Cyes\xE2\x80\x9D, and most of Van Norden\xE2\x80\x99s response is devoted to explaining this affirmative answer, which he backs up with compelling arguments. His answer to (2) is \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D. Following the eighteenth-century scholar Dai Zhen, Van Norden argues that the key term <i>li</i> (pattern) in Zhu Xi\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy never occurs in the <i>Analects</i>, and it means something quite different when it appears in the <i>Mencius</i>. He concludes that Zhu Xi\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy is a distortion of Confucius\xE2\x80\x99 and Mencius\xE2\x80\x99 original ideas. I don\xE2\x80\x99t think this is the end of the conversation; I believe that Chen could defend Zhu Xi, for Zhu Xi once responded to a similar question, which Chen has dealt with in his book. But I can\xE2\x80\x99t go into details here.</p>  \n\
  <p>In his short response to Zhao Dunhua\xE2\x80\x99s paper, Stephen Davis does not directly address Zhao\xE2\x80\x99s thesis that monotheism antedates polytheism in early China, but he raises some important methodological issues, a major one being whether Zhao\xE2\x80\x99s classification scheme (monotheism/henotheism/polytheism) is comprehensive and adequate when applied to the religions in the West. In the spirit of Shun\xE2\x80\x99s questioning, Davis could also have raised the more general legitimacy question of whether these Western terms are applicable to the religions in China.</p>  \n\
  <p>As one might expect, this question of hermeneutic legitimacy would become even more pressing when we move to the second part of the book, where Chinese and Western philosophers are directly compared in terms that are alien to their own traditions.</p>  \n\
  <p>Zhang Xianglong\xE2\x80\x99s comparative study of Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s and Lao-Zhuang\xE2\x80\x99s views of language was first published in 1996; similar arguments can be found in his influential book (in Chinese) on Heidegger and Daoism, which was based on his dissertation at SUNY, Buffalo. He is one of the first Chinese scholars to argue systematically for the affinities between Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang; his work represents some of the best work on comparative philosophy in China. In this paper, he first develops a four-fold scheme to classify different philosophical positions in terms of their attitudes towards the nature of language and ultimate reality; he then argues that Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang occupy the same position in the scheme he describes. First, with regard to the nature of language, there are two possible positions: language is either \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual representing\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cpre-conceptual representing.\xE2\x80\x9D With regard to the nature of ultimate reality, there are also two possible positions: reality is either a \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual entity\xE2\x80\x9D or a \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-conceptual entity.\xE2\x80\x9D Therefore, with regard to the nature of language and reality, there are four possible combinations of attitudes, the fourth one being that language is \xE2\x80\x9Cpre-conceptual representing\xE2\x80\x9D and reality is a \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-conceptual entity.\xE2\x80\x9D Zhang then argues that Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang share the fourth position. For them, language and reality are \xE2\x80\x9Cprior to concepts, names, and ideas\xE2\x80\x9D (210). They are \xE2\x80\x9Cprimordial language and primordial reality\xE2\x80\x9D and are not ontologically different from each other (208). Moreover, this \xE2\x80\x9Cprimordial language\xE2\x80\x9D is the language that \xE2\x80\x9C<i>Dao</i> speaks,\xE2\x80\x9D not the language we humans speak. This is why Zhang calls it \xE2\x80\x9C<i>dao</i>-language.\xE2\x80\x9D Zhang thinks that human language is \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual representing,\xE2\x80\x9D thus the \xE2\x80\x9Csuper-conceptual\xE2\x80\x9D <i>dao</i>-language is beyond the reach of our language that expresses \xE2\x80\x9Cconcepts and objects\xE2\x80\x9D (203-4).</p>  \n\
  <p>Westphal agrees with Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s conclusion that there is a \xE2\x80\x9Cprofound affinity\xE2\x80\x9D between Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang: both believe that \xE2\x80\x9Cwe are called by a language which comes to us from beyond the reach of our own language\xE2\x80\x9D (221). But Westphal raises some extremely important questions by bringing in the case of Augustine. Augustine also believes in a call that comes from beyond the reach of our own language, but for him, the call comes literally from a personal caller: \xE2\x80\x9Cthe claim that God speaks is a literal claim and not a metaphor. There is a call because there is a caller\xE2\x80\x9D (224). However, this is not the case in Heidegger or Lao-Zhuang. For example, when Zhang utters the statement \xE2\x80\x9CDao speaks,\xE2\x80\x9D he can only mean it metaphorically. Westphal also offers a stronger, ethical critique: \xE2\x80\x9CMy question is whether they [Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang] have properly identified the voice that calls. Is it possible that it is the voice of God who is so eminently personal that we can speak literally and not metaphorically about divine speech? And is it possible that such a personal God is love itself and for that reason commands us to love each other in ways that Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang have not clearly heard?\xE2\x80\x9D (226).</p>  \n\
  <p>Here I shall not guess how Zhang would respond to Westphal\xE2\x80\x99s critique; instead I want to raise a question about Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s argument. If we follow the spirit of Shun\xE2\x80\x99s and Davis\xE2\x80\x99s hermeneutic questioning, we should ask whether Zhang\xE2\x80\x99s four-fold scheme is adequate in the first place. It seems that when Zhang talks about regarding language as \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual representing,\xE2\x80\x9D he does not realize that this is a combination of two attitudes: regarding language as \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual\xE2\x80\x9D <i>and</i> as \xE2\x80\x9Crepresenting.\xE2\x80\x9D He seems to assume that if something is conceptual, it must be representational as well. He has thus left out a possible position of taking language as conceptual but not representational. A recent example of this position is Robert Brandom, who argues that human language is always conceptual but not necessarily representational, and that Heidegger holds this view as well. I believe one can also find this view in Donald Davidson and Gadamer. Moreover, both Davidson and Gadamer explicitly emphasize that we should reject the \xE2\x80\x9Clanguage and world\xE2\x80\x9D dualism, and the corresponding concept of a non-conceptual reality, which is the main source of relativism and skepticism. As many scholars have argued, this is also a point that Heidegger emphasizes. My question is then the following: Since Heidegger and Lao-Zhuang share so many things with Brandom, Davidson, and Gadamer, is it possible that their real position on language is rather that language is conceptual but non-representational? If this is indeed the case, perhaps the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cprimordial language\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9C<i>dao</i>-language\xE2\x80\x9D is not some remote and mysterious \xE2\x80\x9Coriginal, pure region of language\xE2\x80\x9D (210), but our own human language?</p>  \n\
  <p>Kelly Clark and Liu Zongkun\xE2\x80\x99s project in their paper is to compare Zhuangzi with Plantinga, a philosopher who is very different from Heidegger. Clark and Liu find some surprising structural similarities between their views on knowledge. For example, both Zhuangzi and Plantinga believe that knowledge of reality is not produced by reason or senses, and that there is natural knowledge of reality produced by natural dispositions.</p>  \n\
  <p>The initially skeptical Plantinga is convinced by Clark and Liu that this is indeed a good comparative project. Plantinga agrees with their reading of his own Reformed epistemology, but he disagrees with their reading of Zhuangzi as non-skeptic, arguing that Zhuangzi holds a limited form of skepticism. He also reiterates his well-known argument that it is <i>rational</i> to believe in the Christian God even though there is no evidence for it and there are other people who disagree with it.</p>  \n\
  <p>Here I shall not dispute Clark and Liu\xE2\x80\x99s reading of Plantinga. I want to raise a question about the nature of the similarities they claim exist between Zhuangzi and Plantinga. They state their conclusion in the following way: \xE2\x80\x9CAlthough we can\xE2\x80\x99t be certain, both authors maintain that we can grasp enough of the truth, through our natural dispositions, to properly order our lives in accord with the truth. With mirrors polished through the renunciation of self our natural heart/minds reflect the Way\xE2\x80\x9D (181). I think they would acknowledge that, even though Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s and Plantinga\xE2\x80\x99s theories of natural knowledge are <i>structurally</i> similar, the <i>contents</i> of the natural knowledge are different for them. For Zhuangzi, it is the belief in Dao, whereas for Plantinga, it\xE2\x80\x99s the belief in God. The question then is: How can a piece of knowledge be \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural\xE2\x80\x9D if its content varies from time to time, from person to person, and place to place? We normally call such knowledge \xE2\x80\x9Chistorical\xE2\x80\x9D rather than \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge. To use the metaphor mentioned above, how can the \xE2\x80\x9Cpolished mirror,\xE2\x80\x9D which is supposed to reflect <i>the</i> truth, reflect different things, depending on who is looking into it?</p>  \n\
  <p>The structural similarities between Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s and Plantinga\xE2\x80\x99s epistemological theories of natural knowledge seem to be quite superficial, because the contents of natural knowledge also appear in their theories. For example, the following is Clark and Liu\xE2\x80\x99s formulation of Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s theory: \xE2\x80\x9Cthe belief in the Dao is a kind of natural knowledge, based on the natural state of human mind under the restorative effects of the Dao\xE2\x80\x9D (174). In other words, the natural knowledge of Dao is produced by Dao. Since the term \xE2\x80\x9Cdao\xE2\x80\x9D in the <i>Zhuangzi</i> means \xE2\x80\x9Cpatterns of nature,\xE2\x80\x9D Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s theory is really that our knowledge of the patterns of nature is produced by the patterns of nature. In such a \xE2\x80\x9Cnaturalist\xE2\x80\x9D theory of knowledge, there seems no room for Plantinga\xE2\x80\x99s Christian God. Zhuangzi\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cnaturalism\xE2\x80\x9D turns out to be dangerously similar to the kind of naturalism that Plantinga has recently been trying to defeat.</p>  \n\
  <p>In what sense can we still say that Zhuangzi and Plantinga have similar theories of natural knowledge? Is it possible that Clark and Liu misread Zhuangzi as similar to Plantinga because they assume that \xE2\x80\x9CThe Dao is Creator\xE2\x80\x9D (165), an idea that actually cannot be found in the <i>Zhuangzi</i>? (Westphal and Zhang Xianglong, both believing that <i>dao</i> is not a personal caller like God, should be invited to join the discussion here.) It is one of the great merits of the dialogue between Clark-Liu and Plantinga that issues like this are being discovered, for they shed new light on important aspects of both Zhuangzi and Plantinga.</p>  \n\
  <p>Wan Junren\xE2\x80\x99s and MacIntyre\xE2\x80\x99s articles are the longest and in some ways the richest in the book. They are well-matched: Wan is the Chinese translator of MacIntyre\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Whose Justice? Which Rationality?</i> and <i>Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry</i>, and MacIntyre might be the only prominent moral philosopher in the West who has written on Confucian ethics and Japanese ethics. For lack of space, I shall only mention one major point in this extremely interesting exchange. Wan\xE2\x80\x99s thesis is that the main difference between Aristotelian ethics and traditional Confucian ethics is that the former has the conception of the individual as the \xE2\x80\x9Csubject\xE2\x80\x9D (132), or a \xE2\x80\x9CWestern-style \xE2\x80\x99individual\xE2\x80\x99 bearing rights and constituting its own <i>telos</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (130), whereas the latter does not have such a concept: \xE2\x80\x9CConfucian ethics clearly lacks the sort of independent, substantial entity called the \xE2\x80\x99individual\xE2\x80\x99 that we find in Aristotle or Western ethics as a whole\xE2\x80\x9D (125). However, Wan does not provide adequate textual evidence to substantiate his claims; for example, the idea that individuals constitute their own <i>teloi</i> can\xE2\x80\x99t possibly be Aristotelian. Wan seems to be reading modern Western individualism and subjectivism into Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s ethics. He tends to see Western ethics as an unchanging whole; he is then able to put it in sharp contrast with Confucian ethics. This might be why he often uses \xE2\x80\x9CAristotle\xE2\x80\x99s ethics,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CAristotelian ethics,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CWestern ethics\xE2\x80\x9D interchangeably.</p>  \n\
  <p>In his response, MacIntyre argues that Aristotelianism and Confucianism are somewhat closer than Wan believes. First, he says, \xE2\x80\x9CAristotle\xE2\x80\x99s conception of the moral agent is similarly at odds with such distinctively modern Western conceptions of the individual\xE2\x80\x9D (154); second, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe Confucian views seems to be more deeply committed to an account of individuals as having a substantial reality than Professor Wan always recognizes\xE2\x80\x9D (154). The first point is a familiar story now, so MacIntyre focuses mainly on the second point. He backs it up with textual evidence, giving a masterful interpretation of certain passages from the <i>Analects</i>. I am convinced that both of his points are true.</p>  \n\
  <p>If we take this exchange as purely academic, this should settle the issue. However, if we read Wan\xE2\x80\x99s piece in its contemporary Chinese context, we can sense between the lines that there is a deeper concern about the current political situation in China. Wan\xE2\x80\x99s real anxiety seems to be that the Confucian tradition is responsible for the lack of individual human rights in China. So even if Wan accepts MacIntyre\xE2\x80\x99s point that Confucian tradition is \xE2\x80\x9Cmore deeply committed to an account of individuals as having a substantial reality\xE2\x80\x9D than he recognizes, this won\xE2\x80\x99t be enough for Wan, because the commitment is not deep enough to produce a conception of individual rights.</p>  \n\
  <p>This lack of attention to the political context of Chinese philosophy, as well as the surprising absence of any work directly on Chinese political philosophy, might be the only weakness of this fine volume. There has been some really exciting work in political philosophy published in China recently; I hope that there will be a sequel to this volume, bringing Western and Chinese political philosophers into conversations with one another. This book has already set up a terrific model for such projects, and it has indeed fulfilled its promise of opening up \xE2\x80\x9Cnew possibilities for intriguing and meaningful philosophical exchange.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>"
