Schall).</p>  \n\
  <p>Given the terms of the book's dedication, the first question to ask is: What is the \xE2\x80\x9CGilsonian method\xE2\x80\x9D? Robert Delfino's article summarizes Maurer's 1983 book, <i>About Beauty: A Thomistic Interpretation</i>. But this book is perhaps not the best instance of Maurer applying the \xE2\x80\x9CGilsonian method\xE2\x80\x9D of historical scholarship; in it, Maurer attempts a metaphysical synthesis and Thomistic prolongation rather than the uncovering and interpretation of the historical sources of Aquinas's scattered remarks about beauty: beauty is a transcendental property of being, differing from being only in notion; it is a pleasing intellectual vision of the <i>claritas, consonantia, integritas</i> \xE2\x80\x9Cradiating\xE2\x80\x9D from a thing's form (cf. <i>ST,</i> I, q. 5, a. 4, ad 1).  In <i>The Arts of the Beautiful</i>, Gilson, using a neologism incorporating the Greek term <i>kalos</i> (beauty), called this kind of metaphysics of transcendental beauty a \xE2\x80\x9Ccalology,\xE2\x80\x9D which he then carefully distinguished both from \xE2\x80\x9Caesthetics,\xE2\x80\x9D the theory of how artistic beauty is perceived, and the \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy of art,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cthe theory of how works of art are made.\xE2\x80\x9D The distinctions were controversial. Gilson and Maritain, although presumably they agreed about the metaphysical elements of Aquinas's \xE2\x80\x9Ccalology,\xE2\x80\x9D had lengthy, disputatious, and rather personally embittered exchanges, so Francesca Murphy recounts, about the possibility and manner of distinguishing the other two philosophical theories about art.</p>  \n\
  <p>Jorge Gracia, who himself has written astutely about the variant philosophical uses of the history of philosophy, irenically labels Gilson's historical method \xE2\x80\x9Cthe enlightening gloss.\xE2\x80\x9D According to Gracia, Gilson's primary purpose was to understand the text of an historical author by understanding the \xE2\x80\x9Ccontroversies, issues and views common when it was produced\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 2). Typically, Gilson glosses his focal texts by (1) using a battery of philosophical concepts\xE2\x80\x94that are not always sufficiently explained, so Gracia judges\xE2\x80\x94to interpret them; (2) having his own explicit philosophical criterion by which to evaluate them; (3) simplifying or reducing textual and conceptual complexities to the main philosophical issue raised in the focal text(s). In short, Gilson's enlightening gloss is \xE2\x80\x9Can explanatory paraphrase\xE2\x80\x9D of the sort that so-called contemporary \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic Thomists,\xE2\x80\x9D who are fond of minute logical reconstructions of Aquinas's arguments, largely eschew. Gracia contends, correctly, that Gilson narrated the history of philosophy as one long <i>praeparatio</i> for and one long <i>declinatio</i> from Aquinas: in particular, from Aquinas's \xE2\x80\x9Cexistentialism\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94linguistically marked by the Latin infinitive of the verb \xE2\x80\x9Cto be\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94the metaphysics of <i>esse</i>.  Gilson famously opined that Aquinas, inspired by what the saint himself called (<i>SCG,</i> I, c. 22; Pera, 2: 33a, n. 211) \xE2\x80\x9Cthe sublime truth\xE2\x80\x9D that God revealed to Moses, recorded in Exodus, 3.13 (<i>\xE2\x80\x9CEgo sum qui sum,</i>\xE2\x80\x9D in the Latin translation familiar to Aquinas), came to a historically unique understanding of the divine name that, Gilson held, was the keystone of Thomistic metaphysics: the divine essence is identical with <i>ipsum esse subsistens</i>, and that the finite <i>actus essendi</i> which participates the divine <i>esse</i> is the foundational actuality of all created natures.</p>  \n\
  <p>Gracia does not mention, however, that Gilson's narrative alleging the revealed source and the historical uniqueness of the Thomistic metaphysical insight has been plausibly challenged by Hadot and other scholars, who trace the Thomistic <i>ipsum esse subsistens</i> doctrine through the medieval neo-Platonist tradition\xE2\x80\x94mediated to Aquinas by Pseudo-Dionysius, Boethius, and Proclus\xE2\x80\x94back to an anonymous commentary (probably by Porphyry) on Plato's <i>Parmenides</i>. For the anonymous commentator, the first principle is not, in typical neo-Platonist fashion, \xE2\x80\x9Cbeyond being\xE2\x80\x9D but is pure activity (<i>auto to en\xC3\xA9rgein</i>) whose nature is designated by the infinitive <i>auto to e\xC3\xAEnai</i>. Hadot's alternative account raises many questions, which have been put in the form of a direct challenge by Wayne Hankey, about the soundness of Gilson's historical views. If Hadot and Hankey are correct, Gilson was wrong about the historical uniqueness and biblical source of Aquinas's <i>esse</i> metaphysics.</p>  \n\
  <p>So too, questions about how historical method should be used and what it reveals in philosophy\xE2\x80\x94Is the history of philosophy focused on the chains of essentially or necessarily connected ideas or on contingent and self-contained, radically personalized insights?\xE2\x80\x94underlie the rather spun-out but worthwhile article that Richard Fafara devotes to the relationship between Gilson and his doctoral student Henri Gouhier (1898-1994). Gouhier's student thesis (<i>La pens\xC3\xA9e religieuse de Descartes</i>), the product of a seminar with Gilson, was published and awarded a prize by the <i>Academie fran\xC3\xA7aise</i> in 1924. In his thesis, Gouhier rejected any temporally fixed or abstractly global portrait of Descartes's thought; instead, he presented Cartesian philosophy biographically as a succession of recastings which reinvented for diverse audiences Descartes's earliest themes. Gilson, while remaining unconvinced by some of Gouhier's particular claims (especially Descartes's alleged affinities with Thomism rather than, as scholarly convention held, the Augustinianism of the seventeenth century French Oratory), nonetheless, praised his student's method as Aristotelian as well as properly historical: Gouhier's interpretative focus, biographical rather than systematic, moves from Descartes's concrete actions to cautious speculations about Descartes's (for Gilson irretrievably) hidden motives. Though Gouhier became a life-long friend and eminent colleague, the erstwhile student never agreed with his former ma\xC3\xAEtre about the nature and end of historical method. Their disagreements conspicuously surfaced in their respective interpretations of Malebranche.</p>  \n\
  <p>For Gilson, Malebranche was not just, in some vague sense, a \xE2\x80\x9Creligious philosopher\xE2\x80\x9D but an Augustinian, who, like his thirteenth century predecessors (especially Bonaventure), regarded Aristotle as pagan and Aristotelian scholasticism as an idolatry that concedes far too much ontological density to the creature. Moreover, Gilson maintained that it was the Aristotelian notion of nature as sufficient unto itself that allowed Aquinas to distinguish with unequaled precision \xE2\x80\x9Cthe respective domains of the supernatural and the natural, and of theology and philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 114). Malebranche's occasionalism, with its attendant denial of the reality and efficacy of secondary causes, is the antithesis of St. Thomas's created world which is robustly and intrinsically causal. Malebranche's occasionalism indicates that a philosophy's Christian inspiration is no guarantee of its being a sound philosophy. In Gilson's synthetic view of the history of philosophy, bad ideas, which like all ideas capture intelligible universals, connect in a constellation of essential relations and have their own impersonal consequences that devolve independently of their original context and their author's intentions. In his two doctoral theses, brilliantly defended in 1926 before an admiring audience of eminent academics, Gouhier took account of Gilson's notion of Christian philosophy and the Augustinianism of Malebranche; he located the center of Malebranche's philosophy in our union with a God whose power and glory must be exalted in preference to the putative autonomy of the creature. Yet, Gouhier sustained a phenomenological, rather than a conceptual or systematizing, approach that tries to remain internal to the thought which it describes: accordingly, Malebranche's philosophical vision arises from and articulates a world of Christian experience to be lived and understood only from within itself. Thus Gouhier's historical method permits the historian, who would remain really in contact with Malebranche's own world, no access to an external reference point from which to criticize it. Evidently, this is not how Gilson practiced \xE2\x80\x9Cthe\xE2\x80\x9D historical method. Forty years later, in a letter to Gouhier (9 June 1966), Gilson refers disapprovingly to Gouhier's \xE2\x80\x9Cradical historical contingentism\xE2\x80\x9D, which ignores the metaphysical necessities inherent in philosophical thinking. History, as narrative, does bear on the individual and the contingent particular but philosophy, as science, bears on the universal and the essential. The philosophical historian can link the thoughts of philosophers, if they derive from a common principle, and thereby reveal the inevitability of those conceptual chains. With remarkable \xC3\xA9clat, Gilson himself did just that in <i>The Unity of Philosophical Experience</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>As one might expect from disciples moving still in the ambit of their master, almost every article in this book rehearses rather than criticizes or deconstructs Gilson's historical and philosophical views. It is not surprising, then, that (Dennehy excepted) Maritain remains for most of them, as he was for Gilson, the great <i>alternative</i> Thomist. So, Richard Geraghty does again what he did in his published doctoral thesis; he takes issue with Maritain's notion of moral philosophy (influenced by John of St. Thomas) as \xE2\x80\x9Ca speculatively practical science\xE2\x80\x9D needing to be supplemented by a \xE2\x80\x9Cpractically practical science\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 15). Geraghty convincingly argues that Aquinas's distinction of the speculative and practical sciences is disjunctive; it eliminates the middle ground on which Maritain seeks to position ethics. The goal of ethics as a practical science is determining, choosing, and effecting the right deed to be done. Aristotelian ethics in making that practical determination draws on but does not get bogged down in metaphysics; rather, it takes as its own proper starting point (<i>NE</i>, I, 4, 1095b16-22) \xE2\x80\x9Cthe well-habituated person as the highest standard of his culture\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 16). Such a man will already know that honor is better than pleasure, and virtue better than honor. He needs only to be instructed through the theoretical demonstrations of the moral philosopher that the intellectual virtue of contemplation is the highest component of happiness. More controversial and less convincing are Geraghty's brief remarks (pp. 26-27) on how Aquinas the \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral theologian\xE2\x80\x9D differs from Aquinas the \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral philosopher\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94which can only mean Aquinas the commentator on Aristotle's ethics. In that capacity, Aquinas quietly attempts to shore up Aristotle's well-habituated man by insinuating into his exegesis some hint of the medieval Christian doctrine of <i>synderesis</i>, the innate knowledge of universal principles of practical reason that license quasi-immediate inferences to the inviolable moral precepts of the Decalogue. [Cf. <i>III Sent.</i>, d. 33, q. 2,a. 4, sol. 4 (Moos, 3: 1066, n. 242); <i>SLE</i>, II, 4, 1105b5, 101-6; V, 12, 1134b19, 49-57; VI, 11, 1144b1, 30-33.] Since Aquinas grounds these self-evident \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural law\xE2\x80\x9D principles \xE2\x80\x9Conto-theologically\xE2\x80\x9D (in the human mind they participate the divine law in God's mind), it is highly doubtful that Aquinas held that \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo <i>irreducible</i> ways exist to consider human actions\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9Dfrom the viewpoint of faith in the word of God and the viewpoint of the reason of the good and experienced person\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 26; italics my emphasis).</p>  \n\
  <p>As one might also suspect, there are several potent doses of <i>anti-modernisme</i> administered in this inaugural volume. James Schall warns that neither theology nor philosophy can declare \xE2\x80\x9Cits own absolute autonomy\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 178). The warning is hitched to current events: \xE2\x80\x9CCurrent worldwide political turmoil\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 179), especially as it arises from conflicts between secular and Islamic cultures, exposes (Leo Strauss notwithstanding) the impossibility of \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo [unrelated] truths,\xE2\x80\x9D that is, it exposes the need to harmonize without eliminating either reason or revelation. Gilson sought to harmonize them using the reasoning of Aquinas. Aquinas showed that philosophy cannot be identified even with \xE2\x80\x9CThe Philosopher,\xE2\x80\x9D Aristotle, and that faith is not contrary to sound philosophy, thereby freeing reason and protecting revelation: in other words, Aquinas showed that Aristotle's arguments leading to conclusions <i>contra articulos fidei</i> are non-demonstrative and that there are cogent rational proofs for the <i>praembula fidei</i>. Thus reason, without negating itself, leaves an opening wherein one\xE2\x80\x94moved by divine grace\xE2\x80\x94may rationally accept transcendent or super-rational revealed truths. In no way, then, does Gilson propose, contrary to what Murphy erroneously states, that we can only begin with \xE2\x80\x9Cthe act of blind faith in the invisible God\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 103). It is the modern rejection of Aristotle, which was undertaken as the necessary propaedeutic for modern science, that has led to a philosophical reason severely diminished by \xE2\x80\x9Crelativism and skepticism\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 180) and a correlative religious fideism. For his part, Gilson attempted to reinvigorate modern philosophical reason \xE2\x80\x9Cby restoring revelation to its proper content and role\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 182). The restorative revelation in question is\xE2\x80\x94and Schall unhesitatingly affirms that it can only be\xE2\x80\x94Christian: for Schall, the West's struggle with an ideological Islam appealing to the arbitrary (that is, non-rational) will of Allah, is, first of all, a struggle within Islam about whether its own economic and political marginalization must be attributed to untrue religious beliefs and faulty intellectual foundations.</p>  \n\
  <p>The editor of this volume, Peter Redpath, is convinced, and doubtless not he alone among its authors, that Gilson cleared the historical and doctrinal path, by exposing modern philosophy as an epistemological detour leading to an idealist cul-de-sac, back to the enduring truths of Thomistic \xE2\x80\x9Crealism.\xE2\x80\x9D Redpath celebrates the significance of Maurer's essay, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Unity of a Science: St. Thomas and the Nominalists,\xE2\x80\x9D which was written for the septicentennial celebration of St. Thomas's death. In this essay, Maurer traces Descartes's dream of a systematic science of clear and distinct ideas (so important for modern conceptions of science) to its historical antecedents in the late medieval nominalists, notably William of Ockham, who rejected Aquinas's doctrine that a science is unified in reference to its abstracted formal object. Similarly, Joseph Califano singles out for praise Maurer's lucid English translation and helpful annotation of Aquinas's <i>Commentary on the de Trinitate of Boethius</i>: the fifth and sixth question of this commentary explicitly treat the division of the three theoretical sciences (physics, mathematics, and metaphysics) by detailing the three kinds of abstraction from matter that the intellect can effect. The nominalists, after eliminating universal intelligible natures (and thus abstracted formal objects), had to find a new ground for the unity of a science. Leibniz, commenting on the seventeenth century nominalist, the philosopher Mario Nizolius, praises the medieval nominalists as \xE2\x80\x9Cmost in harmony with the spirit of modern philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (quoted Redpath, p. 31). For this very reason, however, Redpath would be forced to brand, eagerly it seems, modern philosophy as well as its late medieval antecedent \xE2\x80\x9Ca sophistry\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 34).</p>  \n\
  <p>The way back to pre-modern epistemic certitudes, however, may not be so straight as Redpath hopes, even for convinced Thomists: Raymond Dennehy, rehearses\xE2\x80\x94syncretizing their positions rather than clearly resolving\xE2\x80\x94the exact issue between Maritain and Gilson. How should an \xE2\x80\x9Cauthentic\xE2\x80\x9D Thomistic realism be grounded: immediately or critically? Everything depends on how the bugbear, \xE2\x80\x9Ccritique of knowledge,\xE2\x80\x9D is defined. The issue inflamed neo-Thomists for almost a hundred years. Dennehy, a Maritainian partisan despite his conciliatory intent, continues to think that Thomistic realism, standing before the bottomless \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemological trench\xE2\x80\x9D of modern scepticism, somehow requires and permits both an immediate and a critical grounding, thereby apparently\xE2\x80\x94or coming very close to\xE2\x80\x94conceding the need and the possibility of exactly what Gilson, ever the vigilant anti-Cartesian, never ceased to deny: a reflexive, second order, inferentially constructed bridge to the extra-mental world of naturally knowable things. This is not to deny that Thomists need a cognitive theory (explaining how we know the extra-mental world); it is to say that it should not be conflated with critique (essaying to demonstrate the <i>conclusion</i> that we do know the world). While perhaps not conflating them, Maritain\xE2\x80\x94with Dennehy in tow\xE2\x80\x94seems to think that the former is somehow a suitable and necessary stand-in for the latter. (For a vastly more developed and sustainable version of the latter position, which really does sublate the now rather faded neo-Thomist controversy, one can recommend total immersion in Lonergan.)</p>  \n\
  <p>In any case, Gilson surely would never have agreed\xE2\x80\x94however intense Maritain's Bergsonian inspired anxieties\xE2\x80\x94that his brand of \xE2\x80\x9Cdogmatic\xE2\x80\x9D realism entailed or was implicated in a dangerous \xE2\x80\x9Crelying on intuition cut free from rationality\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 78): analytically, <i>ens</i> is the first concept that falls under the intellect's act of simple apprehension, but it is the <i>judgment</i> that extra-mental \xE2\x80\x9CBeing is and non-being is not\xE2\x80\x9D that is the first cognitive certitude or <i>principle</i> of knowledge. The critical illusion, Gilson repeated incessantly, is to imagine that one can attain some greater epistemic certitude than what is actually available at the very beginning. Immediate cognitive contact with the extra-mental world is either a self-evident first principle or, as the history of modern philosophy proved to Gilson at least, a radically shaky, impossible to preserve, and, finally, utterly unreachable conclusion. To the very end, Gilson scorned Maritain's whole epistemological anxieties. In 1919, Maritain signed the apodeictic manifesto of the politically right-wing and aesthetically conservative so-called \xE2\x80\x9C<i>parti de l'intelligence.\xE2\x80\x9D</i> Fifty-five years later, one year after Maritain's death, Gilson wrote acerbically to Armand Maurer that Maritain's youthful \xE2\x80\x9Crevival of realism,\xE2\x80\x9D once so attracted to but then so intemperately denigratory of Bergson's alleged irrationalism, was not, in fact, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe party of being.\xE2\x80\x9D It is hard to imagine a greater Gilsonian \xE2\x80\x9Cput-down.\xE2\x80\x9D Francesca Murphy proposes, though I am disinclined to accept it, that it is through his own notion of \xE2\x80\x9Ca vital, fluid, and energetic act of existence [that] Gilson incorporated the Bergsonian intuition into his metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 99). On the contrary, Gilson always insisted that we attain the <i>actus essendi</i> only through judgment.</p>  \n\
  <p>The book\xE2\x80\x94I mean to say with benignity\xE2\x80\x94is an in-house laudation of Gilson: genial, almost wistful in recalling the magnificent scholar, superb teacher, and deeply Christian man. Who could deny\xE2\x80\x94and why would one want to?\xE2\x80\x94that Gilson was an \xE2\x80\x9Cintellectual giant\xE2\x80\x9D who \xE2\x80\x9Cdwarfed and intimidated many of his contemporaries\xE2\x80\x9D (xvii). No mere intellectual giant though: Gilson, in his own life and in the <i>polis</i>, was capable of applying luminous theory to opaque practice; in 1945, he served as a member of the French delegation to the conference writing the charter for the United Nations. Desmond Fitzgerald recalls the droll incident of Gilson speaking Russian to Molotov and his fellow Soviets\xE2\x80\x94slyly, and to their chagrin, only at the very end of the Conference. This profound humanist, then, was a giant in many senses.</p>  \n\
  <p>Nonetheless, Gilson's intellectual contemporaries are not our contemporaries; ours are no longer so intimidated by the deceased giant. In a published lecture (the twenty-first in \xE2\x80\x9CThe \xC3\x89tienne Gilson Series), given 3 March 2000 at the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, Marcia Colish provides some details about the \xE2\x80\x9Cnewer maps\xE2\x80\x9D of scholasticism that are being drawn, and that decenter Aquinas, who occupied the high point of the \xE2\x80\x9Cold story-line\xE2\x80\x9D of the neo-Thomists, including Gilson. But lest we too quickly assimilate Gilson to other \xE2\x80\x9Cneo-Thomists,\xE2\x80\x9D we might remind Colish that Gilson began his career not as a medievalist but studying Descartes, whose sources he traced back to the Middle Ages. Gilson backed into the Middle Ages and he always read the mediaevals with his eye on his contemporaries as well as the moderns\xE2\x80\x94some have said with an eye too fixed on Heidegger's dubious history of the forgetfulness of being. As I mentioned, Wayne Hankey, drawing on recent French scholarship, has written a series of provocative articles about the neo-Platonist sources of Aquinas's existential metaphysics that purport to show that \xE2\x80\x9CGilson's Thomism is past, being sustainable neither historically nor philosophically\xE2\x80\x9D (\xE2\x80\x9CDenys and Aquinas: Antimodern cold and postmodern hot,\xE2\x80\x9D in <i>Christian Origins: Theology, Rhetoric and Community</i> [London/New York: Routledge, 1998], 139\xE2\x80\x9384; quotation p. 147). Well, I am still confident that Gilson's astonishing historical scholarship, like those of the unsurpassably erudite nineteenth-century German classicists, will remain for a very long time a touchstone for all latter-day medievalists. But it is not, of course, the <i>ne plus ultra</i>. Hankey's provocative judgments do call for some considered response from Gilsonians, who tend to spend too much time rehearsing the jejune neo-Thomist debates of the last century. Doubtless Gilson, if he were still with us, would respond to Hadot and Hankey and to many others: his continuous engagement with contemporary intellectual life is what made him more than just a \xE2\x80\x9Chistorian.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \n\
  <p>As for Gilson's own philosophical views, they will have as much vitality and pertinence as the Gilsonians who espouse them. Anton Pegis, another one of Gilson's illustrious students and colleagues, continually urged his fellow Thomists not merely to repeat but to use Aquinas's principles in their own, personally constructed dialogue with contemporary philosophers. Nothing less should be asked of present-day and future Gilsonians, if there be such. To his credit, James Maroosis, in the present volume, makes valiant if somewhat convoluted efforts to find Pierce, Jean Poinsot (John of St. Thomas), and Anton Pegis concurring on the structure of cognitive intentionality: on Maroosis's reading, all affirm that knowledge is the presence of the mind-independent <i>other</i> but known as <i>other</i> solely within the knower\xE2\x80\x94a paradoxical relationship of sign to signified that is trans-subjective or external world-dependent but which allows the world to be interiorly manifested and objectified only within the knower.</p>  \n\
  <p>Nonetheless, a certain pained desire for <i>le beau temps perdu</i> suffuses the present book. Dare one attribute\xE2\x80\x94yet one more time\xE2\x80\x94 this nostalgia to the vicissitudes of Catholic intellectual and cultural life since the Second Vatican Council? No matter: non-Gilsonian \xE2\x80\x9Cexterns,\xE2\x80\x9D who as students had intellectually powerful but not quite world-making <i>ma\xC3\xAEtres</i> and who as academics wear differently calibrated spectacles when looking at and evaluating modern philosophical projects, will doubtless feel less nostalgic and, likely, less convinced that the way forward is the way backward. Yet, it would be a mistake, whether one wants to go backwards or forwards, to ignore Gilson. Undoubtedly, he would have rejected so simple-minded a dichotomy and given historically and philosophically overriding reasons to do so. If for that reason alone, one can happily welcome this inaugural issue of the promised Gilson series. </p>"

  <p>Given the terms of the book's dedication, the first question to ask is: What is the \xE2\x80\x9CGilsonian method\xE2\x80\x9D? Robert Delfino's article summarizes Maurer's 1983 book, <i>About Beauty: A Thomistic Interpretation</i>. But this book is perhaps not the best instance of Maurer applying the \xE2\x80\x9CGilsonian method\xE2\x80\x9D of historical scholarship; in it, Maurer attempts a metaphysical synthesis and Thomistic prolongation rather than the uncovering and interpretation of the historical sources of Aquinas's scattered remarks about beauty: beauty is a transcendental property of being, differing from being only in notion; it is a pleasing intellectual vision of the <i>claritas, consonantia, integritas</i> \xE2\x80\x9Cradiating\xE2\x80\x9D from a thing's form (cf. <i>ST,</i> I, q. 5, a. 4, ad 1).  In <i>The Arts of the Beautiful</i>, Gilson, using a neologism incorporating the Greek term <i>kalos</i> (beauty), called this kind of metaphysics of transcendental beauty a \xE2\x80\x9Ccalology,\xE2\x80\x9D which he then carefully distinguished both from \xE2\x80\x9Caesthetics,\xE2\x80\x9D the theory of how artistic beauty is perceived, and the \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy of art,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cthe theory of how works of art are made.\xE2\x80\x9D The distinctions were controversial. Gilson and Maritain, although presumably they agreed about the metaphysical elements of Aquinas's \xE2\x80\x9Ccalology,\xE2\x80\x9D had lengthy, disputatious, and rather personally embittered exchanges, so Francesca Murphy recounts, about the possibility and manner of distinguishing the other two philosophical theories about art.</p>  \n\
  <p>Jorge Gracia, who himself has written astutely about the variant philosophical uses of the history of philosophy, irenically labels Gilson's historical method \xE2\x80\x9Cthe enlightening gloss.\xE2\x80\x9D According to Gracia, Gilson's primary purpose was to understand the text of an historical author by understanding the \xE2\x80\x9Ccontroversies, issues and views common when it was produced\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 2). Typically, Gilson glosses his focal texts by (1) using a battery of philosophical concepts\xE2\x80\x94that are not always sufficiently explained, so Gracia judges\xE2\x80\x94to interpret them; (2) having his own explicit philosophical criterion by which to evaluate them; (3) simplifying or reducing textual and conceptual complexities to the main philosophical issue raised in the focal text(s). In short, Gilson's enlightening gloss is \xE2\x80\x9Can explanatory paraphrase\xE2\x80\x9D of the sort that so-called contemporary \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic Thomists,\xE2\x80\x9D who are fond of minute logical reconstructions of Aquinas's arguments, largely eschew. Gracia contends, correctly, that Gilson narrated the history of philosophy as one long <i>praeparatio</i> for and one long <i>declinatio</i> from Aquinas: in particular, from Aquinas's \xE2\x80\x9Cexistentialism\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94linguistically marked by the Latin infinitive of the verb \xE2\x80\x9Cto be\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94the metaphysics of <i>esse</i>.  Gilson famously opined that Aquinas, inspired by what the saint himself called (<i>SCG,</i> I, c. 22; Pera, 2: 33a, n. 211) \xE2\x80\x9Cthe sublime truth\xE2\x80\x9D that God revealed to Moses, recorded in Exodus, 3.13 (<i>\xE2\x80\x9CEgo sum qui sum,</i>\xE2\x80\x9D in the Latin translation familiar to Aquinas), came to a historically unique understanding of the divine name that, Gilson held, was the keystone of Thomistic metaphysics: the divine essence is identical with <i>ipsum esse subsistens</i>, and that the finite <i>actus essendi</i> which participates the divine <i>esse</i> is the foundational actuality of all created natures.</p>  \n\
  <p>Gracia does not mention, however, that Gilson's narrative alleging the revealed source and the historical uniqueness of the Thomistic metaphysical insight has been plausibly challenged by Hadot and other scholars, who trace the Thomistic <i>ipsum esse subsistens</i> doctrine through the medieval neo-Platonist tradition\xE2\x80\x94mediated to Aquinas by Pseudo-Dionysius, Boethius, and Proclus\xE2\x80\x94back to an anonymous commentary (probably by Porphyry) on Plato's <i>Parmenides</i>. For the anonymous commentator, the first principle is not, in typical neo-Platonist fashion, \xE2\x80\x9Cbeyond being\xE2\x80\x9D but is pure activity (<i>auto to en\xC3\xA9rgein</i>) whose nature is designated by the infinitive <i>auto to e\xC3\xAEnai</i>. Hadot's alternative account raises many questions, which have been put in the form of a direct challenge by Wayne Hankey, about the soundness of Gilson's historical views. If Hadot and Hankey are correct, Gilson was wrong about the historical uniqueness and biblical source of Aquinas's <i>esse</i> metaphysics.</p>  \n\
  <p>So too, questions about how historical method should be used and what it reveals in philosophy\xE2\x80\x94Is the history of philosophy focused on the chains of essentially or necessarily connected ideas or on contingent and self-contained, radically personalized insights?\xE2\x80\x94underlie the rather spun-out but worthwhile article that Richard Fafara devotes to the relationship between Gilson and his doctoral student Henri Gouhier (1898-1994). Gouhier's student thesis (<i>La pens\xC3\xA9e religieuse de Descartes</i>), the product of a seminar with Gilson, was published and awarded a prize by the <i>Academie fran\xC3\xA7aise</i> in 1924. In his thesis, Gouhier rejected any temporally fixed or abstractly global portrait of Descartes's thought; instead, he presented Cartesian philosophy biographically as a succession of recastings which reinvented for diverse audiences Descartes's earliest themes. Gilson, while remaining unconvinced by some of Gouhier's particular claims (especially Descartes's alleged affinities with Thomism rather than, as scholarly convention held, the Augustinianism of the seventeenth century French Oratory), nonetheless, praised his student's method as Aristotelian as well as properly historical: Gouhier's interpretative focus, biographical rather than systematic, moves from Descartes's concrete actions to cautious speculations about Descartes's (for Gilson irretrievably) hidden motives. Though Gouhier became a life-long friend and eminent colleague, the erstwhile student never agreed with his former ma\xC3\xAEtre about the nature and end of historical method. Their disagreements conspicuously surfaced in their respective interpretations of Malebranche.</p>  \n\
  <p>For Gilson, Malebranche was not just, in some vague sense, a \xE2\x80\x9Creligious philosopher\xE2\x80\x9D but an Augustinian, who, like his thirteenth century predecessors (especially Bonaventure), regarded Aristotle as pagan and Aristotelian scholasticism as an idolatry that concedes far too much ontological density to the creature. Moreover, Gilson maintained that it was the Aristotelian notion of nature as sufficient unto itself that allowed Aquinas to distinguish with unequaled precision \xE2\x80\x9Cthe respective domains of the supernatural and the natural, and of theology and philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 114). Malebranche's occasionalism, with its attendant denial of the reality and efficacy of secondary causes, is the antithesis of St. Thomas's created world which is robustly and intrinsically causal. Malebranche's occasionalism indicates that a philosophy's Christian inspiration is no guarantee of its being a sound philosophy. In Gilson's synthetic view of the history of philosophy, bad ideas, which like all ideas capture intelligible universals, connect in a constellation of essential relations and have their own impersonal consequences that devolve independently of their original context and their author's intentions. In his two doctoral theses, brilliantly defended in 1926 before an admiring audience of eminent academics, Gouhier took account of Gilson's notion of Christian philosophy and the Augustinianism of Malebranche; he located the center of Malebranche's philosophy in our union with a God whose power and glory must be exalted in preference to the putative autonomy of the creature. Yet, Gouhier sustained a phenomenological, rather than a conceptual or systematizing, approach that tries to remain internal to the thought which it describes: accordingly, Malebranche's philosophical vision arises from and articulates a world of Christian experience to be lived and understood only from within itself. Thus Gouhier's historical method permits the historian, who would remain really in contact with Malebranche's own world, no access to an external reference point from which to criticize it. Evidently, this is not how Gilson practiced \xE2\x80\x9Cthe\xE2\x80\x9D historical method. Forty years later, in a letter to Gouhier (9 June 1966), Gilson refers disapprovingly to Gouhier's \xE2\x80\x9Cradical historical contingentism\xE2\x80\x9D, which ignores the metaphysical necessities inherent in philosophical thinking. History, as narrative, does bear on the individual and the contingent particular but philosophy, as science, bears on the universal and the essential. The philosophical historian can link the thoughts of philosophers, if they derive from a common principle, and thereby reveal the inevitability of those conceptual chains. With remarkable \xC3\xA9clat, Gilson himself did just that in <i>The Unity of Philosophical Experience</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>As one might expect from disciples moving still in the ambit of their master, almost every article in this book rehearses rather than criticizes or deconstructs Gilson's historical and philosophical views. It is not surprising, then, that (Dennehy excepted) Maritain remains for most of them, as he was for Gilson, the great <i>alternative</i> Thomist. So, Richard Geraghty does again what he did in his published doctoral thesis; he takes issue with Maritain's notion of moral philosophy (influenced by John of St. Thomas) as \xE2\x80\x9Ca speculatively practical science\xE2\x80\x9D needing to be supplemented by a \xE2\x80\x9Cpractically practical science\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 15). Geraghty convincingly argues that Aquinas's distinction of the speculative and practical sciences is disjunctive; it eliminates the middle ground on which Maritain seeks to position ethics. The goal of ethics as a practical science is determining, choosing, and effecting the right deed to be done. Aristotelian ethics in making that practical determination draws on but does not get bogged down in metaphysics; rather, it takes as its own proper starting point (<i>NE</i>, I, 4, 1095b16-22) \xE2\x80\x9Cthe well-habituated person as the highest standard of his culture\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 16). Such a man will already know that honor is better than pleasure, and virtue better than honor. He needs only to be instructed through the theoretical demonstrations of the moral philosopher that the intellectual virtue of contemplation is the highest component of happiness. More controversial and less convincing are Geraghty's brief remarks (pp. 26-27) on how Aquinas the \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral theologian\xE2\x80\x9D differs from Aquinas the \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral philosopher\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94which can only mean Aquinas the commentator on Aristotle's ethics. In that capacity, Aquinas quietly attempts to shore up Aristotle's well-habituated man by insinuating into his exegesis some hint of the medieval Christian doctrine of <i>synderesis</i>, the innate knowledge of universal principles of practical reason that license quasi-immediate inferences to the inviolable moral precepts of the Decalogue. [Cf. <i>III Sent.</i>, d. 33, q. 2,a. 4, sol. 4 (Moos, 3: 1066, n. 242); <i>SLE</i>, II, 4, 1105b5, 101-6; V, 12, 1134b19, 49-57; VI, 11, 1144b1, 30-33.] Since Aquinas grounds these self-evident \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural law\xE2\x80\x9D principles \xE2\x80\x9Conto-theologically\xE2\x80\x9D (in the human mind they participate the divine law in God's mind), it is highly doubtful that Aquinas held that \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo <i>irreducible</i> ways exist to consider human actions\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9Dfrom the viewpoint of faith in the word of God and the viewpoint of the reason of the good and experienced person\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 26; italics my emphasis).</p>  \n\
  <p>As one might also suspect, there are several potent doses of <i>anti-modernisme</i> administered in this inaugural volume. James Schall warns that neither theology nor philosophy can declare \xE2\x80\x9Cits own absolute autonomy\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 178). The warning is hitched to current events: \xE2\x80\x9CCurrent worldwide political turmoil\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 179), especially as it arises from conflicts between secular and Islamic cultures, exposes (Leo Strauss notwithstanding) the impossibility of \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo [unrelated] truths,\xE2\x80\x9D that is, it exposes the need to harmonize without eliminating either reason or revelation. Gilson sought to harmonize them using the reasoning of Aquinas. Aquinas showed that philosophy cannot be identified even with \xE2\x80\x9CThe Philosopher,\xE2\x80\x9D Aristotle, and that faith is not contrary to sound philosophy, thereby freeing reason and protecting revelation: in other words, Aquinas showed that Aristotle's arguments leading to conclusions <i>contra articulos fidei</i> are non-demonstrative and that there are cogent rational proofs for the <i>praembula fidei</i>. Thus reason, without negating itself, leaves an opening wherein one\xE2\x80\x94moved by divine grace\xE2\x80\x94may rationally accept transcendent or super-rational revealed truths. In no way, then, does Gilson propose, contrary to what Murphy erroneously states, that we can only begin with \xE2\x80\x9Cthe act of blind faith in the invisible God\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 103). It is the modern rejection of Aristotle, which was undertaken as the necessary propaedeutic for modern science, that has led to a philosophical reason severely diminished by \xE2\x80\x9Crelativism and skepticism\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 180) and a correlative religious fideism. For his part, Gilson attempted to reinvigorate modern philosophical reason \xE2\x80\x9Cby restoring revelation to its proper content and role\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 182). The restorative revelation in question is\xE2\x80\x94and Schall unhesitatingly affirms that it can only be\xE2\x80\x94Christian: for Schall, the West's struggle with an ideological Islam appealing to the arbitrary (that is, non-rational) will of Allah, is, first of all, a struggle within Islam about whether its own economic and political marginalization must be attributed to untrue religious beliefs and faulty intellectual foundations.</p>  \n\
  <p>The editor of this volume, Peter Redpath, is convinced, and doubtless not he alone among its authors, that Gilson cleared the historical and doctrinal path, by exposing modern philosophy as an epistemological detour leading to an idealist cul-de-sac, back to the enduring truths of Thomistic \xE2\x80\x9Crealism.\xE2\x80\x9D Redpath celebrates the significance of Maurer's essay, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Unity of a Science: St. Thomas and the Nominalists,\xE2\x80\x9D which was written for the septicentennial celebration of St. Thomas's death. In this essay, Maurer traces Descartes's dream of a systematic science of clear and distinct ideas (so important for modern conceptions of science) to its historical antecedents in the late medieval nominalists, notably William of Ockham, who rejected Aquinas's doctrine that a science is unified in reference to its abstracted formal object. Similarly, Joseph Califano singles out for praise Maurer's lucid English translation and helpful annotation of Aquinas's <i>Commentary on the de Trinitate of Boethius</i>: the fifth and sixth question of this commentary explicitly treat the division of the three theoretical sciences (physics, mathematics, and metaphysics) by detailing the three kinds of abstraction from matter that the intellect can effect. The nominalists, after eliminating universal intelligible natures (and thus abstracted formal objects), had to find a new ground for the unity of a science. Leibniz, commenting on the seventeenth century nominalist, the philosopher Mario Nizolius, praises the medieval nominalists as \xE2\x80\x9Cmost in harmony with the spirit of modern philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (quoted Redpath, p. 31). For this very reason, however, Redpath would be forced to brand, eagerly it seems, modern philosophy as well as its late medieval antecedent \xE2\x80\x9Ca sophistry\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 34).</p>  \n\
  <p>The way back to pre-modern epistemic certitudes, however, may not be so straight as Redpath hopes, even for convinced Thomists: Raymond Dennehy, rehearses\xE2\x80\x94syncretizing their positions rather than clearly resolving\xE2\x80\x94the exact issue between Maritain and Gilson. How should an \xE2\x80\x9Cauthentic\xE2\x80\x9D Thomistic realism be grounded: immediately or critically? Everything depends on how the bugbear, \xE2\x80\x9Ccritique of knowledge,\xE2\x80\x9D is defined. The issue inflamed neo-Thomists for almost a hundred years. Dennehy, a Maritainian partisan despite his conciliatory intent, continues to think that Thomistic realism, standing before the bottomless \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemological trench\xE2\x80\x9D of modern scepticism, somehow requires and permits both an immediate and a critical grounding, thereby apparently\xE2\x80\x94or coming very close to\xE2\x80\x94conceding the need and the possibility of exactly what Gilson, ever the vigilant anti-Cartesian, never ceased to deny: a reflexive, second order, inferentially constructed bridge to the extra-mental world of naturally knowable things. This is not to deny that Thomists need a cognitive theory (explaining how we know the extra-mental world); it is to say that it should not be conflated with critique (essaying to demonstrate the <i>conclusion</i> that we do know the world). While perhaps not conflating them, Maritain\xE2\x80\x94with Dennehy in tow\xE2\x80\x94seems to think that the former is somehow a suitable and necessary stand-in for the latter. (For a vastly more developed and sustainable version of the latter position, which really does sublate the now rather faded neo-Thomist controversy, one can recommend total immersion in Lonergan.)</p>  \n\
  <p>In any case, Gilson surely would never have agreed\xE2\x80\x94however intense Maritain's Bergsonian inspired anxieties\xE2\x80\x94that his brand of \xE2\x80\x9Cdogmatic\xE2\x80\x9D realism entailed or was implicated in a dangerous \xE2\x80\x9Crelying on intuition cut free from rationality\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 78): analytically, <i>ens</i> is the first concept that falls under the intellect's act of simple apprehension, but it is the <i>judgment</i> that extra-mental \xE2\x80\x9CBeing is and non-being is not\xE2\x80\x9D that is the first cognitive certitude or <i>principle</i> of knowledge. The critical illusion, Gilson repeated incessantly, is to imagine that one can attain some greater epistemic certitude than what is actually available at the very beginning. Immediate cognitive contact with the extra-mental world is either a self-evident first principle or, as the history of modern philosophy proved to Gilson at least, a radically shaky, impossible to preserve, and, finally, utterly unreachable conclusion. To the very end, Gilson scorned Maritain's whole epistemological anxieties. In 1919, Maritain signed the apodeictic manifesto of the politically right-wing and aesthetically conservative so-called \xE2\x80\x9C<i>parti de l'intelligence.\xE2\x80\x9D</i> Fifty-five years later, one year after Maritain's death, Gilson wrote acerbically to Armand Maurer that Maritain's youthful \xE2\x80\x9Crevival of realism,\xE2\x80\x9D once so attracted to but then so intemperately denigratory of Bergson's alleged irrationalism, was not, in fact, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe party of being.\xE2\x80\x9D It is hard to imagine a greater Gilsonian \xE2\x80\x9Cput-down.\xE2\x80\x9D Francesca Murphy proposes, though I am disinclined to accept it, that it is through his own notion of \xE2\x80\x9Ca vital, fluid, and energetic act of existence [that] Gilson incorporated the Bergsonian intuition into his metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 99). On the contrary, Gilson always insisted that we attain the <i>actus essendi</i> only through judgment.</p>  \n\
  <p>The book\xE2\x80\x94I mean to say with benignity\xE2\x80\x94is an in-house laudation of Gilson: genial, almost wistful in recalling the magnificent scholar, superb teacher, and deeply Christian man. Who could deny\xE2\x80\x94and why would one want to?\xE2\x80\x94that Gilson was an \xE2\x80\x9Cintellectual giant\xE2\x80\x9D who \xE2\x80\x9Cdwarfed and intimidated many of his contemporaries\xE2\x80\x9D (xvii). No mere intellectual giant though: Gilson, in his own life and in the <i>polis</i>, was capable of applying luminous theory to opaque practice; in 1945, he served as a member of the French delegation to the conference writing the charter for the United Nations. Desmond Fitzgerald recalls the droll incident of Gilson speaking Russian to Molotov and his fellow Soviets\xE2\x80\x94slyly, and to their chagrin, only at the very end of the Conference. This profound humanist, then, was a giant in many senses.</p>  \n\
  <p>Nonetheless, Gilson's intellectual contemporaries are not our contemporaries; ours are no longer so intimidated by the deceased giant. In a published lecture (the twenty-first in \xE2\x80\x9CThe \xC3\x89tienne Gilson Series), given 3 March 2000 at the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, Marcia Colish provides some details about the \xE2\x80\x9Cnewer maps\xE2\x80\x9D of scholasticism that are being drawn, and that decenter Aquinas, who occupied the high point of the \xE2\x80\x9Cold story-line\xE2\x80\x9D of the neo-Thomists, including Gilson. But lest we too quickly assimilate Gilson to other \xE2\x80\x9Cneo-Thomists,\xE2\x80\x9D we might remind Colish that Gilson began his career not as a medievalist but studying Descartes, whose sources he traced back to the Middle Ages. Gilson backed into the Middle Ages and he always read the mediaevals with his eye on his contemporaries as well as the moderns\xE2\x80\x94some have said with an eye too fixed on Heidegger's dubious history of the forgetfulness of being. As I mentioned, Wayne Hankey, drawing on recent French scholarship, has written a series of provocative articles about the neo-Platonist sources of Aquinas's existential metaphysics that purport to show that \xE2\x80\x9CGilson's Thomism is past, being sustainable neither historically nor philosophically\xE2\x80\x9D (\xE2\x80\x9CDenys and Aquinas: Antimodern cold and postmodern hot,\xE2\x80\x9D in <i>Christian Origins: Theology, Rhetoric and Community</i> [London/New York: Routledge, 1998], 139\xE2\x80\x9384; quotation p. 147). Well, I am still confident that Gilson's astonishing historical scholarship, like those of the unsurpassably erudite nineteenth-century German classicists, will remain for a very long time a touchstone for all latter-day medievalists. But it is not, of course, the <i>ne plus ultra</i>. Hankey's provocative judgments do call for some considered response from Gilsonians, who tend to spend too much time rehearsing the jejune neo-Thomist debates of the last century. Doubtless Gilson, if he were still with us, would respond to Hadot and Hankey and to many others: his continuous engagement with contemporary intellectual life is what made him more than just a \xE2\x80\x9Chistorian.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \n\
  <p>As for Gilson's own philosophical views, they will have as much vitality and pertinence as the Gilsonians who espouse them. Anton Pegis, another one of Gilson's illustrious students and colleagues, continually urged his fellow Thomists not merely to repeat but to use Aquinas's principles in their own, personally constructed dialogue with contemporary philosophers. Nothing less should be asked of present-day and future Gilsonians, if there be such. To his credit, James Maroosis, in the present volume, makes valiant if somewhat convoluted efforts to find Pierce, Jean Poinsot (John of St. Thomas), and Anton Pegis concurring on the structure of cognitive intentionality: on Maroosis's reading, all affirm that knowledge is the presence of the mind-independent <i>other</i> but known as <i>other</i> solely within the knower\xE2\x80\x94a paradoxical relationship of sign to signified that is trans-subjective or external world-dependent but which allows the world to be interiorly manifested and objectified only within the knower.</p>  \n\
  <p>Nonetheless, a certain pained desire for <i>le beau temps perdu</i> suffuses the present book. Dare one attribute\xE2\x80\x94yet one more time\xE2\x80\x94 this nostalgia to the vicissitudes of Catholic intellectual and cultural life since the Second Vatican Council? No matter: non-Gilsonian \xE2\x80\x9Cexterns,\xE2\x80\x9D who as students had intellectually powerful but not quite world-making <i>ma\xC3\xAEtres</i> and who as academics wear differently calibrated spectacles when looking at and evaluating modern philosophical projects, will doubtless feel less nostalgic and, likely, less convinced that the way forward is the way backward. Yet, it would be a mistake, whether one wants to go backwards or forwards, to ignore Gilson. Undoubtedly, he would have rejected so simple-minded a dichotomy and given historically and philosophically overriding reasons to do so. If for that reason alone, one can happily welcome this inaugural issue of the promised Gilson series. </p>"
