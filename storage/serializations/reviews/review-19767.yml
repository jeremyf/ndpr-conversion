content: "\xE2\x80\x80<p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">McLeod-Harrison articulates a  surprising view that combines cognitive <span class=\"SpellE\">irrealism</span>,  ontological pluralism, and aspects of orthodox Christian doctrine. The ontological pluralism he  defends (to be distinguished from the view in <span class=\"SpellE\">metaontology</span>) is indebted to Nelson Goodman's view that human <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> feats shape the actual World in plural, incompatible ways. One might  expect this position to be attended by some of the usual suspects: <span class=\"SpellE\">nominalism</span> about properties, a deflationary theory of truth, <span class=\"SpellE\">extensionalism</span> about possible worlds, and the concept of \"God\" as at best a <span class=\"SpellE\">Feuerbachian</span> projection or cultural make-belief.  But that's not what we get. Following Michael Lynch, McLeod-Harrison endorses a  realist account of truth. His version of pluralism relies on Platonism about  properties (especially those of truth and existence) combined with modal <span class=\"SpellE\">actualism</span> (ersatz modal realism) about possible  worlds. Most startling perhaps is the theological motivation for this position.  Evoking the naming of animals in the Garden of Eden, McLeod-Harrison argues that  humans carve new worlds because God endows them with creative powers analogous  to or continuous with his. Even though God's core does not depend on <i style=\"\">human</i> conceptual reaching, still \"God is embedded in God's conceptual scheme(s) and therefore does not  escape <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> dependence\" (5).</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The book is divided into four  main sections. The first section introduces, among other things, two seminal  sets of distinctions, <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> realism/<span class=\"SpellE\">irrealism</span> on the one hand, and <span class=\"SpellE\">alethic</span> realism/<span class=\"SpellE\">irrealism</span> on the other. A <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span>  <span class=\"SpellE\">irrealist</span> holds, while the <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> realist denies, that human <span class=\"SpellE\">cognizings</span> (conceptualizing, believing, knowing, emoting, gesticulating etc.)  contribute causally to the ways the World is. An <span class=\"SpellE\">alethic</span>  realist affirms, while the <span class=\"SpellE\">alethic</span> <span class=\"SpellE\">irrealist</span> denies, \"that a truth-bearer is true when things are as the truth-value bearer says they are\" (26). The ontological pluralism under  consideration combines <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> <span class=\"SpellE\">irrealism</span> with <span class=\"SpellE\">alethic</span> realism. Humans cannot create <i style=\"\">ex nihilo</i>; rather, through their cognitive feats they carve worlds out of \"the <span class=\"SpellE\">noumenal</span> material\" of a mind-independent World created and sustained by the <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> activity of God (31).</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">A main focus in section two  is to flesh out a compelling response to the consistency dilemma. This is the  challenge. If pluralism is right, two distinct metaphysical perspectives <span class=\"GramE\">could</span> provide equally true yet mutually incompatible descriptions of reality.  To avoid embracing contradictions, the pluralist <span class=\"SpellE\">relativizes</span> the two descriptions to different conceptual frameworks. Suitably <span class=\"SpellE\">relativized</span> to conceptual schemes, these  perspectives can be lined up side by side without contradiction. But now, all true  descriptions either describe the same absolute aspects of the World in different  languages, or they pick out different aspects of the world such that the  conjunction of perspectives yields an absolute account of the World. Either way, there  is no reason to deny that there is only one way the World is. So, pluralism  seems unmotivated.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The strategy for responding  here is heavily indebted to Michael Lynch. The core insight is that the  pluralist must draw a distinction between thin and thick metaphysical concepts (truth, existence, object, etc.). For instance, a thin or minimal concept of  object is shared across conceptual schemes, but then is filled out, enriched, or thickened differently in different worlds (Aristotle fills in the  concept of an object as a discrete entity, whereas Whitehead fills it in as a  momentary event). More generally, descriptions containing metaphysically thickened concepts could wind up mutually incompatible relative to each conceptual scheme, while also overlapping in light of their shared minimal  contents. Following Lynch, McLeod-Harrison argues that commitment to the minimal  concept of truth requires accepting truth as a thinly realistic property. But  unlike Lynch, he extends this to the concept of existence:</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Were  existence a thin property and hence fluid enough to be filled out robustly in  different worlds, pluralism would still work. After all, if truth is a property  and can be thinly taken in general but thickly filled out in different worlds, I  don't see why existence can't be just as well. <span class=\"GramE\">And if  existence, then surely objects also.</span> (105)</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The pluralist <span class=\"SpellE\">irrealist</span> seems happy to embrace Platonic realism about properties, if these  properties are general or thin enough. But the <span class=\"SpellE\">irrealist</span>  also insists that humans creatively crystallize or thicken these concepts,  creating through their <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> work different  world-versions.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The third part motivates and  provides a substantial positive explication of a Kantian inspired pluralistic <span class=\"SpellE\">irrealism</span>. I take the following to be the main  claims of this section: (1) Pluralism is motivated by the intractability of  metaphysical debates, and this in turn is due to the nature of the metaphysical  concepts themselves. (2) Epistemic commitments are explained by the ways we have  already conceptualized the world and not the other way around. (3) Our  experience of the world is already conceptually shaped. (4) But our concepts are  worldly shaped as well, for the contents of our beliefs are just chunks of the  world. (5) Our paradigmatic <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> engagement with  the worlds is not <i style=\"\">representation</i> but <i style=\"\">presentation</i>:  we <i style=\"\">aim </i>to rightly render the worlds not only <span class=\"SpellE\">alethically</span>, but also aesthetically and morally. (6) God fixes the limits and  coherence for what counts as rightly rendered worlds.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">This is a rich but also  challenging account. I will only comment on a couple of its features. Support for  claim (3) rests on John McDowell's view that our passive, empirical concepts are  always embedded in a large network of reasons. As such, the work of free  spontaneous thinking is always involved in shaping our perceptions. Furthermore, on McDowell's view, the complex sets of conceptual lenses that codify our experiences of the world are themselves historical, shaped by the free  activity of the human mind. McLeod-Harrison charges that the complex capacity for  <span class=\"GramE\">meaning-making</span> must be explained ultimately  by God, or else the <span class=\"SpellE\">irrealist</span> position collapses into an  untenable idealism. If the World depends crucially on <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> contributions, then if there were no humans, we would have no World. But  I don't think this has to show, as McLeod-Harrison claims<span class=\"GramE\">, that</span> \"Any <span class=\"SpellE\"><i style=\"\">Bildung</i></span> we have is rooted, ultimately, in God's creative activity\" (153).</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">To be fair, McLeod-Harrison  considers the possibility that the capacity for <span class=\"GramE\">meaning-making</span> has evolved, or as he puts it, that we \"have simply moved from bald  nature (bits of organic matter) to thoughtful, reasonable humans with a <span class=\"SpellE\"><i style=\"\">Bildung</i></span>\" (217). This possibility, however, is dismissed in a rather facile  fashion. He claims that our \"cultural education and history started somewhere and  that . . . remains the central mystery of philosophy to which theology -- and  for my money, particularly Christian theology -- provides a most cogent answer\" (217). A more robust strategy here is to give an argument to the best explanation. For on the one hand, the evolutionary hypothesis appears to  be at least as simple, coherent, fruitful and empirically adequate as the  theistic explanation. If these aren't helpful criteria, then at least we need motivations and specifications for other criteria that do the trick. On  the other hand, grounding human capacity for <span class=\"GramE\">meaning-making</span> in God appears equally mysterious. To some it seems nothing short of  puzzling that a self-sufficient, resplendent, infinite triune being should create  finite beings that have the ability to create. So, it seems, we need reasons to  prefer one mystery to another.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">This sort of objection  generalizes to other parts of McLeod-Harrison's argument. For instance in support of  (6) above he claims that the law of non-contradiction has to hold in all  conceptual worlds in order to provide coherence and unification for human <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> exertions in each world. The law of  non-contradiction could not be a fact in a <span class=\"SpellE\">superworld</span>, on pain  of an infinite regress. So, God's own being grounds the law of  non-contradiction, and more generally affords the unification needed across worlds. Yet it  seems that the universality desired for unification would also obtain on the  hypothesis that the law of non-contradiction is a constitutive feature of our  psychology. Furthermore, reasons are needed to show that the Trinitarian God's  specific way of grounding the law is not any more perplexing than the available alternatives, be they transcendent, transcendental, or naturalistic.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">As McLeod-Harrison  recognizes, his worldly content theory of belief (4 above) will raise suspicion. As I've mentioned, his <span class=\"SpellE\">irrealism</span> implies that the  world is constituted by <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> material. So, although  the truth-maker (on the World side) and truth-bearer (on the mind side) are  so close as to be \"merging,\" he still wants to maintain the distinction. Beliefs and not propositions are the primary truth-bearers, whereas  propositions are to be understood as concrete bits of the World. So, propositions  being the content of beliefs do not represent the world. They are identical with  it, or bits of it. None of this implies that beliefs constitute the world. McLeod-Harrison draws the distinction between <i style=\"\">act-beliefs</i>  and <i style=\"\">content-beliefs</i>. To illustrate, that the snow is white just is the fact that the snow is  white: \"Snow's being white is not an abstract entity but a concrete bit of the World\" (174). To believe that the snow is white is to take a certain mental attitude toward a bit of the world. He elaborates:</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The  thinkable isn't independent of the World -- it is the World. The only thing  independent of the World is the believing (the mental action) . . . What is clearly  mental is the attitude one takes toward the World -- in this case, the  act-belief. It is only the mental that has actual content. The proposition or the  thinkable just is a bit of the world itself and cannot, as such, have content.  (174)</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Furthermore, the distinction  between generative truth and statement truth tracks the distinction between  act-belief and content-belief. When I get things right in my attitudes, my act-<span class=\"SpellE\">believings</span>, I thereby generate facts, since facts  just are true propositions. This connection is forged \"through concepts, construction of a world, experience of that world, and <span class=\"SpellE\">believings</span> that grow within a world\" (179).</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">An interesting illustration  of how <span class=\"GramE\">act-believing</span> enriches a world  involves a father who chooses to \"go along\" with his son's observation as they both watch a bar of soap floating in the bath water. \"That is a great boat,\" says the son. On McLeod-Harrison's analysis, the father's</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span class=\"GramE\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">act</span></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">-belief changed, which  changed the ontology of the world, which changed the object of belief 'that's a bar  of soap' into a false one (an empty bit of the world) and a previously  false belief 'that's a great boat' into a true one. (186)</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">But now consider an  alternative analysis of the mental act in this case, which does not require a change in  ontology and which relies on standard psychological assumptions about the interaction between adults and children. Suppose the father forms the thought \"that  is a great boat,\" but on analysis what he truly believes is: \"that is a soap which on this particular occasion functions as a boat\". Some such translation seems to me more natural, and has the upshot of not  requiring a change in ontology.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Many more questions could be  asked about McLeod-Harrison's worldly content theory of truth. Are all propositions concrete bits of the world? What about propositions about mathematics,  modality and God? Since act-beliefs are truth-bearers, can other mental attitudes  such as wishing, desiring, fearing, lusting be true or false? If yes, how so?  If not, what principled reason keeps them out, since it's clear that at  least some of these have propositions as contents?</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The fourth and last section  provides a stimulating and nonconformist account of the Christian God's involvement  with the World. I appreciate the commitment to the creeds, and the emphasis  on orthodoxy as a living thing (225). The account of God's ways of being as  the objective standard for rightness of rendering (<span class=\"SpellE\">alethic</span>, aesthetic, and moral) for the worlds is a welcome challenge to the  narrow focus on the intellectualist models of God. His articulation of the Trinity  betrays a poetic and pastoral sensitivity, the discussion of metaphorical language  about God is both sharp and profound, and his <span class=\"SpellE\">defense</span>  of a theology of history is timely.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">But the account will also  raise some eyebrows. Some will wonder just how it is<b style=\"\"> </b>that the being of the Triune God grounds all <span class=\"SpellE\">possibilia</span> and the principle of non-contradiction, if God has no beliefs (312).  It's true that McLeod-Harrison claims God must have thoughts. But how can God  provide for the coherence of all <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> worlds without  cognitive items that play the functional role of belief? Some will worry that the  account implies a radical responsiveness on God's part to the vagaries and \"stupidities\" of human choices that impinges on God's  providence. And some will worry about the doctrine of physical creation. For, if the account is right, and \"the actual world  is itself a set of God's thoughts,\" it's hard to see how we can believe literally that God created a physical body, or that he inhabited one  (274).</span></p>"

Some will wonder just how it is<b style=\"\"> </b>that the being of the Triune God grounds all <span class=\"SpellE\">possibilia</span> and the principle of non-contradiction, if God has no beliefs (312).  It's true that McLeod-Harrison claims God must have thoughts. But how can God  provide for the coherence of all <span class=\"SpellE\">noetic</span> worlds without  cognitive items that play the functional role of belief? Some will worry that the  account implies a radical responsiveness on God's part to the vagaries and \"stupidities\" of human choices that impinges on God's  providence. And some will worry about the doctrine of physical creation. For, if the account is right, and \"the actual world  is itself a set of God's thoughts,\" it's hard to see how we can believe literally that God created a physical body, or that he inhabited one  (274).</span></p>"
