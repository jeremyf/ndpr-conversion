content: "<p>It is easy to see why we find little secondary literature on Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s work as a whole. The Boethius of the commentaries seems to be an Aristotelian; the Boethius of the theological treatises seems to be a neoplatonic Christian theologian; and the Boethius of the <i>Consolation</i> seems to be a neoplatonic philosopher. How can one write a single monograph on works so diverse by so apparently protean an author? Moreover, many scholars find Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s most original work muddled, and his solid and interesting work unoriginal.</p>  \n\
  <p>If all this were correct, we could expect a book on the Boethian corpus to be a mere collection of essays and not a unified work; that some of the essays would contain little worth reading, since they would be on muddled and unoriginal texts; and moreover, that some would be of interest only to literature scholars, others only to philosophers and still others only to theologians. John Marenbon\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Boethius</i> is most decidedly not like this, and that is not just to Marenbon\xE2\x80\x99s credit of course, but to Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s as well. Marenbon\xE2\x80\x99s discussions of Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s varied works is unified by the common threads he finds connecting works in the Boethian corpus. In addition, he argues persuasively that the <i>Consolation</i> and theological treatises are truly great philosophical works.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

  <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Logical Works</span></p>   \n\
  <p>As Marenbon points out himself, there is not much that is original in Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s logical works, yet they are worth study both for their extraordinary influence on medieval thinkers before the recovery of Aristotle and for the insight they afford into the method and content of Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s truly original, great works, the <i>Opuscula sacra</i> and the <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>.  The selection from the commentaries Marenbon treats in greatest detail is the famous discussion of universals in the <i>Second Commentary on Porphyry\xE2\x80\x99s Isagoge</i>. All later mediaeval authors took this as their point of departure in treating universals, and the way Boethius characterizes the issue colors all subsequent medieval treatments. For this reason, and because Marenbon devotes more time and attention to this text than to any other in Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s logical works, and because Marenbon\xE2\x80\x99s interpretations are themselves perplexing in some respects, it is worth a closer investigation.</p>  \n\
  <p>Boethius argues that there are no universals in extramental reality (27):</p>   <ol> <li>Everything that really exists is one in number. \t</li><li>Nothing that is common to many at the same time can be one in number. \t</li><li>Genera and species are common to many at the same time. \t</li><li>Therefore, genera and species do not really exist.</li> </ol>  \n\
  <p>Since the argument is valid, and Boethius seems to take (2) and (3) as analytically true, that leaves only (1) open for criticism. But Marenbon\xE2\x80\x99s only defense of (1) is that it \xE2\x80\x9Cis a fundamental principle accepted by Boethius and many other philosophers\xE2\x80\x9D (27). However, \xE2\x80\x9Cfundamental\xE2\x80\x9D does not imply <i>inarguable</i>, and acceptance by \xE2\x80\x9Cmany\xE2\x80\x9D other philosophers gives us a reason not to dismiss it, but not necessarily to accept it. Not all philosophers accept (1) (and, most tellingly for Boethius, not all neoplatonist philosophers accept it).</p>  \n\
  <p>This argument\xE2\x80\x99s conclusion generates an epistemological worry. Since we attempt to understand reality by classifying beings under genera and species, if there are no genera or species, our attempts are all failures. We in fact know nothing, since our ideas of genera and species are simply figments. To resolve this problem, Boethius explains that the process by which we arrive at our ideas of genera and species is not falsifying, but truth preserving. However, as commentators have often noted, Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s solution is vague. Marenbon, accordingly, offers a detailed account of the solution, dividing it into three stages.</p>  \n\
  <p>In forming ideas of genera and species, we first use mathematical abstraction. By division, we see the incorporeal nature in itself without the body that nature is fixed in. Next, we use inductive abstraction. Considering the numerically many singulars in which species are, the mind collects their likeness. The resulting thought is a species. Third, Boethius adds this thought: The objects under discussion are both singular and universal; when such an object is \xE2\x80\x9Cperceived sensibly in those things in which it has being\xE2\x80\x9D (30), it is singular; when considered in thought, it is universal.</p>  \n\
  <p>This solution is supposed to dispel our epistemological worries, but it is quite vague. Is Boethius advocating realist abstractionism or constructivism? Unfortunately, Marenbon does not characterize constructivism as clearly as he might. What he says is that on a realist view, what the mind grasps are really existing objects; while on a constructivist view, the contents of one\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts do not correspond \xE2\x80\x9Cdirectly\xE2\x80\x9D (28) or \xE2\x80\x9Cstraightforwardly\xE2\x80\x9D (30) to any one thing. What this means, I take it, is that if the relation between the object of thought and one\xE2\x80\x99s thought contents falls short of formal identity, this implies constructivism. If this is right, then if one\xE2\x80\x99s thought contents have different properties from the properties of the object one is grasping, or if one\xE2\x80\x99s thought contents are not isomorphic with the object, then one\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts are constructs. However, if this is what Marenbon means by constructivism, then inductive abstraction is quite compatible with realism. This stage of the process of forming ideas might simply be a means of correctly <i>identifying</i> the species or genera. If one\xE2\x80\x99s only experience of human beings was Socrates, it would take meeting Euthyphro to show that \xE2\x80\x9Chuman being\xE2\x80\x9D is not defined as \xE2\x80\x9Cwise and rational animal.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \n\
  <p>Marenbon, in his first of two interpretations, thinks there is some reason to view Boethius as a realist abstractionist, for he seems to be claiming (the text is a little vague) that the likeness that various singular things bear to one another (what some other thinkers call their \xE2\x80\x9Cnature,\xE2\x80\x9D though Boethius does not use this word) is both singular and universal: singular in extramental reality and universal when grasped in thought. When we abstract them from bodies, then, we are discovering things that really exist. And in fact, Boethius goes on to say that \xE2\x80\x9Cgenera and species subsist in one way, but are grasped by the intellect in another way.\xE2\x80\x9D But if the intellect grasps them as universals, then is this not constructivism? Marenbon does not offer any answer, but perhaps his idea is that because universality and singularity are not parts of the nature, the universality of one\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts does not count against identity with the object.</p>  \n\
  <p>However, Marenbon offers a second interpretation, inspired by what he calls the Modes of Cognition Principle. According to this principle, which plays an important role in the <i>Consolation</i>\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of divine foreknowledge and human freedom, the way a cognitive power cognizes something is determined by the nature of that power, not by the thing cognized. Reason, because of its nature, will grasp things through universals. According to Marenbon, if in fact Boethius is relying on this principle, then the view he presents will be a sort of constructivism, but one that makes a bow to realist abstractionism. But it is difficult to see why Marenbon reaches this conclusion. First, why does the introduction of the Modes of Cognition Principle make this view more constructivist than the view presented in the first interpretation? Perhaps, on this second interpretation, genera and species\xE2\x80\x94or perhaps we should say the natures identical to them\xE2\x80\x94do not exist in reality, even as particulars. But that would be hard to reconcile with Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s claim that they \xE2\x80\x9Csubsist in sensible things.\xE2\x80\x9D And if the Modes of Cognition Principle simply tells us that reason will grasp these genera and species as universals, then this view will be constructivist only to the extent that this implies a lack of identity between the contents of one\xE2\x80\x99s cognition and the extramental object of one\xE2\x80\x99s cognition. But this principle does not introduce any barrier that was not considered in the first interpretation, and so if the first one could count as realist abstractionism, I do not see why the introduction of the Modes of Cognition Principle would make any difference.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

  <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Opuscula Sacra</span></p>   \n\
  <p>Despite their wide variety of subject matter, the <i>Opuscula</i> were originally published together and, Marenbon argues, form a unit.  OS IV, <i>On the Catholic Faith</i>, sets out problems the rest will discuss. Each of OS I-III concerns a problem about predication involving God (and creatures as well, in OS III). And OS I, II, III, and V share a common method: Boethius appeals to Aristotelian philosophy, in particular logic, to expose flaws in his opponents\xE2\x80\x99 views, and uses the same philosophy to construct less assailable views. However, in the spirit of his neoplatonic predecessors, Boethius does not think that Aristotelian logic can be applied to God in the same way it can be applied to creatures; at some point the logical apparatus will simply break down. Still, he thinks it can it can provide us with \xE2\x80\x9Can analogy to guide us in our understanding\xE2\x80\x9D (76). Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s ideas about the relationship between faith and reason are implicit here. If logical incoherence shows a theological position is unacceptable, then Boethius sides with Origen against Tertullian in thinking faith and reason cannot conflict.</p>  \n\
  <p>Marenbon shows this methodology at work in OS V, which argues for an orthodox Christology against the heresies of Nestorius and Eutyches. Nestorius argued that because Christ has two natures he must be two persons. Eutyches, in contrast argued that because Christ is only one person, he must have only one nature. Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s goal is to explain how a single person can have two natures. In a move whose cleverness Marenbon makes apparent later, Boethius picks this Aristotelian definition from among several candidates: \xE2\x80\x9CNature is the specific <i>differentia</i> which informs a thing\xE2\x80\x9D (70, citing OS V 1.111-112). On the Porphyrian tree, a schema of universals on which a highest genus is divided and subdivided until the lowest species are found, it is <i>differentiae</i> that divide genera into species and thus constitute their natures.</p>  \n\
  <p>Boethius next offers a definition of \xE2\x80\x9Cperson\xE2\x80\x9D that would become the standard definition throughout the mediaeval period: \xE2\x80\x9CA person is an individual substance of a nature endowed with reason\xE2\x80\x9D (72, citing OS V 3.171-172). While this definition has the advantage of explaining how human beings, as well as the members of the Trinity, are all persons, it seems to violate a well accepted principle of orthodox Christian and even neoplatonist theology\xE2\x80\x94one that Boethius himself advocates: The transcendent God cannot be captured on the grid of the categories. Boethius recognizes this, however, and explains that God is a substance of a different sort from created substances. Like all substances, each divine person \xE2\x80\x9C<i>substat,</i>\xE2\x80\x9D that is, stands under. Created substances stand under, are subjects of, their properties. But each divine person stands under in the sense that it is the origin of all created things. In other words, the divine persons are ontological bedrock. The definition of \xE2\x80\x9Cperson,\xE2\x80\x9D formulated in terms of the categories, applies only by analogy to divine persons.</p>  \n\
  <p>Marenbon finds that Boethius has struck a serious blow to the heresies by removing their motivation. Nestorius and Eutyches formulate their views because they conceive of a nature as something individual; hence, if a being has more than one nature, it must be more than one person. However, Boethius defines \xE2\x80\x9Cnature\xE2\x80\x9D as something universal, and thereby removes the barrier to thinking that a single person could not have more than one nature. Marenbon is right to emphasize the originality of Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s solution, and he might have brought it out more vividly by contrasting Boethius with another party to this discussion, Cyril of Alexandria. Cyril battled against his contemporary Nestorius and in many particulars anticipated Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s account a century earlier. But Cyril too thought of natures as individual, and for that reason denied two natures in Christ, even though he argued for Christ\xE2\x80\x99s full divinity and humanity in a single person. Boethius\xE2\x80\x99 genius was to see how Aristotelian philosophy could make sense of the orthodox doctrine of Christ. Of course, Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s solution does not eliminate all the paradoxes of the orthodox view. It is still hard to see how a single person can have <i>these</i> two natures, which are so ontologically different. But in this respect, his view is no worse off than that of Eutyches, who holds that the single nature of Christ is somehow the result of combining divine and human nature.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
  </span></p> \n\
  <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Consolation of Philosophy</span></p>   \n\
  <p>By far the strongest and most interesting portion of the book is its detailed explication of the <i>Consolation</i> (96-163). Marenbon guides the reader through each key argument of the text, and his interpretations of the individual arguments reveal a brilliance in Boethius that other commentators sometimes miss. He also points out that the work suffers from incoherence: The positions Lady Philosophy argues for are deeply incompatible with each other. It is implausible that Boethius did not care about the incoherences on the grounds that he was simply writing a consolation for a general readership; for although he was indeed writing a consolation, it is, especially in its second half, full of difficult, technical argumentation. Marenbon argues instead that the incoherences are intentional, part of Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s plan for the <i>Consolation</i>. Although this might seem a desperate attempt to save Boethius from the bin of second-rate philosophers, Marenbon makes an interesting and fairly convincing case for this thesis. The <i>Consolation</i> belongs to the tradition of Menippean satire, prosimetric in form and satirical in content. By Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s time, however, the genre included works whose satirical content was quite subtle. Martianus Capella\xE2\x80\x99s <i>On the Marriage of Mercury and Philology</i>, for instance, is a work of \xE2\x80\x9Cearnest didacticism,\xE2\x80\x9D and yet Martianus \xE2\x80\x9Cencourages us to see that [his enterprise as an educator] has its pretensions and absurdities\xE2\x80\x9D (160-161). Boethius knew Martianus\xE2\x80\x99s work and may have been following in his footsteps. Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s work evinces enormous respect for philosophy, but Lady Philosophy\xE2\x80\x99s arguments, while they advance Boethius toward answering his questions, do not result in a coherent, fully satisfactory reply. Philosophy is no goddess; she is human, and it may be that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe pretensions of her goddess-like initial appearance are satirized in the <i>Consolation</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (162).</p>  \n\
  <p>The final chapter of the book traces Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s immensely successful post-mortem career. Influence is hard to measure, but by any standard Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s was enormous, and it extended not just to philosophy but to literature as well: The <i>Consolation</i> figures prominently not just in philosophical and theological texts, such as Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s treatment of happiness in the <i>Summa theologiae</i>, but in Jean de Meun\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Roman de la Rose</i> and Chaucer\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>. My only disagreement with Marenbon is that, in my view, he underestimates Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s influence. He claims, for example, that Anselm did not use the <i>Consolation</i> as a source for his moral philosophy (176).  However, in <i>On Freedom of Choice</i>, Anselm\xE2\x80\x99s arguments that the good are always strong, while the wicked are weak, made slaves to sin by their own choice, are at least echoes of Book IV. Anselm\xE2\x80\x99s dialogues also show the influence of Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s logical works, especially the works on topical reasoning.</p>"

Boethius recognizes this, however, and explains that God is a substance of a different sort from created substances. Like all substances, each divine person \xE2\x80\x9C<i>substat,</i>\xE2\x80\x9D that is, stands under. Created substances stand under, are subjects of, their properties. But each divine person stands under in the sense that it is the origin of all created things. In other words, the divine persons are ontological bedrock. The definition of \xE2\x80\x9Cperson,\xE2\x80\x9D formulated in terms of the categories, applies only by analogy to divine persons.</p>  \n\
  <p>Marenbon finds that Boethius has struck a serious blow to the heresies by removing their motivation. Nestorius and Eutyches formulate their views because they conceive of a nature as something individual; hence, if a being has more than one nature, it must be more than one person. However, Boethius defines \xE2\x80\x9Cnature\xE2\x80\x9D as something universal, and thereby removes the barrier to thinking that a single person could not have more than one nature. Marenbon is right to emphasize the originality of Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s solution, and he might have brought it out more vividly by contrasting Boethius with another party to this discussion, Cyril of Alexandria. Cyril battled against his contemporary Nestorius and in many particulars anticipated Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s account a century earlier. But Cyril too thought of natures as individual, and for that reason denied two natures in Christ, even though he argued for Christ\xE2\x80\x99s full divinity and humanity in a single person. Boethius\xE2\x80\x99 genius was to see how Aristotelian philosophy could make sense of the orthodox doctrine of Christ. Of course, Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s solution does not eliminate all the paradoxes of the orthodox view. It is still hard to see how a single person can have <i>these</i> two natures, which are so ontologically different. But in this respect, his view is no worse off than that of Eutyches, who holds that the single nature of Christ is somehow the result of combining divine and human nature.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

  <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Consolation of Philosophy</span></p>   \n\
  <p>By far the strongest and most interesting portion of the book is its detailed explication of the <i>Consolation</i> (96-163). Marenbon guides the reader through each key argument of the text, and his interpretations of the individual arguments reveal a brilliance in Boethius that other commentators sometimes miss. He also points out that the work suffers from incoherence: The positions Lady Philosophy argues for are deeply incompatible with each other. It is implausible that Boethius did not care about the incoherences on the grounds that he was simply writing a consolation for a general readership; for although he was indeed writing a consolation, it is, especially in its second half, full of difficult, technical argumentation. Marenbon argues instead that the incoherences are intentional, part of Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s plan for the <i>Consolation</i>. Although this might seem a desperate attempt to save Boethius from the bin of second-rate philosophers, Marenbon makes an interesting and fairly convincing case for this thesis. The <i>Consolation</i> belongs to the tradition of Menippean satire, prosimetric in form and satirical in content. By Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s time, however, the genre included works whose satirical content was quite subtle. Martianus Capella\xE2\x80\x99s <i>On the Marriage of Mercury and Philology</i>, for instance, is a work of \xE2\x80\x9Cearnest didacticism,\xE2\x80\x9D and yet Martianus \xE2\x80\x9Cencourages us to see that [his enterprise as an educator] has its pretensions and absurdities\xE2\x80\x9D (160-161). Boethius knew Martianus\xE2\x80\x99s work and may have been following in his footsteps. Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s work evinces enormous respect for philosophy, but Lady Philosophy\xE2\x80\x99s arguments, while they advance Boethius toward answering his questions, do not result in a coherent, fully satisfactory reply. Philosophy is no goddess; she is human, and it may be that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe pretensions of her goddess-like initial appearance are satirized in the <i>Consolation</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (162).</p>  \n\
  <p>The final chapter of the book traces Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s immensely successful post-mortem career. Influence is hard to measure, but by any standard Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s was enormous, and it extended not just to philosophy but to literature as well: The <i>Consolation</i> figures prominently not just in philosophical and theological texts, such as Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s treatment of happiness in the <i>Summa theologiae</i>, but in Jean de Meun\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Roman de la Rose</i> and Chaucer\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>. My only disagreement with Marenbon is that, in my view, he underestimates Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s influence. He claims, for example, that Anselm did not use the <i>Consolation</i> as a source for his moral philosophy (176).  However, in <i>On Freedom of Choice</i>, Anselm\xE2\x80\x99s arguments that the good are always strong, while the wicked are weak, made slaves to sin by their own choice, are at least echoes of Book IV. Anselm\xE2\x80\x99s dialogues also show the influence of Boethius\xE2\x80\x99s logical works, especially the works on topical reasoning.</p>"
