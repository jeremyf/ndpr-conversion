content: "<p>The range of issues discussed in this collection of recent essays by J\xC3\xBCrgen Habermas is suggested by the title of its Introduction: \xE2\x80\x9CRealism after the linguistic turn\xE2\x80\x9D. Habermas says that that turn shifted \xE2\x80\x9Cthe standard of epistemic objectivity from the private certainty of an experiencing subject to the public practice of justification within a communicative community\xE2\x80\x9D. It thereby encouraged a \xE2\x80\x9Ccontextualist challenge to the realist intuition\xE2\x80\x9D, for it raised the question of \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether any sense of context-independent validity can be salvaged from the concept of truth\xE2\x80\x9D (249).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Habermas formulates this challenge in the terms suggested by the title of one of the essays: \xE2\x80\x9CFrom Kant to Hegel and back again: the move toward detranscendentalization\xE2\x80\x9D. His expositions and criticisms of the work of Robert Brandom, Hilary Putman, and other contemporary philosophers are written with an eye to the Kant-Hegel contrast\xE2\x80\x94the opposition between the universalism aimed at by transcendental philosophy and the particularism and localism necessitated by Hegelian historicism.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Habermas is one of the few philosophers who is as much at home with Hegel, Hamann and Heidegger as he is with Davidson, Sellars and Dummett. So he is able to move back and forth, smoothly and perspicuously, between small-scale critical analyses and insightful historical comparisons and generalizations. The result is a survey of the contemporary philosophical scene that is far more imaginative, and far more stimulating, than the sort found in books whose authors\xE2\x80\x99 range of reference is limited to the last few decades\xE2\x80\x99 worth of work within analytic philosophy.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This book will be of great interest both to students of Habermas\xE2\x80\x99 universalistic discourse ethics and to philosophers interested in the debate between philosophers sympathetic to Wittgenstein and to pragmatism (such as Davidson, Putnam and Brandom) and their critics\xE2\x80\x94especially those critics who, after conceding a great deal to Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s attack on empiricism, are still concerned to preserve what McDowell calls \xE2\x80\x9Canswerability to the world\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Habermas regards Brandom as representing \xE2\x80\x9Cthe state of the art of pragmatic approaches in analytic philosophy of language\xE2\x80\x9D, but thinks that Brandom\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cassimilation of the objectivity of experience to the intersubjectivity of communication is reminiscent of an infamous Hegelian move\xE2\x80\x9D (7-8). He reads Brandom as an arch-contextualist, whose inferentialist theory of the nature of propositional content \xE2\x80\x9Cobliterates the distinction between the intersubjectively shared lifeworld and the objective world\xE2\x80\x9D. Brandom, he says, \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes not rescue the realist intuitions by recourse to the contingent constraints of a world that is supposed to exist independently and for everyone\xE2\x80\x9D (155), and so is driven to a linguistified version of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s objective idealism.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Habermas argues that we need a concept of empirical truth that \xE2\x80\x9Cconnects the result of successful justification with something in the objective world\xE2\x80\x9D (42). This means keeping intact the distinction between the availability of a \xE2\x80\x9Cjustification-independent point of reference\xE2\x80\x9D for assertions of empirical fact and the absence of such a point of reference when we turn to moral judgments and norms. In morality, he says, we lack \xE2\x80\x9Cthe ontological connotation of reference to things about which we can state facts\xE2\x80\x9D (42). So he criticizes Brandom\xE2\x80\x99s refusal to accept any version of the Kantian distinction between theoretical and practical uses of reason.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Habermas treats Putnam more sympathetically. He shares Putnam\xE2\x80\x99s fear of relativism, and thinks that Putnam succeeds in offering a \xE2\x80\x9Ctheory of direct reference\xE2\x80\x9D that enables us to \xE2\x80\x9Crecognize objects under different descriptions, or if, necessary, across paradigms\xE2\x80\x9D (219). But, although he thinks Putnam to be sounder than Brandom on the subject of empirical truth, he is dubious about the absence of what he calls \xE2\x80\x9Cthe moment of unconditionality\xE2\x80\x9D in Putnam\xE2\x80\x99s account of moral norms. Putnam\xE2\x80\x99s Deweyan and Aristotelian \xE2\x80\x9Cvirtue ethics\xE2\x80\x9D, he thinks, does not do justice to the distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Ca universalist morality of justice and particularist ethics of the good life\xE2\x80\x9D (228).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Throughout this book, Habermas is concerned to keep distinctions in place that Hegelians and pragmatists urge us to dissolve. In particular, he sees the historicism common to Hegel, Heidegger and Dewey as endangering Kantian claims to the universal validity of, for example, the prohibition against torture. He is not willing to think of that prohibition as something local and recent\xE2\x80\x94an innovation of the European Enlightenment. He insists that such absolute prohibitions are grounded in the nature of linguistic communication\xE2\x80\x94in the ability of human beings to give and ask for reasons. He sees pragmatism\xE2\x80\x99s assimilation of empirical truth to practical advantage as smoothing the way for moral relativism.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Like Putnam and the late Bernard Williams, Habermas wants to naturalize and de-transcendentalize philosophy, and to disconnect morality from metaphysics. So he is willing to concede a lot of ground to Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s polemics against Plato\xE2\x80\x94and in particular to give up on the correspondence theory of truth. But he nevertheless holds on both to claims of unconditionality and to what he calls \xE2\x80\x9Cthe natural Platonism of the lifeworld\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94a Platonism that insists on \xE2\x80\x9Ca justification-transcendent standard for orienting ourselves by context-independent truth-claims\xE2\x80\x9D (254).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The philosophers whom Habermas thinks have gone too far in an Hegelian direction agree with him that in the modern world \xE2\x80\x9Cthe moral universe loses the appearance of an ontological given and comes to be seen as a <i>construct</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (263). But they differ from him on two points: (1) whether to respond to this change by giving up the notion of \xE2\x80\x9Can ontological given\xE2\x80\x9D across the board--in empirical science as well as in morality; (2) whether, after recognizing the moral universe to be a construct, we need worry about whether it is a local construct or whether it contains elements that are more than merely local.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>One\xE2\x80\x99s reaction to Habermas\xE2\x80\x99 new book will depend on whether one believes that retention of something like the \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural Platonism\xE2\x80\x9D of common sense is essential to our hopes for a decent society, or instead thinks that a change in common sense might help us realize these hopes. Those who follow Dewey in thinking of context-independence as a Platonist shibboleth will see Habermas as trying to nudge us back from Hegel to Kant at just the wrong moment\xE2\x80\x94the moment when Hegelian ideas are beginning to revitalize analytic philosophy of mind and language. But if one thinks that Plato and Kant were on to something that Hegel was wrong to abandon--that playing the game of giving and asking for reasons requires both the notion of ontological givenness and that of unconditional obligation--then one will find this book very welcome indeed. Both sorts of readers will find the book as broad-gauged as it is incisive, and as forcefully argued as it is fair-minded.</p>"
