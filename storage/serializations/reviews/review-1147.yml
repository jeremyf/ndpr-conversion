content: "<p>This short but concentrated book makes a rigorous attempt to see Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Poetics</i> as fully embedded within the framework of Aristotelian ontology. Taking the philosopher\xE2\x80\x99s entire corpus to be systematically unified by \xE2\x80\x98substantive-methodological conceptual constants\xE2\x80\x99, Husain argues that some of the most important of these constants (above all, the ontological/cognitive priority of primary substance, <i>ousia</i>, and the principle of form-matter constitution) can be traced at work, both explicitly and implicitly, within the <i>Poetics</i>. She presents as a schema of ontological levels the theoretical steps by which the treatise expounds a distinctive subject-matter through generic and specific conceptions of mimetic, i.e. representational, art. It does so, she believes, by presupposing \xE2\x80\x93 certainly not by spelling out, contrary to a common mistake about the work \xE2\x80\x93 Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s tenet that all human craft (<i>techne</i>) stands in a \xE2\x80\x98mimetic\xE2\x80\x99 relationship to nature (Husain calls this <i>mimesis 1</i>) and by defining \xE2\x80\x98artistic\xE2\x80\x99 <i>techne</i> generically in terms of its representational content (<i>mimesis 2</i>); poetic <i>techne</i> is then delimited in terms of its verbal (and related) materials, and tragic art further demarcated with reference to the special kind of action, embodied in the \xE2\x80\x98structural-emotive\xE2\x80\x99 entity of a tragic plot (<i>mythos</i>), that constitutes its being. All <i>techne</i> produces artificial substances that are analogous, in form-matter constitution and formal-final causality, to natural substances. Every tragedy is a substance with its own ontological imperative, independent of both its maker and its audience.</p>   \n\
  <p>Husain\xE2\x80\x99s approach to the <i>Poetics</i> brings with it three salient consequences. The first is that catharsis, because part of the formal definition of tragedy\xE2\x80\x99s essence, is deemed a process of causal \xE2\x80\x98clarification\xE2\x80\x99 within the dramatic action, not the psychological effect of a play on an audience. The second is that Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x98severely selective emphasis on <i>mythos</i>\xE2\x80\x99 (53), with its concomitant subordination of other elements of tragedy (including characterization), involves, according to Husain, a \xE2\x80\x98profound refocusing\xE2\x80\x99 (57) of the idea of action, and one that reflects sharp divergence between the perspectives of the <i>Poetics</i> and the <i>Ethics</i>: the action of the former, supposedly because of <i>hamartia</i> (which Husain treats very skimpily, 61-2), is an \xE2\x80\x98impersonal causal agency\xE2\x80\x99 (59) in which the characters of the human agents play no causal role (62), so that the agent-centered viewpoint of the <i>Ethics</i> is irrelevant to the interpretation of tragedy (\xE2\x80\x98ethical and tragic action are not only different but incompatible\xE2\x80\x99, 87). The third consequence, overlapping with the second, is that the <i>Poetics</i> allegedly entails a clear separation between mimetic art and life: the standards of poetic art are entirely \xE2\x80\x98autotelic\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x98objective\xE2\x80\x99; only art, not life, can for Aristotle be \xE2\x80\x98tragic\xE2\x80\x99; there is \xE2\x80\x98little that art can teach us about life\xE2\x80\x99 (89). If that seems a paradoxical upshot for a reading of a work that frames poetry as the mimesis of life (<i>Poetics</i> 6.1450a16-17), Husain acknowledges the paradox but locates it in Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s position, not her own. I shall return to this issue.</p>   \n\
  <p>This book is lucidly written and compactly reasoned. It wastes few words and manages to develop its thesis in a progressively interesting manner. Its arguments will repay close attention from anyone concerned with interpretation of the <i>Poetics</i> at an advanced level. Especially instructive is Husain\xE2\x80\x99s sustained engagement with \xE2\x80\x93 indeed endorsement of \xE2\x80\x93 the markedly objectivist slant of Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s thinking about mimetic art. (Husain, incidentally, is happy to identify \xE2\x80\x98<i>mimesis 2</i>\xE2\x80\x99 with representation, e.g. 36, 47, but regrettably retains \xE2\x80\x98imitation\xE2\x80\x99 as her stock translation.) I have, however, serious qualms about two central planks of her case: first, her understanding of the place of pity and fear, and therefore catharsis, in the definition of tragedy; second, the breach that she posits between Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s understanding of tragic action in art and ethical action in life.</p>   \n\
  <p>First, then, the seemingly inevitable crux of catharsis. Husain chooses not to discuss the matter head-on as an interpretative problem nor to contextualize her own stance <i>vis-\xC3\xA0-vis</i> the long history of controversy surrounding the term (for which see my book, <i>Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s Poetics</i>, London, 1986/1998, appendix 5). Neither does she offer a philologically informed account of the catharsis clause itself. She introduces her view abruptly in an undefended translation of the clause as meaning: \xE2\x80\x98achieving the clarification of how pitiful and fearsome actions cause like things to befall\xE2\x80\x99 (42). To anyone familiar with the difficulties of the most notorious ten words in all Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s writings this translation is deeply perplexing: taken as a whole, it is linguistically impossible. It is one thing to translate <i>katharsis</i> itself as \xE2\x80\x98clarification\xE2\x80\x99 (others have done this, though <i>\xC3\xA0 propos</i> the audience\xE2\x80\x99s understanding) or to take the noun <i>pathematon</i> to mean events (\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\xA6things to befall\xE2\x80\x99, though on 44 Husain explicitly renders the word as \xE2\x80\x98afflictions\xE2\x80\x99) rather than emotions (again not new, though a minority position). Even to take \xE2\x80\x98pity and fear\xE2\x80\x99 to mean \xE2\x80\x98pitiful and fearsome actions\xE2\x80\x99, though tendentious, is not unprecedented. Add these three things together, though, and one has an extreme interpretation that strains Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s Greek. But worst of all, Husain takes an instrumental use of the preposition <i>dia</i> (\xE2\x80\x98by means of (pity and fear)\xE2\x80\x99) to have <i>causal</i> force, distorts the syntax of the clause grotesquely, and on this basis makes the catharsis clause denote \xE2\x80\x98the clarification of the action\xE2\x80\x99s sequential-causal structure (<i>dia</i>)\xE2\x80\x99 (44). To make matters worse, her translation imports a peculiar emphasis (on pitiful/fearsome events causing <i>other such</i> events to befall) which she never explains and which I cannot match with Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s own arguments. Finally, not only does she ignore the much-cited parallel reference to catharsis in <i>Politics</i> 8.6-7, 1341a-2a (where it is a phenomenon, something undergone by the hearers of certain kinds of music, and pity and fear are specified as possible objects of it), she does not even admit its existence.</p>   \n\
  <p>This last point is doubly telling. First, Husain constantly insists on the unity of the corpus and on interpreting \xE2\x80\x98Aristotle from Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99, yet she allows herself to ignore a passage in which Aristotle says that he intends to elucidate his concept of catharsis \xE2\x80\x98in the <i>Poetics</i>\xE2\x80\x99 (or, at the very least, in a discussion of poetry): what does this deliberate silence say about the cogency of Husain\xE2\x80\x99s method? Secondly, while the <i>Politics</i> passage itself raises complex interpretative problems (for the best recent treatment see Richard Kraut, <i>Aristotle Politics Books VII and VIII</i>, Oxford, 1997, 208-12), what is beyond reasonable dispute is that its cross-reference to the/a <i>Poetics</i> establishes a connection between the concepts of catharsis in the two works, and therefore that catharsis in the <i>Poetics</i> has something to do with the experience of pity and fear by audiences and cannot be a wholly self-contained feature of tragic plot-structure.</p>   \n\
  <p>If the evidence of the <i>Politics</i> counts heavily against Husain (without, I should stress, <i>settling</i> the whole question of what catharsis means in the <i>Poetics</i>), what can she pit against it? The answer is the following argument. Given the logic of definition in Aristotle, the catharsis clause must \xE2\x80\x98fall under\xE2\x80\x99 one of the three differentiae used in the definition of tragedy; that differentia can only be \xE2\x80\x98action\xE2\x80\x99, the central object of tragic mimesis (it cannot be either the materials or the dramatic mode of representation); and so catharsis cannot refer to the experience of the audience of tragedy, which is not part of the formal definition of the genre. <i>Prima facie</i> we face here a clash between a logical appeal to the protocols of Aristotelian definition and the unequivocal indications of a conceptual link supplied by a cross-reference in another Aristotelian treatise. Even if this were so, Husain\xE2\x80\x99s total silence about the second part of the dilemma would be mystifying. As it is, there is nothing in Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s method of definition which, when adapted to an art form like tragedy (and it remains doubtful how \xE2\x80\x98scientific\xE2\x80\x99 a case of definition this is), prevents him from predicating essentially of the genre a capacity to arouse certain emotions in an (appropriately receptive) audience and by doing so achieve a result called catharsis, whatever exactly he understands by this last term. Husain is justified in believing, like many previous interpreters, that the emotive properties of tragedy are, for Aristotle, \xE2\x80\x98objectively\xE2\x80\x99 constitutive of its nature, but wrong to reason that emotive content is somehow self-sufficiently intrinsic to the artwork rather than a function of its normatively stipulated effect on a recipient. (The point could be elaborated with application to the role of pleasure in Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s theory.)</p>   \n\
  <p>As it happens, another part of <i>Politics</i> 8 can be pertinently deployed to show what is one-sided about Husain\xE2\x80\x99s view of the \xE2\x80\x98structural-emotive\xE2\x80\x99 status of tragic action. When Aristotle discusses music as a mimetic art at <i>Politics</i> 8.5, 1340a, he speaks of music\xE2\x80\x99s ethico-emotional properties (<i>ethika</i>), its \xE2\x80\x98likenesses\xE2\x80\x99 to forms of human <i>ethos</i>, as properties \xE2\x80\x98in\xE2\x80\x99 the forms of the music but also necessarily realized in the experience of the hearer: \xE2\x80\x98rhythms and melodies contain likenesses (homoiomata) \xE2\x80\xA6 of ethical traits (<i>ethika</i>); this is clear in practice, since our state of mind is changed (<i>metaballomen\xE2\x80\xA6ten psuchen</i>) as we listen to such music.\xE2\x80\x99 What this passage demonstrates is that for Aristotle there need not, indeed cannot, be an intrinsic/extrinsic <i>dichotomy</i>, of the kind Husain postulates, between the emotive properties of artworks and their experience by suitably attuned audiences. The <i>Poetics</i>\xE2\x80\x99 account of tragedy accordingly presupposes <i>an implicitly normative audience</i>; there is no way Aristotle could make sense of \xE2\x80\x98the pitiful\xE2\x80\x99, however objectively defined, without such a presupposition. That this is indeed the logic of the tragic emotions in his argument is confirmed, to cite just one example, by 14.1453b1-7 (never discussed by Husain), where the emotive properties of a plot-structure are explicitly cashed out in terms of the relevant response on the part of an auditor \xE2\x80\x93 precisely parallel to the case of music in the <i>Politics</i>. Husain is right to maintain that Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s theory cannot be essentially dependent on actual audiences; but Aristotle also accepts the existence of properly sensitive, discerning audiences that give empirical support to the theory (see esp. 13.1453a26-30). Husain\xE2\x80\x99s own partial assimilation of this point (63) comes too late to do justice to the interdependence of internal and external in Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s model of tragic emotions.</p>   \n\
  <p>I move now to my second main disagreement with this book. Husain argues that while Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s ethical thought requires an agent-centered view of human life, the <i>Poetics</i> employs an object-centered view: ethical actions are derivative from the characters of their agents, but tragic action is quite different, centered on <i>impersonal</i> causality (59). Husain\xE2\x80\x99s case here depends above all on <i>Poetics</i> chapter 8, where Aristotle criticizes the assumption that unity of poetic plot-structure can be secured by focus on a single agent as opposed to a single action (<i>praxis</i>). However, Husain over-interprets this contrast. The contrast states that a single, central character is neither sufficient nor necessary for unity of action, but it does not follow that it \xE2\x80\x98sharply contrasts the agent-focused structure of life with the action-focused one of art\xE2\x80\x99 (126 n. 18). Aristotle insists on a unified <i>praxis</i> as a \xE2\x80\x98single object\xE2\x80\x99 of poetic mimesis (<i>Poetics</i> 8.1451a30-32) and treats action in this depersonalized sense as the formal essence of a tragedy without thereby excluding ethical human agency from the domain of poetic representation. It is true, in other words, that the plot-structure of <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i> is not, <i>qua</i> single, unified \xE2\x80\x98action\xE2\x80\x99, itself an exercise of ethical agency, but equally true that the play, in its entirety, remains a mimesis of ethical agents and action(s) (note Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s use of the plural <i>praxeis</i> at e.g. 1450a22, 1453b16, a detail consistently ignored by Husain). Nor does the contrast drawn in <i>Poetics</i> chapter 8 prevent Aristotle from framing his conception of the ideal tragedy, in chapter 13, specifically by reference to a certain kind of central agent (1453a7-12 \xE2\x80\x93 a point evaded by Husain, 62).</p>   \n\
  <p>By eliding different senses or aspects of <i>praxis</i> in the <i>Poetics</i> Husain occludes the ethical implications of Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s broader conception of action(s) as the object of poetic representation. Husain asserts that even the <i>Ethics</i>\xE2\x80\x99 vocabulary of the agent (<i>ho pratton</i>) is \xE2\x80\x98absent\xE2\x80\x99 from the <i>Poetics</i>, and, correlatively, that \xE2\x80\x98ethical character appears in the plural (<i>ethe</i>) rather than in the singular (<i>ethos</i>) and disjoined from <i>dianoia</i>\xE2\x80\x99. All this is misleading: (1) the vocabulary of \xE2\x80\x98the agent(s)\xE2\x80\x99 occurs as the object of mimesis at e.g. <i>Poetics</i> 1448a1, 1448a23-8, 1450a6, 1450b4; (2) <i>ethos</i> occurs in <i>both</i> singular and plural (with varying nuances, which Husain never considers) in the <i>Poetics</i> (for the singular see e.g. 1449b38, 1450a2, 1450a14, 1450a29, 1450b8), <i>as it does also</i> in the <i>Ethics</i> (for the plural there see e.g. 1121b6, 1127b23, 1145a16); (3) so far from being \xE2\x80\x98disjoined\xE2\x80\x99, <i>ethos</i> and <i>dianoia</i> are expressly coupled at <i>Poetics</i> 6.1449b36-50a2 (an important passage never discussed by Husain), which also shows that the mimesis of <i>praxis</i> in the <i>Poetics</i> actually implies the mimesis of agents, and agents, furthermore, who are, in the finest works, ethically characterized.</p>   \n\
  <p>Where, then, does this leave Husain\xE2\x80\x99s thesis that the <i>Poetics</i> opens up clear distance between \xE2\x80\x98art\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x98life\xE2\x80\x99 (and is right to do so)? The thesis legitimately identifies a point of tension in Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s theory, though such tension may be inescapable for any rich conception of mimesis, avoidable only by either reducing mimesis to the <i>replication</i> of life or attempting to affirm sheer autonomy for art. (See my new book, <i>The Aesthetics of Mimesis: Ancient Texts and Modern Problems</i>, Princeton, 2002.). Husain journeys in the second of these directions, but she balks at going all the way (see her belated remarks on art\xE2\x80\x99s partial \xE2\x80\x98similarity\xE2\x80\x99 to life, 70-77, 103-5). Even so, the \xE2\x80\x98autotelic\xE2\x80\x99 status she ascribes to tragic and other artforms goes beyond Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s own carefully nuanced position; the distinctive poetic standards of <i>Poetics</i> 25 are not entirely severed from those of \xE2\x80\x98life\xE2\x80\x99. Observe here the peculiar language used in Husain\xE2\x80\x99s claim that from an Aristotelian viewpoint \xE2\x80\x98a work of art\xE2\x80\xA6is a self-referential, self-significant, and self-worthy analogue of a living animal\xE2\x80\x99 (98, cf. 34). It would be hard to translate the compound adjectives in this proposition into Aristotelian terms: \xE2\x80\x98self-referential\xE2\x80\x99 in particular flatly contradicts the <i>Poetics</i>\xE2\x80\x99 notion of mimesis as the representation of \xE2\x80\x98life\xE2\x80\x99. Husain does not in the end escape her own tensions: all artworks, she thinks, form an \xE2\x80\x98<i>auto-telic</i> microcosm\xE2\x80\x99 (107, her italics), independent of anything \xE2\x80\x98extrinsic\xE2\x80\x99; but the idea of a microcosm requires that of a macrocosm. An Aristotelian aesthetics is rooted in the hope that art can help its audiences to comprehend the forms and possibilities of the human world a little better (<i>Poetics</i> chapter 4, never confronted by Husain) \xE2\x80\x93 a hope not to be equated with \xE2\x80\x98didacticism\xE2\x80\x99 or a \xE2\x80\x98mirror of life\xE2\x80\x99 model, contrary to Husain\xE2\x80\x99s briskly reductive depiction of readings different from her own (89-90).</p>   \n\
  <p>A common thread in the criticisms sketched above is the thought that Husain pursues her approach so single-mindedly (as well as, at times, with a damagingly selective deployment of textual evidence) that she ends up being more \xE2\x80\x98Aristotelian\xE2\x80\x99 than Aristotle himself. By insisting on the supposed purity of certain methodological and conceptual principles, she misses the realistic suppleness of thought that is just as vital to Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s cast of mind as any individual doctrine.</p>"

First, Husain constantly insists on the unity of the corpus and on interpreting \xE2\x80\x98Aristotle from Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99, yet she allows herself to ignore a passage in which Aristotle says that he intends to elucidate his concept of catharsis \xE2\x80\x98in the <i>Poetics</i>\xE2\x80\x99 (or, at the very least, in a discussion of poetry): what does this deliberate silence say about the cogency of Husain\xE2\x80\x99s method? Secondly, while the <i>Politics</i> passage itself raises complex interpretative problems (for the best recent treatment see Richard Kraut, <i>Aristotle Politics Books VII and VIII</i>, Oxford, 1997, 208-12), what is beyond reasonable dispute is that its cross-reference to the/a <i>Poetics</i> establishes a connection between the concepts of catharsis in the two works, and therefore that catharsis in the <i>Poetics</i> has something to do with the experience of pity and fear by audiences and cannot be a wholly self-contained feature of tragic plot-structure.</p>   \n\
  <p>If the evidence of the <i>Politics</i> counts heavily against Husain (without, I should stress, <i>settling</i> the whole question of what catharsis means in the <i>Poetics</i>), what can she pit against it? The answer is the following argument. Given the logic of definition in Aristotle, the catharsis clause must \xE2\x80\x98fall under\xE2\x80\x99 one of the three differentiae used in the definition of tragedy; that differentia can only be \xE2\x80\x98action\xE2\x80\x99, the central object of tragic mimesis (it cannot be either the materials or the dramatic mode of representation); and so catharsis cannot refer to the experience of the audience of tragedy, which is not part of the formal definition of the genre. <i>Prima facie</i> we face here a clash between a logical appeal to the protocols of Aristotelian definition and the unequivocal indications of a conceptual link supplied by a cross-reference in another Aristotelian treatise. Even if this were so, Husain\xE2\x80\x99s total silence about the second part of the dilemma would be mystifying. As it is, there is nothing in Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s method of definition which, when adapted to an art form like tragedy (and it remains doubtful how \xE2\x80\x98scientific\xE2\x80\x99 a case of definition this is), prevents him from predicating essentially of the genre a capacity to arouse certain emotions in an (appropriately receptive) audience and by doing so achieve a result called catharsis, whatever exactly he understands by this last term. Husain is justified in believing, like many previous interpreters, that the emotive properties of tragedy are, for Aristotle, \xE2\x80\x98objectively\xE2\x80\x99 constitutive of its nature, but wrong to reason that emotive content is somehow self-sufficiently intrinsic to the artwork rather than a function of its normatively stipulated effect on a recipient. (The point could be elaborated with application to the role of pleasure in Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s theory.)</p>   \n\
  <p>As it happens, another part of <i>Politics</i> 8 can be pertinently deployed to show what is one-sided about Husain\xE2\x80\x99s view of the \xE2\x80\x98structural-emotive\xE2\x80\x99 status of tragic action. When Aristotle discusses music as a mimetic art at <i>Politics</i> 8.5, 1340a, he speaks of music\xE2\x80\x99s ethico-emotional properties (<i>ethika</i>), its \xE2\x80\x98likenesses\xE2\x80\x99 to forms of human <i>ethos</i>, as properties \xE2\x80\x98in\xE2\x80\x99 the forms of the music but also necessarily realized in the experience of the hearer: \xE2\x80\x98rhythms and melodies contain likenesses (homoiomata) \xE2\x80\xA6 of ethical traits (<i>ethika</i>); this is clear in practice, since our state of mind is changed (<i>metaballomen\xE2\x80\xA6ten psuchen</i>) as we listen to such music.\xE2\x80\x99 What this passage demonstrates is that for Aristotle there need not, indeed cannot, be an intrinsic/extrinsic <i>dichotomy</i>, of the kind Husain postulates, between the emotive properties of artworks and their experience by suitably attuned audiences. The <i>Poetics</i>\xE2\x80\x99 account of tragedy accordingly presupposes <i>an implicitly normative audience</i>; there is no way Aristotle could make sense of \xE2\x80\x98the pitiful\xE2\x80\x99, however objectively defined, without such a presupposition. That this is indeed the logic of the tragic emotions in his argument is confirmed, to cite just one example, by 14.1453b1-7 (never discussed by Husain), where the emotive properties of a plot-structure are explicitly cashed out in terms of the relevant response on the part of an auditor \xE2\x80\x93 precisely parallel to the case of music in the <i>Politics</i>. Husain is right to maintain that Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s theory cannot be essentially dependent on actual audiences; but Aristotle also accepts the existence of properly sensitive, discerning audiences that give empirical support to the theory (see esp. 13.1453a26-30). Husain\xE2\x80\x99s own partial assimilation of this point (63) comes too late to do justice to the interdependence of internal and external in Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s model of tragic emotions.</p>   \n\
  <p>I move now to my second main disagreement with this book. Husain argues that while Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s ethical thought requires an agent-centered view of human life, the <i>Poetics</i> employs an object-centered view: ethical actions are derivative from the characters of their agents, but tragic action is quite different, centered on <i>impersonal</i> causality (59). Husain\xE2\x80\x99s case here depends above all on <i>Poetics</i> chapter 8, where Aristotle criticizes the assumption that unity of poetic plot-structure can be secured by focus on a single agent as opposed to a single action (<i>praxis</i>). However, Husain over-interprets this contrast. The contrast states that a single, central character is neither sufficient nor necessary for unity of action, but it does not follow that it \xE2\x80\x98sharply contrasts the agent-focused structure of life with the action-focused one of art\xE2\x80\x99 (126 n. 18). Aristotle insists on a unified <i>praxis</i> as a \xE2\x80\x98single object\xE2\x80\x99 of poetic mimesis (<i>Poetics</i> 8.1451a30-32) and treats action in this depersonalized sense as the formal essence of a tragedy without thereby excluding ethical human agency from the domain of poetic representation. It is true, in other words, that the plot-structure of <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i> is not, <i>qua</i> single, unified \xE2\x80\x98action\xE2\x80\x99, itself an exercise of ethical agency, but equally true that the play, in its entirety, remains a mimesis of ethical agents and action(s) (note Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s use of the plural <i>praxeis</i> at e.g. 1450a22, 1453b16, a detail consistently ignored by Husain). Nor does the contrast drawn in <i>Poetics</i> chapter 8 prevent Aristotle from framing his conception of the ideal tragedy, in chapter 13, specifically by reference to a certain kind of central agent (1453a7-12 \xE2\x80\x93 a point evaded by Husain, 62).</p>   \n\
  <p>By eliding different senses or aspects of <i>praxis</i> in the <i>Poetics</i> Husain occludes the ethical implications of Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s broader conception of action(s) as the object of poetic representation. Husain asserts that even the <i>Ethics</i>\xE2\x80\x99 vocabulary of the agent (<i>ho pratton</i>) is \xE2\x80\x98absent\xE2\x80\x99 from the <i>Poetics</i>, and, correlatively, that \xE2\x80\x98ethical character appears in the plural (<i>ethe</i>) rather than in the singular (<i>ethos</i>) and disjoined from <i>dianoia</i>\xE2\x80\x99. All this is misleading: (1) the vocabulary of \xE2\x80\x98the agent(s)\xE2\x80\x99 occurs as the object of mimesis at e.g. <i>Poetics</i> 1448a1, 1448a23-8, 1450a6, 1450b4; (2) <i>ethos</i> occurs in <i>both</i> singular and plural (with varying nuances, which Husain never considers) in the <i>Poetics</i> (for the singular see e.g. 1449b38, 1450a2, 1450a14, 1450a29, 1450b8), <i>as it does also</i> in the <i>Ethics</i> (for the plural there see e.g. 1121b6, 1127b23, 1145a16); (3) so far from being \xE2\x80\x98disjoined\xE2\x80\x99, <i>ethos</i> and <i>dianoia</i> are expressly coupled at <i>Poetics</i> 6.1449b36-50a2 (an important passage never discussed by Husain), which also shows that the mimesis of <i>praxis</i> in the <i>Poetics</i> actually implies the mimesis of agents, and agents, furthermore, who are, in the finest works, ethically characterized.</p>   \n\
  <p>Where, then, does this leave Husain\xE2\x80\x99s thesis that the <i>Poetics</i> opens up clear distance between \xE2\x80\x98art\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x98life\xE2\x80\x99 (and is right to do so)? The thesis legitimately identifies a point of tension in Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s theory, though such tension may be inescapable for any rich conception of mimesis, avoidable only by either reducing mimesis to the <i>replication</i> of life or attempting to affirm sheer autonomy for art. (See my new book, <i>The Aesthetics of Mimesis: Ancient Texts and Modern Problems</i>, Princeton, 2002.). Husain journeys in the second of these directions, but she balks at going all the way (see her belated remarks on art\xE2\x80\x99s partial \xE2\x80\x98similarity\xE2\x80\x99 to life, 70-77, 103-5). Even so, the \xE2\x80\x98autotelic\xE2\x80\x99 status she ascribes to tragic and other artforms goes beyond Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s own carefully nuanced position; the distinctive poetic standards of <i>Poetics</i> 25 are not entirely severed from those of \xE2\x80\x98life\xE2\x80\x99. Observe here the peculiar language used in Husain\xE2\x80\x99s claim that from an Aristotelian viewpoint \xE2\x80\x98a work of art\xE2\x80\xA6is a self-referential, self-significant, and self-worthy analogue of a living animal\xE2\x80\x99 (98, cf. 34). It would be hard to translate the compound adjectives in this proposition into Aristotelian terms: \xE2\x80\x98self-referential\xE2\x80\x99 in particular flatly contradicts the <i>Poetics</i>\xE2\x80\x99 notion of mimesis as the representation of \xE2\x80\x98life\xE2\x80\x99. Husain does not in the end escape her own tensions: all artworks, she thinks, form an \xE2\x80\x98<i>auto-telic</i> microcosm\xE2\x80\x99 (107, her italics), independent of anything \xE2\x80\x98extrinsic\xE2\x80\x99; but the idea of a microcosm requires that of a macrocosm. An Aristotelian aesthetics is rooted in the hope that art can help its audiences to comprehend the forms and possibilities of the human world a little better (<i>Poetics</i> chapter 4, never confronted by Husain) \xE2\x80\x93 a hope not to be equated with \xE2\x80\x98didacticism\xE2\x80\x99 or a \xE2\x80\x98mirror of life\xE2\x80\x99 model, contrary to Husain\xE2\x80\x99s briskly reductive depiction of readings different from her own (89-90).</p>   \n\
  <p>A common thread in the criticisms sketched above is the thought that Husain pursues her approach so single-mindedly (as well as, at times, with a damagingly selective deployment of textual evidence) that she ends up being more \xE2\x80\x98Aristotelian\xE2\x80\x99 than Aristotle himself. By insisting on the supposed purity of certain methodological and conceptual principles, she misses the realistic suppleness of thought that is just as vital to Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s cast of mind as any individual doctrine.</p>"
