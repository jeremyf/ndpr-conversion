content: "<p>This book contains eleven articles and includes works by some of the leading theorists in the field of practical rationality. It also contains an introduction (by editors Stroud and Tappolet) that succinctly summarizes the main themes, arguments, and concerns of the text. Despite much overlap and interconnectedness, the book\xE2\x80\x99s articles can be categorized in terms of three general strategies/aims of the contributing authors:</p>  <blockquote>(1) To illuminate the implications that akrasia (and other specific sorts of putative practical breakdown) have for general theories of practical rationality,</blockquote>  <blockquote>(2) To identify the mental entities and capacities we need to postulate in order to explain practical failures (and successes) like weakness (or strength) of will, and</blockquote>  <blockquote>(3) To clarify the nature of akrasia, etc., and explain how rifts between evaluation and motivation arise.</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>Contributions by Sara Stroud (Ch. 5, \xE2\x80\x9CWeakness of Will and Practical Judgement\xE2\x80\x9D), Sergio Tenenbaum (Ch. 6, \xE2\x80\x9CAccidie, Evaluation, and Motivation\xE2\x80\x9D), Gary Watson (Ch. 7, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Work of the Will\xE2\x80\x9D), Duncan MacIntosh (Ch. 9, \xE2\x80\x9CPrudence and the Temporal Structure of Practical Reasons\xE2\x80\x9D), and Ronald de Sousa (Ch. 11, \xE2\x80\x9CParadoxical Emotion: On <i>Sui Generis</i> Emotional Irrationality\xE2\x80\x9D) all fit into the first category. Stroud, Tenenbaum, and Watson individually conclude that, contrary to common opinion, occurrences of akrasia/accidie support internalism, the view that there is a necessary connection between practical judgments (i.e. judgments of the form \xE2\x80\x9C\xC3\xB8-ing would be the best course of action\xE2\x80\x9D) and intention/action. MacIntosh argues that a broadly Humean approach to practical rationality would, contrary to Thomas Nagel\xE2\x80\x99s assertions, promote coherence of attitudes over time. De Sousa considers examples of emotional antinomies, seemingly inconsistent clashes of attitudes, and concludes that our actual attitudes are the only arbiters of conflicts between practical and theoretical rationality.</p>  \n\
  <p>Articles by Richard Holton (Ch. 2, \xE2\x80\x9CHow is Strength of Will Possible?\xE2\x80\x9D), Christine Tappolet (Ch. 4, \xE2\x80\x9CEmotions and the Intelligibility of Akratic Action\xE2\x80\x9D), Gary Watson (Ch. 7, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Work of the Will\xE2\x80\x9D), and Joseph Heath (Ch. 10, \xE2\x80\x9CPractical Irrationality and Decision Theory\xE2\x80\x9D) fall into the second category. Holton argues we need to postulate more than just beliefs and desires, namely a distinct faculty of will power, in order to plausibly explain our capacity to remain resolute in the face of temptation. Tappolet contends that emotions, understood as attitudes that are irresponsive to higher-order cognitive faculties, offer the most promising explanation of akratic behavior. Watson offers an explanation of how internalists can distinguish between decision and practical assessment, despite the necessary link between the two, and thus accommodate a genuine conception of will within their framework. Heath, upon examining human tendencies in ultimatum games, suggests that standard decision theory, which casts agents\xE2\x80\x99 deliberations in a purely consequentialist light, should be revamped so as to more accurately reflect the deontological considerations that help produce our decisions under such circumstances; utility functions should be replaced with, what he calls, value functions.</p>  \n\
  <p>Papers by Michael Smith (Ch. 1, \xE2\x80\x9CRational Capacities, or: How to Distinguish Recklessness, Weakness, and Compulsion\xE2\x80\x9D) and Philip Pettit (Ch. 3, \xE2\x80\x9CAkrasia, Collective and Individual\xE2\x80\x9D) belong in the third category. Smith distinguishes weak-willed from compulsive behavior in terms of the capacity to form desires in accordance with one\xE2\x80\x99s practical judgments. Weak-willed agents have this capacity, compulsive agents don\xE2\x80\x99t. Then, Smith gives this capacity a possible-worlds analysis. Pettit attempts to clarify the nature of akrasia in the individual by examining how akratic behavior might arise in collectives of individuals.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ralph Wedgwood\xE2\x80\x99s article (Ch. 8, \xE2\x80\x9CChoosing Rationally and Choosing Correctly\xE2\x80\x9D) does not easily fit into any of the above categories. Nonetheless, he is concerned with a fundamental issue \xE2\x80\x93 the debate between recognitionalists and constructivists. \xE2\x80\x9CConstructivists believe that there are truths about what is a good thing for one to do because there are rational procedures for making choices\xE2\x80\x94whereas according to the recognitional view, there are rational procedures for making choices because there are truths about what is a good thing for one to do\xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D (209). Wedgwood considers the normative-question argument against recognitionalism - the idea that the view is deeply flawed because \xE2\x80\x9Cfor every substantive concept of a `good thing to do\xE2\x80\x99, one could always ask, without revealing any insanity or lack of intelligence, `But why should I always choose options that are good\xE2\x80\xA6 in that way?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9C (216). But such questions, according to the recognitional view, would seemingly indicate that the agent is irrational, beyond the power of rational persuasion altogether, because considerations of what is valuable are the only means of rational persuasion (213). In response, Wedgwood develops a formal (abstract) recognitional view that, he thinks, offers an adequate response to the normative question argument. He then turns the argument on the constructivists.</p>  \n\
  <p>In general, the book isolates many fundamental issues and arguments, and some authors, especially, de Sousa, Watson, Heath, and Tappolet effectively use relevant (and often perplexing or paradoxical) findings from empirical psychology to support their positions. The book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the nature of rational action.</p>  \n\
  <p>I would like to end my review with some specific evaluative considerations concerning Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s argument for internalism and McIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s broadly Humean view of rationality:</p>  \n\
  <p>The reality of akratic behavior, where the agent intentionally acts contrary to her own practical judgments, motivates Stroud to qualify her account of the connection between such judgments and intention/action. On her qualified view, the link between practical judgments and intention/action is necessary for those who are rational (137). This qualified view, thus, can accommodate akratic behavior.</p>  \n\
  <p>Then Stroud considers the \xE2\x80\x9Cpossibility\xE2\x80\x9D of global akrasia, where agents <i>always</i> fail to act in accordance with their practical judgments. Not only, she argues, is such a world possible, according to externalism, but also \xE2\x80\x9Cthese beings who are completely uninfluenced by the conclusions they reach about what they have most reason to do are still <i>practically rational agents</i>; they are simply rational agents with a different inventory of desires than is typical of human beings hereabouts\xE2\x80\x9D (144 \xE2\x80\x93 45). Internalists, on the other hand, might doubt the possibility of such a world and would certainly condemn such agents as hopelessly irrational. With regard, then, to their handlings of global akrasia, internalism is the more plausible view (145).</p>  \n\
  <p>I find Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s global akrasia argument somewhat compelling. Nonetheless, one has to wonder if the externalist might find a way to, as it were, sail between Skylla and Charybdis and offer an account according to which, while there is no necessary connection between practical judgments and the intentions/actions of rational agents, such global akrasia is not possible. Perhaps externalists could offer the following: A necessary condition for agency is that our practical judgments typically, or at least occasionally, (but not always) reflect what we desire (perhaps because, otherwise, we would be too schizophrenic to be classified as individuals). When our practical judgments accurately reflect our all-things-considered desires there is, even on the externalist view, a necessary connection between practical assessment and intention/action, for \xE2\x80\x9Cappropriate\xE2\x80\x9D intentions/actions would be instrumental to the satisfaction of those desires reflected in the assessments. If, for example, one\xE2\x80\x99s judgment that one should help those in dire need accurately reflected one\xE2\x80\x99s desire for the well-being of such individuals, then one would be rationally required, according to the externalist, to act in a helpful manner because so acting would be instrumental to the satisfaction of the underlying desire. However, in those cases where there is a rift between one\xE2\x80\x99s assessment and one\xE2\x80\x99s desires, there would be no necessary connection between practical assessment and action/intention, even for rational agents, for such actions and intentions would not be instrumental to the satisfaction of the agent\xE2\x80\x99s desires. On such a view global akrasia would not be possible. Beings who <i>always</i> suffered a schism between practical judgment and desire would not be agents; . <i>fortiori</i> they would not be rational agents.</p>  \n\
  <p>Not only would such an externalism offer a response to Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s global akrasia argument, it could seemingly handle \xE2\x80\x9Crational akrasia\xE2\x80\x9D better than Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s internalism. According to Audi (1990), Arpaly (2000), MacIntyre (1990), and Tappolet (115 \xE2\x80\x93 117), the possibility of rational akrasia presents itself when an agent\xE2\x80\x99s practical judgment does not reflect her (normative) reasons; perhaps the judgment fails to represent her overall desires and interests. MacIntyre uses the example of Huckleberry Finn, who fails, from concern for Jim\xE2\x80\x99s welfare, to act upon his practical judgment that he ought to return Jim to his \xE2\x80\x9Cowner.\xE2\x80\x9D Stroud would seemingly have to condemn Huckleberry Finn\xE2\x80\x99s action as irrational. Upon concluding what he ought to do, he is, on Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s view, rationally required to act in the \xE2\x80\x9Cappropriate\xE2\x80\x9D manner. But this would be exactly the sort of case where the externalist would deny a necessary connection between practical judgment and rational action/intention and allow for the rationality of Huckleberry\xE2\x80\x99s akratic behavior.</p>  \n\
  <p>Now, let\xE2\x80\x99s consider MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s Humean view of rationality. First, he uses examples of self-effacing reasons, i.e. cases in which desires rationally require their own renunciation because that is the best means to their satisfaction, to argue against Nagel\xE2\x80\x99s approach to practical rationality, which asserts that reasons are timeless and impersonal, i.e. \xE2\x80\x9Cthat something can be a reason for a given agent at one time just if it could be a reason for any agent any time\xE2\x80\x9D (231). Then MacIntosh develops his Humean approach to rational action: One\xE2\x80\x99s action is rational if and only if it is instrumental to the satisfaction of one\xE2\x80\x99s rational desires. Rational desires, on this view, are either those desires that are (broadly speaking) instrumental to the satisfaction of one\xE2\x80\x99s previous (rational) desires or one\xE2\x80\x99s original rational desires themselves. One\xE2\x80\x99s rational desires are either the same as one\xE2\x80\x99s earlier (rational) desires or they are \xE2\x80\x9Cfor things conducive to, entailed by, or partly constitutive of,\xE2\x80\x9D one\xE2\x80\x99s antecedent (rational) desires (236, also 238, 240, 242). All rational desires, then, are instrumentally justified, except one\xE2\x80\x99s original set: \xE2\x80\x9CI assume,\xE2\x80\x9D says MacIntosh, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe first set of values one ever holds counts as rationally permissible by virtue of there being no values one held previously with reference to which one\xE2\x80\x99s acquiring the first set was anti-maximizing. Thereafter any values are permissible just if forming them was not anti-maximizing on the values held just previously\xE2\x80\x9D (239, footnote 12). Ultimately, the rational status of one\xE2\x80\x99s current desires is determined by whether they are appropriately connected to one\xE2\x80\x99s original set.</p>  \n\
  <p>An advantage of MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s view is that it, contrary to traditional Humean instrumentalism, i.e. the view that all rational actions promote the satisfaction of one\xE2\x80\x99s current desires (whatever they may be), offers a response to Nagel\xE2\x80\x99s accusation that the Humean model allows for radical shifts in desire such that one\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Crational\xE2\x80\x9D actions might be absurdly incoherent over time. The fact that, on MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s view, new desires must be vetted by the old ensures some coherence of attitudes over time, at least for rational agents. A rather startling implication of MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s view\xE2\x80\x94one that he is willing to accept\xE2\x80\x94is that there is no general obligation/reason to be prudent, no reason to act now so as to promote the satisfaction of your future desires: \xE2\x80\x9CUnless one has a present aim to advance one\xE2\x80\x99s future aims, doing these things is irrational; only one\xE2\x80\x99s present aims can directly be one\xE2\x80\x99s reasons\xE2\x80\x9D (232).</p>  \n\
  <p>I share MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s skepticism of the view that all practical reasons are timeless and impersonal. Nonetheless, the idea that my current rational requirements are ultimately determined by the desires that I had at the dawn of my existence strikes me as hopelessly implausible. What about my desires for sexual gratification, to attend symphonic concerts, to acquire a better understanding of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory? It\xE2\x80\x99s certainly not clear that such desires are \xE2\x80\x9Cappropriately\xE2\x80\x9D related to the set of desires I had at, say, ages 4 or 5.</p>  \n\
  <p>MacIntosh explicitly addresses the advent of sexual desire: \xE2\x80\x9CWhile this change of preferences is not recommended, since it is anti-maximizing on one\xE2\x80\x99s prior preferences, neither is it forbidden, since that would violate the rule that, for it to be true that you (rationally) ought to do something, it must be true that you can do it. In puberty, you can\xE2\x80\x99t prevent the desire changes. So, they are merely non-rational; and, once they happen, one rationally must advance one\xE2\x80\x99s then preferences\xE2\x80\x9D (240, footnote 14). This won\xE2\x80\x99t do for a variety of reasons. First, it is not clear that the ought-implies-can rule applies to rationality. We call compulsive agents irrational despite the fact that they could not do otherwise. Second, just because one has a desire for sex does not mean that one has to act on that desire. The ought-implies-can principle, if it applies at all, exonerates only the desire for, not the pursuit of, sex. Further, in cases where one can resist acting upon non-rationally grounded desires, that is what MacIntosh recommends \xE2\x80\x9Cfor that is what would maximize on the value it is rational for [one] to hold\xE2\x80\x9D (239). Third, this view seems to imply that, if we could prevent the onset of sexual desire in a way that did not interfere with the satisfaction of other desires, we should do so.</p>  \n\
  <p>Those who are skeptical of the view that the same reasons apply to everyone, everywhere, and at all times would, I think, do well to reject MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s view in favor of a sophisticated constructivist account that can simultaneously avoid commitment to timeless and impersonal reasons, allow room for prudence as a duty, demand coherence of attitudes over time, and easily accommodate the rationality of desires of normal adults. The view that I favor is that one\xE2\x80\x99s reasons are determined by what one would value upon full information and rational reflection, where full-information includes, among other things, systematic non-manipulative exposure to possible sources of satisfaction. Such a view, I believe, could meet all of these objectives.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

  <p>Articles by Richard Holton (Ch. 2, \xE2\x80\x9CHow is Strength of Will Possible?\xE2\x80\x9D), Christine Tappolet (Ch. 4, \xE2\x80\x9CEmotions and the Intelligibility of Akratic Action\xE2\x80\x9D), Gary Watson (Ch. 7, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Work of the Will\xE2\x80\x9D), and Joseph Heath (Ch. 10, \xE2\x80\x9CPractical Irrationality and Decision Theory\xE2\x80\x9D) fall into the second category. Holton argues we need to postulate more than just beliefs and desires, namely a distinct faculty of will power, in order to plausibly explain our capacity to remain resolute in the face of temptation.

  <p>Papers by Michael Smith (Ch. 1, \xE2\x80\x9CRational Capacities, or: How to Distinguish Recklessness, Weakness, and Compulsion\xE2\x80\x9D) and Philip Pettit (Ch. 3, \xE2\x80\x9CAkrasia, Collective and Individual\xE2\x80\x9D) belong in the third category. Smith distinguishes weak-willed from compulsive behavior in terms of the capacity to form desires in accordance with one\xE2\x80\x99s practical judgments. Weak-willed agents have this capacity, compulsive agents don\xE2\x80\x99t. Then, Smith gives this capacity a possible-worlds analysis. Pettit attempts to clarify the nature of akrasia in the individual by examining how akratic behavior might arise in collectives of individuals.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ralph Wedgwood\xE2\x80\x99s article (Ch. 8, \xE2\x80\x9CChoosing Rationally and Choosing Correctly\xE2\x80\x9D) does not easily fit into any of the above categories. Nonetheless, he is concerned with a fundamental issue \xE2\x80\x93 the debate between recognitionalists and constructivists. \xE2\x80\x9CConstructivists believe that there are truths about what is a good thing for one to do because there are rational procedures for making choices\xE2\x80\x94whereas according to the recognitional view, there are rational procedures for making choices because there are truths about what is a good thing for one to do\xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D (209). Wedgwood considers the normative-question argument against recognitionalism - the idea that the view is deeply flawed because \xE2\x80\x9Cfor every substantive concept of a `good thing to do\xE2\x80\x99, one could always ask, without revealing any insanity or lack of intelligence, `But why should I always choose options that are good\xE2\x80\xA6 in that way?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9C (216). But such questions, according to the recognitional view, would seemingly indicate that the agent is irrational, beyond the power of rational persuasion altogether, because considerations of what is valuable are the only means of rational persuasion (213). In response, Wedgwood develops a formal (abstract) recognitional view that, he thinks, offers an adequate response to the normative question argument. He then turns the argument on the constructivists.</p>  \n\
  <p>In general, the book isolates many fundamental issues and arguments, and some authors, especially, de Sousa, Watson, Heath, and Tappolet effectively use relevant (and often perplexing or paradoxical) findings from empirical psychology to support their positions. The book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the nature of rational action.</p>  \n\
  <p>I would like to end my review with some specific evaluative considerations concerning Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s argument for internalism and McIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s broadly Humean view of rationality:</p>  \n\
  <p>The reality of akratic behavior, where the agent intentionally acts contrary to her own practical judgments, motivates Stroud to qualify her account of the connection between such judgments and intention/action. On her qualified view, the link between practical judgments and intention/action is necessary for those who are rational (137). This qualified view, thus, can accommodate akratic behavior.</p>  \n\
  <p>Then Stroud considers the \xE2\x80\x9Cpossibility\xE2\x80\x9D of global akrasia, where agents <i>always</i> fail to act in accordance with their practical judgments. Not only, she argues, is such a world possible, according to externalism, but also \xE2\x80\x9Cthese beings who are completely uninfluenced by the conclusions they reach about what they have most reason to do are still <i>practically rational agents</i>; they are simply rational agents with a different inventory of desires than is typical of human beings hereabouts\xE2\x80\x9D (144 \xE2\x80\x93 45). Internalists, on the other hand, might doubt the possibility of such a world and would certainly condemn such agents as hopelessly irrational. With regard, then, to their handlings of global akrasia, internalism is the more plausible view (145).</p>  \n\
  <p>I find Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s global akrasia argument somewhat compelling. Nonetheless, one has to wonder if the externalist might find a way to, as it were, sail between Skylla and Charybdis and offer an account according to which, while there is no necessary connection between practical judgments and the intentions/actions of rational agents, such global akrasia is not possible. Perhaps externalists could offer the following: A necessary condition for agency is that our practical judgments typically, or at least occasionally, (but not always) reflect what we desire (perhaps because, otherwise, we would be too schizophrenic to be classified as individuals). When our practical judgments accurately reflect our all-things-considered desires there is, even on the externalist view, a necessary connection between practical assessment and intention/action, for \xE2\x80\x9Cappropriate\xE2\x80\x9D intentions/actions would be instrumental to the satisfaction of those desires reflected in the assessments. If, for example, one\xE2\x80\x99s judgment that one should help those in dire need accurately reflected one\xE2\x80\x99s desire for the well-being of such individuals, then one would be rationally required, according to the externalist, to act in a helpful manner because so acting would be instrumental to the satisfaction of the underlying desire. However, in those cases where there is a rift between one\xE2\x80\x99s assessment and one\xE2\x80\x99s desires, there would be no necessary connection between practical assessment and action/intention, even for rational agents, for such actions and intentions would not be instrumental to the satisfaction of the agent\xE2\x80\x99s desires. On such a view global akrasia would not be possible. Beings who <i>always</i> suffered a schism between practical judgment and desire would not be agents; . <i>fortiori</i> they would not be rational agents.</p>  \n\
  <p>Not only would such an externalism offer a response to Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s global akrasia argument, it could seemingly handle \xE2\x80\x9Crational akrasia\xE2\x80\x9D better than Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s internalism. According to Audi (1990), Arpaly (2000), MacIntyre (1990), and Tappolet (115 \xE2\x80\x93 117), the possibility of rational akrasia presents itself when an agent\xE2\x80\x99s practical judgment does not reflect her (normative) reasons; perhaps the judgment fails to represent her overall desires and interests. MacIntyre uses the example of Huckleberry Finn, who fails, from concern for Jim\xE2\x80\x99s welfare, to act upon his practical judgment that he ought to return Jim to his \xE2\x80\x9Cowner.\xE2\x80\x9D Stroud would seemingly have to condemn Huckleberry Finn\xE2\x80\x99s action as irrational. Upon concluding what he ought to do, he is, on Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s view, rationally required to act in the \xE2\x80\x9Cappropriate\xE2\x80\x9D manner. But this would be exactly the sort of case where the externalist would deny a necessary connection between practical judgment and rational action/intention and allow for the rationality of Huckleberry\xE2\x80\x99s akratic behavior.</p>  \n\
  <p>Now, let\xE2\x80\x99s consider MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s Humean view of rationality. First, he uses examples of self-effacing reasons, i.e. cases in which desires rationally require their own renunciation because that is the best means to their satisfaction, to argue against Nagel\xE2\x80\x99s approach to practical rationality, which asserts that reasons are timeless and impersonal, i.e. \xE2\x80\x9Cthat something can be a reason for a given agent at one time just if it could be a reason for any agent any time\xE2\x80\x9D (231). Then MacIntosh develops his Humean approach to rational action: One\xE2\x80\x99s action is rational if and only if it is instrumental to the satisfaction of one\xE2\x80\x99s rational desires. Rational desires, on this view, are either those desires that are (broadly speaking) instrumental to the satisfaction of one\xE2\x80\x99s previous (rational) desires or one\xE2\x80\x99s original rational desires themselves. One\xE2\x80\x99s rational desires are either the same as one\xE2\x80\x99s earlier (rational) desires or they are \xE2\x80\x9Cfor things conducive to, entailed by, or partly constitutive of,\xE2\x80\x9D one\xE2\x80\x99s antecedent (rational) desires (236, also 238, 240, 242). All rational desires, then, are instrumentally justified, except one\xE2\x80\x99s original set: \xE2\x80\x9CI assume,\xE2\x80\x9D says MacIntosh, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe first set of values one ever holds counts as rationally permissible by virtue of there being no values one held previously with reference to which one\xE2\x80\x99s acquiring the first set was anti-maximizing. Thereafter any values are permissible just if forming them was not anti-maximizing on the values held just previously\xE2\x80\x9D (239, footnote 12). Ultimately, the rational status of one\xE2\x80\x99s current desires is determined by whether they are appropriately connected to one\xE2\x80\x99s original set.</p>  \n\
  <p>An advantage of MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s view is that it, contrary to traditional Humean instrumentalism, i.e. the view that all rational actions promote the satisfaction of one\xE2\x80\x99s current desires (whatever they may be), offers a response to Nagel\xE2\x80\x99s accusation that the Humean model allows for radical shifts in desire such that one\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Crational\xE2\x80\x9D actions might be absurdly incoherent over time. The fact that, on MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s view, new desires must be vetted by the old ensures some coherence of attitudes over time, at least for rational agents. A rather startling implication of MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s view\xE2\x80\x94one that he is willing to accept\xE2\x80\x94is that there is no general obligation/reason to be prudent, no reason to act now so as to promote the satisfaction of your future desires: \xE2\x80\x9CUnless one has a present aim to advance one\xE2\x80\x99s future aims, doing these things is irrational; only one\xE2\x80\x99s present aims can directly be one\xE2\x80\x99s reasons\xE2\x80\x9D (232).</p>  \n\
  <p>I share MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s skepticism of the view that all practical reasons are timeless and impersonal. Nonetheless, the idea that my current rational requirements are ultimately determined by the desires that I had at the dawn of my existence strikes me as hopelessly implausible. What about my desires for sexual gratification, to attend symphonic concerts, to acquire a better understanding of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory? It\xE2\x80\x99s certainly not clear that such desires are \xE2\x80\x9Cappropriately\xE2\x80\x9D related to the set of desires I had at, say, ages 4 or 5.</p>  \n\
  <p>MacIntosh explicitly addresses the advent of sexual desire: \xE2\x80\x9CWhile this change of preferences is not recommended, since it is anti-maximizing on one\xE2\x80\x99s prior preferences, neither is it forbidden, since that would violate the rule that, for it to be true that you (rationally) ought to do something, it must be true that you can do it. In puberty, you can\xE2\x80\x99t prevent the desire changes. So, they are merely non-rational; and, once they happen, one rationally must advance one\xE2\x80\x99s then preferences\xE2\x80\x9D (240, footnote 14). This won\xE2\x80\x99t do for a variety of reasons. First, it is not clear that the ought-implies-can rule applies to rationality. We call compulsive agents irrational despite the fact that they could not do otherwise. Second, just because one has a desire for sex does not mean that one has to act on that desire. The ought-implies-can principle, if it applies at all, exonerates only the desire for, not the pursuit of, sex. Further, in cases where one can resist acting upon non-rationally grounded desires, that is what MacIntosh recommends \xE2\x80\x9Cfor that is what would maximize on the value it is rational for [one] to hold\xE2\x80\x9D (239). Third, this view seems to imply that, if we could prevent the onset of sexual desire in a way that did not interfere with the satisfaction of other desires, we should do so.</p>  \n\
  <p>Those who are skeptical of the view that the same reasons apply to everyone, everywhere, and at all times would, I think, do well to reject MacIntosh\xE2\x80\x99s view in favor of a sophisticated constructivist account that can simultaneously avoid commitment to timeless and impersonal reasons, allow room for prudence as a duty, demand coherence of attitudes over time, and easily accommodate the rationality of desires of normal adults. The view that I favor is that one\xE2\x80\x99s reasons are determined by what one would value upon full information and rational reflection, where full-information includes, among other things, systematic non-manipulative exposure to possible sources of satisfaction. Such a view, I believe, could meet all of these objectives.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
