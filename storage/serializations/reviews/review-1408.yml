content: "<p>This collection of essays is a welcome addition to the growing body of literature on previously neglected aspects of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s thought. The \xE2\x80\x9Canthropology\xE2\x80\x9D referred to in the title encompasses not only Kant\xE2\x80\x99s late work <i>Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View</i> (1798), but, in addition, the lecture course upon which that work was based. Student notes from the latter have recently (in 1997) become available in a volume of the <i>Akademie</i> Edition of <i>Kants gesammelte Schriften</i>, the appearance of which provided the occasion for this collection of interpretive essays. The collection features original contributions by some of the leading Kant scholars writing today, including Reinhard Brandt and Werner Stark (the editors of the new volume in the <i>Akademie</i> edition), Allen Wood, Robert Louden, Paul Guyer, Howard Caygill, and Susan Meld Shell. The editors also each include their own essays. The essays cover a wide range of topics, relating Kant\xE2\x80\x99s anthropology to issues in his theoretical philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of history, and (especially) his practical philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>Kant began offering a lecture course on anthropology in the winter of 1772-3 that he repeated every winter semester until his retirement in 1796. The anthropology lectures, therefore, spanning as they do virtually the entire period in which Kant was developing his \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical system,\xE2\x80\x9D provide a potentially fascinating historical window into the development of his thought. What was the conception of anthropology that Kant developed in these lectures? As the editors point out in their useful introduction to the collection, anthropology as conceived by Kant was a broad-based inquiry into the nature of human beings in general (p. 3). It was also conceived as a discipline that was <i>empirical</i> and <i>pragmatic.</i> It was to be completely divorced from metaphysical speculation, based instead upon observations of ordinary life (whether first-hand or through literature, travel accounts, histories, etc.). It was also to be <i>useful</i>, providing the kind of \xE2\x80\x9Cworldly wisdom\xE2\x80\x9D that would allow one to get ahead in life, to successfully pursue happiness. As actually practiced by Kant in his lectures and subsequent book, anthropology involved a consideration of the faculties of the human mind in general (i.e., cognition, pleasure/ displeasure, and desire), of the \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacters\xE2\x80\x9D of various sub-sections of humanity (the two sexes, the different nations and races), and of the \xE2\x80\x9Cdestiny\xE2\x80\x9D [<i>Bestimmung</i>] of humanity as a whole. In line with its empirical method and practical orientation, Kant\xE2\x80\x99s tone throughout his anthropological writings is more engaging and popular, less technical and rigorous than in his better-known works. At the same time, in his anthropology, Kant deals with some of the same themes and concepts of his critical philosophy, such as self-consciousness, taste, and the highest good. Does this mean that we should take the anthropology to be mainly a popularization of the (developing) critical system? Or does it, on the contrary, have a systematic importance in its own right? In favor of the latter view, one might point to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s enigmatic references in the <i>Groundwork</i> (and elsewhere) to an \xE2\x80\x9Cempirical part\xE2\x80\x9D of moral philosophy, called \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical anthropology,\xE2\x80\x9D which would deal with \xE2\x80\x9Claws of the human being\xE2\x80\x99s will insofar as it is affected by nature\xE2\x80\x9D (4: 387-8; 1). This, of course, is to be the supplement to (and carefully separated from) the primary, \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Crational\xE2\x80\x9D part of moral philosophy, the metaphysics of morals. Whereas \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D deals with how human beings <i>actually</i> behave, the metaphysics of morals deals with how they <i>ought</i> to behave. Nevertheless, Kant seems to suggest, practical anthropology is required to provide \xE2\x80\x9Capplicability\xE2\x80\x9D to the a priori laws of morality, in order to make these laws \xE2\x80\x9Ceffective <i>in concreto</i> in the conduct of [one\xE2\x80\x99s] life\xE2\x80\x9D (4: 389; 3). Is this \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D what Kant intends to provide in the anthropology lectures? If so, do these lectures (and the resultant book) <i>actually</i> provide an essential supplement to the purely rational part of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory? These are among the most interesting puzzles that have arisen in connection with Kant\xE2\x80\x99s anthropology.</p>  \n\
  <p>The interpretive essays in this collection consider a wide range of questions about Kant\xE2\x80\x99s anthropology. They fall into two broad groups: those dealing with more \xE2\x80\x9Chistorical,\xE2\x80\x9D and those dealing with more \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophical\xE2\x80\x9D issues. Several of the essays deal primarily with the ways in which the anthropology lectures illuminate the origin and evolution of key aspects of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy. This group includes the essays by Stark, Guyer, Caygill, and Shell. In his contribution, Werner Stark usefully provides historical background regarding the academic and intellectual context in which the lectures emerged. Stark connects the emergence of the anthropology to the emergence of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s conception of a \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D moral philosophy. He finds it particularly suggestive that Kant typically paired his anthropology lectures with his <i>ethics</i> lectures (giving them both in the same semester). According to Stark, this pairing indicates a reciprocal relationship between anthropology and ethics, such that \xE2\x80\x9Cneither can be thought independently of the other\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 25). Here Stark has in mind the relation between the \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cempirical\xE2\x80\x9D parts of moral philosophy discussed above. He cites evidence from the lectures of mid-1770\xE2\x80\x99s that show that even there, Kant insisted upon a reciprocal relationship between ethics and anthropology. Somewhat disappointingly, however, Stark does not pursue the more philosophical questions of what this reciprocity <i>actually entailed,</i> or whether Kant was <i>entitled</i> to assert such a connection.</p>  \n\
  <p>Paul Guyer recounts how the anthropology lectures provide new evidence about the development of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetic theory. What these lectures show, Guyer argues, is that most of the characteristic elements of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s mature aesthetic theory were already present in early versions of the lectures. The key element that was missing, and only provided in the <i>Critique of Judgment</i> itself, is the connection between aesthetics and <i>teleology.</i> This essay provides additional historical support for a thesis that Guyer has worked out in his previous writings on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics: that the aesthetic can provide support for the moral only if it is independently conceived (or \xE2\x80\x9Cautonomous\xE2\x80\x9D).</p>  \n\
  <p>Howard Caygill provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of the development of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theoretical philosophy. He argues that the anthropology course was the principal place where Kant worked out his novel doctrine of <i>sensibility</i> (as a unique faculty of the mind). In particular, it was primarily in the anthropology lectures that Kant worked out his <i>defense</i> of sensibility against rationalist objections (such as the objection that the senses served only to confuse the understanding). Caygill evidently believes that the theory of sensibility is the key innovation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical period,\xE2\x80\x9D but he does not really argue for that point here. He does, however, carefully trace the steps by which Kant separated his view from that of his rationalist predecessors.</p>  \n\
  <p>Finally, Susan Meld Shell traces the evolution of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s conception of <i>happiness,</i> as this is reflected in the anthropology lectures. Her basic thesis is that the lectures document a turning-point in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s conception of happiness, caused by his reading of Pietro Verri\xE2\x80\x99s <i>del piacere e del dolere,</i> which convinced him that human life necessarily involves more pain than pleasure. This encounter with Verri made Kant shift to a more pessimistic conception of human life and a sterner view of what type of happiness is achievable by human beings. Needless to say, Verri\xE2\x80\x99s thesis is highly controversial, and one might wish for more discussion of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s reasons for adopting it than Shell provides here. Nevertheless, she does present a well-documented case for her historical thesis.</p>  \n\
  <p>While the predominantly historical essays will be interesting for specialists in the various areas of Kant scholarship, a perhaps more intriguing question for philosophers with a more general interest in Kant is whether the newly published anthropology lectures in any way force a <i>reassessment</i> of key aspects of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy. The best cases for and against such a conclusion are made in essays dealing with aspects of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s <i>practical</i> philosophy, including those by Wood, Jacobs, Kain, Brandt, and Louden. Allen Wood disputes the view, put forth by Alasdair MacIntyre among others, that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s only conception of human nature is one that involves (quoting MacIntyre) \xE2\x80\x9Cthe physiological and non-rational side of man\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 42). It is natural, Wood admits, to think that Kant must regard (empirical) anthropology as a mechanistic natural science that excludes freedom (p. 43). This certainly seems to follow from Kant\xE2\x80\x99s view of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe empirical world of nature as a strictly deterministic causal mechanism, in which no free agency could be found\xE2\x80\x9D (ibid.). However, Wood argues that this conclusion ignores the fact that for Kant, \xE2\x80\x9Cour only coherent conception of ourselves, as moral agents or even as subjects of theoretical judgment, is one which presupposes from a practical standpoint that we are free\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 44). Wood holds that, because of this, Kant\xE2\x80\x99s empirical anthropology also \xE2\x80\x9Cinterprets the empirical observations that it makes on the basis of [the presupposition that human beings are free]\xE2\x80\x9D (ibid.). The \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatic\xE2\x80\x9D character of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s anthropology, then, also refers to the fact that it deals with human nature as something that is at least in part the product of free agency. If Wood is correct about this Kant, in his anthropological thought, self-consciously <i>blurs</i> his famous distinction between the \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo standpoints\xE2\x80\x9D: a theoretical standpoint from which we regard ourselves as thoroughly determined by mechanical causes and a practical standpoint from which we regard ourselves as self-determining agents. Wood proposes that, in his anthropology, Kant adopts a hybrid of these two standpoints: a <i>theoretical</i> standpoint from which we regard ourselves as <i>autonomous.</i></p>  \n\
  <p>Two questions immediately arise in connection with Wood\xE2\x80\x99s intriguing proposal. First, is Kant\xE2\x80\x99s methodological presupposition in the anthropology <i>in fact</i> as Wood describes? Second, is this presupposition <i>legitimate</i>, given the strictures imposed by the critical philosophy? Wood seems to believe that it <i>is</i> legitimate, but one could raise doubts about this. As regards the first question, it is hard to dispute Wood\xE2\x80\x99s point. First of all, Kant introduces anthropology in the published work as a body of knowledge which aims at \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat man makes, can, or should make of himself as a <i>freely</i> acting being\xE2\x80\x9D (7: 119; 3 [emphasis added]). Moreover, the <i>actual</i> orientation of the anthropology towards practical, \xE2\x80\x9Cworldly\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge supports this characterization of it, and hence does indeed suggest that it is an inquiry based on the presupposition of human freedom. It is less obvious, however, that Kant is <i>entitled</i> to this assumption. Shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t any properly <i>empirical</i> inquiry for Kant be based upon an investigation of efficient (mechanical) causes? How is Kant\xE2\x80\x99s apparent procedure in the anthropology consistent with his claims in the <i>Critiques</i> that, in principle at least, the conduct of a human being is just as predicable as the occurrence of \xE2\x80\x9Ca solar or lunar eclipse\xE2\x80\x9D (5:99; 83)? If this claim about predictability is true, what is the point of regarding human beings as free when we are <i>observing</i> them (from the empirical perspective)? Wood\xE2\x80\x99s reply is based on the presupposition that Kant is fundamentally skeptical about the prospects of a predictive science of human behavior. Wood argues that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claims about predictability, such as the one cited above, express merely \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical propositions\xE2\x80\x9D that \xE2\x80\x9Cdo not indicate anything about any possible program of empirical research into human actions\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 44). Kant, on Wood\xE2\x80\x99s view, ruled out <i>a</i> <i>priori</i> the possibility that there could be a predictive science of human behavior analogous to the science of mechanics. So the predictability Kant is talking about in the above passage must remain forever \xE2\x80\x9Cin principle\xE2\x80\x9D predictability. Why did Kant think this? According to Wood, there are several reasons. First, Kant denied that it was possible to explain the connection between the corporeal and the mental, hence \xE2\x80\x9Cany mechanistic laws governing acts of the mind would have to involve a psychological determinism cut off from the causality of objects of outer sense\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 45). Second, our consciousness of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe appearances of inner sense\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 especially of our own motives \xE2\x80\x93 is characterized by a lack of certainly and self-deception (p. 45). Finally, we cannot tell what persons\xE2\x80\x99 underlying principles of action are by observing their (habitual) behavior, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor any habit is consistent with a variety of traits or dispositions\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 48). This would be an obstacle to forming reliable generalizations about human behavior because we could not predict from observing what people habitually do how they would behave in novel or unusual situations.</p>  \n\
  <p>Wood puts forth a very convincing textual case for ascribing this view to Kant. He evidently also believes that the position he attributes to Kant is a sound one. Is he right about this? Certainly, if one assumes that (1) we require, for practical purposes, a working knowledge of how human beings usually behave, yet (2) the mechanical model of human behavior cannot provide this, then it does indeed seem reasonable to conclude that we need to adopt some other model. Since the only available alternative is the model that considers human beings as free rational agents, we need to adopt this model for the empirical study of human beings. Assumption (1) above can hardly be disputed. But how can we be so sure that assumption (2) is the right one? One might think that the Kant emphasized by Wood is excessively \xE2\x80\x9Cdefeatist\xE2\x80\x9D about the prospects of a mechanistic empirical psychology. At any rate, the reasons Wood cites do not seem to me to actually rule out the possibility that there could (someday) be a predictive science of human behavior analogous to the science of mechanics. To begin with, it is unclear why solving the mind-body problem should be a condition of a predictive science of human <i>behavior.</i> One would think that such a science could remain wholly on the level of outer appearances, and disregard the inner, \xE2\x80\x9Cmental\xE2\x80\x9D side of the picture altogether. For the same reason, the uncertainty and deceptiveness characteristic of our awareness of our own motives would be irrelevant to a mechanistic behavioral science. The motives would not matter, as long as we could accurately predict the behavior that resulted from them. Nor does the last reason Wood gives seem entirely convincing to me. The problem of predicting how a person would behave in unusual situations from how they behave in familiar ones is a real issue, but there is no reason to believe it is unsolvable. For one thing, we can rely on observations of how <i>other</i> people with similar habits have behaved when confronted with a certain situation. Of course, due to the inherent complexity of the phenomena, we should expect that our ability to predict will probably always be less than perfect. Nevertheless, I cannot see why the possibility of a highly reliable predictive science of human behavior should be ruled out <i>a</i> <i>priori</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>Wood does, however, at least raise the interesting possibility that there is room in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s thought for a \xE2\x80\x9Cthird standpoint\xE2\x80\x9D that unites the theoretical and the practical. In the most philosophically interesting part of his contribution, Brian Jacobs develops this idea with his suggestion that the solution to the problem of finding a basis for the unification of the physiological and practical perspectives on the human being is to be found in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s anthropological conception of \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacter.\xE2\x80\x9D As Jacobs understands it, this conception of character possesses an ambiguity that particularly suits it for being a bridge between the natural and the moral conceptions of the human being. As he puts it, for Kant, \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacter ought to reveal both the basic psychological constitution of the person and the unmistakable traces of an intelligibly autonomous self\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 120). The term \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacter\xE2\x80\x9D refers to both the observable behavior of a person and a moral property \xE2\x80\x93 the person\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cway of thinking\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 that is not and never can be observed. The link between these two senses of the term is the fact that the observable behavior \xE2\x80\x9Cstands in for\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 we might say <i>expresses \xE2\x80\x93</i> the moral property. Mysterious as this notion is, it is congruent with what Kant says about beauty \xE2\x80\x9Csymbolizing\xE2\x80\x9D morality in the <i>Critique of Judgment</i>. Nevertheless, as Jacobs points out, \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacterization\xE2\x80\x9D for Kant must be distinguished from symbolization, insofar as only in the case of the latter function does the observed <i>resemble</i> the unobserved. If this is correct, then Kant operated with two <i>distinct</i> conceptions of ways in which the empirical phenomena could \xE2\x80\x9Cexpress\xE2\x80\x9D the purely intelligible.</p>  \n\
  <p>Patrick Kain, like Wood, contests what he sees as a widespread misconception about Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral psychology. In Kain\xE2\x80\x99s case, this is the view held by some contemporary Kantians that Kant does not (and perhaps cannot) provide any independent account of the normativity of prudential reason. Kain suggests that such an account might be based upon Kant\xE2\x80\x99s idea that one\xE2\x80\x99s own happiness or well-being is a \xE2\x80\x9Cnecessary end\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 250). This might explain, he thinks, why Kant believes that there is something irrational about pursuing a particular end or object that is in conflict with one\xE2\x80\x99s clear overall well-being; in the face of such a conflict, it only makes sense to give up the only end one <i>can</i> give up, namely, the <i>particular</i> end (Ibid.). As Kain recognizes, however, this entire line of argument depends upon establishing that happiness is in fact a necessary end. And this is a notion, as several commentators have recognized, which is very difficult to reconcile with central doctrines of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory, such as his view that the free will chooses its own ends.</p>  \n\
  <p>In addition to these questions about Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral psychology, there is the previously discussed question how we are to understand the relation of the anthropology writings to the critical system. Several of the authors touch on this question in one way or another, but it is Reinhard Brandt and Robert Louden who most clearly offer opposing estimations of the systematic importance of the anthropology. Brandt is convinced that pragmatic anthropology \xE2\x80\x9Cneither belongs to philosophy in a strict sense, nor is it articulated as a system based upon an idea of reason\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 85). In support of this claim, Brandt first argues that there is no obvious conceptual link between the two main divisions of the <i>Anthropology,</i> the \xE2\x80\x9Cdidactic\xE2\x80\x9D and the \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacteristic\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 89). Whatever unity is to be found here is, according to Brandt, something that developed only gradually and in stages, as Kant groped, in successive versions of the lectures, towards a progressively more complete presentation of a \xE2\x80\x9Cdoctrine of prudence\xE2\x80\x9D (the knowledge necessary for the successful pursuit of happiness in the world) (p. 91). Because of this basic orientation towards <i>prudential</i> (hence self-interested) action, Brandt concludes that \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatic anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D is fundamentally limited in its aims and hence cannot be identified with the discipline of practical anthropology that Kant claimed was the necessary complement to pure moral philosophy (p. 92). Finally, pragmatic anthropology is not properly philosophical, since it lacks an . <i>priori</i> dimension; even its discussion of the destiny or vocation [<i>Bestimmung</i>] of the human race \xE2\x80\x9Cis analyzed entirely empirically and as immanent to the world\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 93). We may thus view Brandt as laying down a challenge (and laying out some of the obstacles) to anyone who would claim to find in the anthropology an indispensable part of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s system of moral philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>This challenge is taken up by Robert Louden. Louden concedes that \xE2\x80\x9CKant nowhere (i.e., neither in the anthropology lectures nor anywhere else) hands over to his readers a single, complete, tidy package of moral anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 64). But rather than be daunted by this, Louden attempts to provide a <i>reconstruction</i> of the promised second, empirical part of moral philosophy from the material that Kant <i>does</i> provide. As against Brandt, Louden tries to show that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s pragmatic anthropology does indeed have both a properly <i>moral</i> (as opposed to a merely prudential), as well as an . <i>priori</i> dimension. According to Louden, the \xE2\x80\x9Coverarching goal\xE2\x80\x9D of the anthropology writings \xE2\x80\x9Cis to figure out what human nature is like in order more effectively to further moral ends\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 69). In order to do this, anthropology must of course provide accurate empirical knowledge, but it is not at all a \xE2\x80\x9CWeberian value-free undertaking\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 79). Rather, it is a mode of empirical inquiry framed by the <i>a</i> <i>priori</i> assumption that human beings are morally free and are destined to realize their freedom through the emergence of a \xE2\x80\x9Ccosmopolitan society\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 73). The descriptions of human beings that anthropology provides are intended to help realize this goal.</p>  \n\
  <p>Through his detailed scholarship, Louden does a commendable job of reconstructing a plausibly Kantian moral anthropology that overcomes some of Brandt\xE2\x80\x99s skeptical obstacles. However, there is another question that needs to be asked: does this reconstructed anthropology really constitute an <i>essential</i> supplement to the purely rational part of moral philosophy? Is it an indispensable part of the system of philosophy itself? Louden evidently endorses Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claim that moral philosophy \xE2\x80\x9Cneeds anthropology for its <i>application</i> to human beings\xE2\x80\x9D (4:412; 23). This is, however, a puzzling claim if we have in mind the famous examples of moral reasoning that Kant provides in the <i>Groundwork</i> and the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>. There the pure moral law (the categorical imperative) seems quite adequate all by itself for providing us with determinate answers to moral questions. Consider a question like \xE2\x80\x9CShould I make a false promise in order to obtain some ready cash?\xE2\x80\x9D The moral law, of course, answers this question in the negative. Anthropological knowledge is not obviously needed in order to translate this answer \xE2\x80\x9Cinto human terms\xE2\x80\x9D before it can be applied to my situation. The answer given by pure rational moral philosophy is already immediately applicable as it stands. So here is evidently a situation in which anthropology is <i>not</i> needed for the application of moral philosophy to human beings. But this is not just <i>any</i> situation; it is the <i>typical</i> situation for Kant. So what was Kant thinking when he made his remarks about the need for anthropology in order to make moral philosophy applicable to human beings? One possible answer is that Kant was thinking primarily of <i>moral education</i> here. Anthropological knowledge is necessary in order to educate human beings morally, to \xE2\x80\x9Cawaken their reason\xE2\x80\x9D and arouse their consciousness of the moral law that binds them. This interpretation is supported by passages like one cited by Louden himself, in which Kant explains why \xE2\x80\x9Cmorals must be united with knowledge of humanity\xE2\x80\x9D in the following terms: \xE2\x80\x9CThe reason that morals <i>and sermons \xE2\x80\xA6</i> have little effect is due to the lack of knowledge of the human being\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 66, quoting 25: 471-2, my emphasis). In other words, Kant is saying that merely moralizing and sermonizing is ineffective as a means of moral education if one lacks adequate knowledge of the specific cognitive capacities and motivations of human beings. One must know how to effectively awaken and elicit the inborn moral consciousness of human beings, and this requires a general \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatic\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge of their capacities and motives. But here we are talking about the essentially empirical methods of practical pedagogy, which should not be considered a part of moral philosophy proper. Anthropology, in other words, stands outside the system of philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p><i>Essays on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s Anthropology</i> is a valuable collection of contemporary essays on a generally overlooked dimension of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s thought.

  <p>Kant began offering a lecture course on anthropology in the winter of 1772-3 that he repeated every winter semester until his retirement in 1796. The anthropology lectures, therefore, spanning as they do virtually the entire period in which Kant was developing his \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical system,\xE2\x80\x9D provide a potentially fascinating historical window into the development of his thought. What was the conception of anthropology that Kant developed in these lectures? As the editors point out in their useful introduction to the collection, anthropology as conceived by Kant was a broad-based inquiry into the nature of human beings in general (p. 3). It was also conceived as a discipline that was <i>empirical</i> and <i>pragmatic.</i> It was to be completely divorced from metaphysical speculation, based instead upon observations of ordinary life (whether first-hand or through literature, travel accounts, histories, etc.). It was also to be <i>useful</i>, providing the kind of \xE2\x80\x9Cworldly wisdom\xE2\x80\x9D that would allow one to get ahead in life, to successfully pursue happiness. As actually practiced by Kant in his lectures and subsequent book, anthropology involved a consideration of the faculties of the human mind in general (i.e., cognition, pleasure/ displeasure, and desire), of the \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacters\xE2\x80\x9D of various sub-sections of humanity (the two sexes, the different nations and races), and of the \xE2\x80\x9Cdestiny\xE2\x80\x9D [<i>Bestimmung</i>] of humanity as a whole. In line with its empirical method and practical orientation, Kant\xE2\x80\x99s tone throughout his anthropological writings is more engaging and popular, less technical and rigorous than in his better-known works. At the same time, in his anthropology, Kant deals with some of the same themes and concepts of his critical philosophy, such as self-consciousness, taste, and the highest good. Does this mean that we should take the anthropology to be mainly a popularization of the (developing) critical system? Or does it, on the contrary, have a systematic importance in its own right? In favor of the latter view, one might point to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s enigmatic references in the <i>Groundwork</i> (and elsewhere) to an \xE2\x80\x9Cempirical part\xE2\x80\x9D of moral philosophy, called \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical anthropology,\xE2\x80\x9D which would deal with \xE2\x80\x9Claws of the human being\xE2\x80\x99s will insofar as it is affected by nature\xE2\x80\x9D (4: 387-8; 1). This, of course, is to be the supplement to (and carefully separated from) the primary, \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Crational\xE2\x80\x9D part of moral philosophy, the metaphysics of morals. Whereas \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D deals with how human beings <i>actually</i> behave, the metaphysics of morals deals with how they <i>ought</i> to behave. Nevertheless, Kant seems to suggest, practical anthropology is required to provide \xE2\x80\x9Capplicability\xE2\x80\x9D to the a priori laws of morality, in order to make these laws \xE2\x80\x9Ceffective <i>in concreto</i> in the conduct of [one\xE2\x80\x99s] life\xE2\x80\x9D (4: 389; 3). Is this \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D what Kant intends to provide in the anthropology lectures? If so, do these lectures (and the resultant book) <i>actually</i> provide an essential supplement to the purely rational part of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory? These are among the most interesting puzzles that have arisen in connection with Kant\xE2\x80\x99s anthropology.</p>  \n\
  <p>The interpretive essays in this collection consider a wide range of questions about Kant\xE2\x80\x99s anthropology. They fall into two broad groups: those dealing with more \xE2\x80\x9Chistorical,\xE2\x80\x9D and those dealing with more \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophical\xE2\x80\x9D issues. Several of the essays deal primarily with the ways in which the anthropology lectures illuminate the origin and evolution of key aspects of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy. This group includes the essays by Stark, Guyer, Caygill, and Shell. In his contribution, Werner Stark usefully provides historical background regarding the academic and intellectual context in which the lectures emerged. Stark connects the emergence of the anthropology to the emergence of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s conception of a \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D moral philosophy. He finds it particularly suggestive that Kant typically paired his anthropology lectures with his <i>ethics</i> lectures (giving them both in the same semester). According to Stark, this pairing indicates a reciprocal relationship between anthropology and ethics, such that \xE2\x80\x9Cneither can be thought independently of the other\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 25). Here Stark has in mind the relation between the \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cempirical\xE2\x80\x9D parts of moral philosophy discussed above. He cites evidence from the lectures of mid-1770\xE2\x80\x99s that show that even there, Kant insisted upon a reciprocal relationship between ethics and anthropology. Somewhat disappointingly, however, Stark does not pursue the more philosophical questions of what this reciprocity <i>actually entailed,</i> or whether Kant was <i>entitled</i> to assert such a connection.</p>  \n\
  <p>Paul Guyer recounts how the anthropology lectures provide new evidence about the development of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetic theory. What these lectures show, Guyer argues, is that most of the characteristic elements of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s mature aesthetic theory were already present in early versions of the lectures. The key element that was missing, and only provided in the <i>Critique of Judgment</i> itself, is the connection between aesthetics and <i>teleology.</i> This essay provides additional historical support for a thesis that Guyer has worked out in his previous writings on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics: that the aesthetic can provide support for the moral only if it is independently conceived (or \xE2\x80\x9Cautonomous\xE2\x80\x9D).</p>  \n\
  <p>Howard Caygill provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of the development of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theoretical philosophy. He argues that the anthropology course was the principal place where Kant worked out his novel doctrine of <i>sensibility</i> (as a unique faculty of the mind). In particular, it was primarily in the anthropology lectures that Kant worked out his <i>defense</i> of sensibility against rationalist objections (such as the objection that the senses served only to confuse the understanding). Caygill evidently believes that the theory of sensibility is the key innovation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical period,\xE2\x80\x9D but he does not really argue for that point here. He does, however, carefully trace the steps by which Kant separated his view from that of his rationalist predecessors.</p>  \n\
  <p>Finally, Susan Meld Shell traces the evolution of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s conception of <i>happiness,</i> as this is reflected in the anthropology lectures. Her basic thesis is that the lectures document a turning-point in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s conception of happiness, caused by his reading of Pietro Verri\xE2\x80\x99s <i>del piacere e del dolere,</i> which convinced him that human life necessarily involves more pain than pleasure. This encounter with Verri made Kant shift to a more pessimistic conception of human life and a sterner view of what type of happiness is achievable by human beings. Needless to say, Verri\xE2\x80\x99s thesis is highly controversial, and one might wish for more discussion of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s reasons for adopting it than Shell provides here. Nevertheless, she does present a well-documented case for her historical thesis.</p>  \n\
  <p>While the predominantly historical essays will be interesting for specialists in the various areas of Kant scholarship, a perhaps more intriguing question for philosophers with a more general interest in Kant is whether the newly published anthropology lectures in any way force a <i>reassessment</i> of key aspects of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy. The best cases for and against such a conclusion are made in essays dealing with aspects of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s <i>practical</i> philosophy, including those by Wood, Jacobs, Kain, Brandt, and Louden. Allen Wood disputes the view, put forth by Alasdair MacIntyre among others, that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s only conception of human nature is one that involves (quoting MacIntyre) \xE2\x80\x9Cthe physiological and non-rational side of man\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 42). It is natural, Wood admits, to think that Kant must regard (empirical) anthropology as a mechanistic natural science that excludes freedom (p. 43). This certainly seems to follow from Kant\xE2\x80\x99s view of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe empirical world of nature as a strictly deterministic causal mechanism, in which no free agency could be found\xE2\x80\x9D (ibid.). However, Wood argues that this conclusion ignores the fact that for Kant, \xE2\x80\x9Cour only coherent conception of ourselves, as moral agents or even as subjects of theoretical judgment, is one which presupposes from a practical standpoint that we are free\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 44). Wood holds that, because of this, Kant\xE2\x80\x99s empirical anthropology also \xE2\x80\x9Cinterprets the empirical observations that it makes on the basis of [the presupposition that human beings are free]\xE2\x80\x9D (ibid.). The \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatic\xE2\x80\x9D character of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s anthropology, then, also refers to the fact that it deals with human nature as something that is at least in part the product of free agency. If Wood is correct about this Kant, in his anthropological thought, self-consciously <i>blurs</i> his famous distinction between the \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo standpoints\xE2\x80\x9D: a theoretical standpoint from which we regard ourselves as thoroughly determined by mechanical causes and a practical standpoint from which we regard ourselves as self-determining agents. Wood proposes that, in his anthropology, Kant adopts a hybrid of these two standpoints: a <i>theoretical</i> standpoint from which we regard ourselves as <i>autonomous.</i></p>  \n\
  <p>Two questions immediately arise in connection with Wood\xE2\x80\x99s intriguing proposal. First, is Kant\xE2\x80\x99s methodological presupposition in the anthropology <i>in fact</i> as Wood describes? Second, is this presupposition <i>legitimate</i>, given the strictures imposed by the critical philosophy? Wood seems to believe that it <i>is</i> legitimate, but one could raise doubts about this. As regards the first question, it is hard to dispute Wood\xE2\x80\x99s point. First of all, Kant introduces anthropology in the published work as a body of knowledge which aims at \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat man makes, can, or should make of himself as a <i>freely</i> acting being\xE2\x80\x9D (7: 119; 3 [emphasis added]). Moreover, the <i>actual</i> orientation of the anthropology towards practical, \xE2\x80\x9Cworldly\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge supports this characterization of it, and hence does indeed suggest that it is an inquiry based on the presupposition of human freedom. It is less obvious, however, that Kant is <i>entitled</i> to this assumption. Shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t any properly <i>empirical</i> inquiry for Kant be based upon an investigation of efficient (mechanical) causes? How is Kant\xE2\x80\x99s apparent procedure in the anthropology consistent with his claims in the <i>Critiques</i> that, in principle at least, the conduct of a human being is just as predicable as the occurrence of \xE2\x80\x9Ca solar or lunar eclipse\xE2\x80\x9D (5:99; 83)? If this claim about predictability is true, what is the point of regarding human beings as free when we are <i>observing</i> them (from the empirical perspective)? Wood\xE2\x80\x99s reply is based on the presupposition that Kant is fundamentally skeptical about the prospects of a predictive science of human behavior. Wood argues that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claims about predictability, such as the one cited above, express merely \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical propositions\xE2\x80\x9D that \xE2\x80\x9Cdo not indicate anything about any possible program of empirical research into human actions\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 44). Kant, on Wood\xE2\x80\x99s view, ruled out <i>a</i> <i>priori</i> the possibility that there could be a predictive science of human behavior analogous to the science of mechanics. So the predictability Kant is talking about in the above passage must remain forever \xE2\x80\x9Cin principle\xE2\x80\x9D predictability. Why did Kant think this? According to Wood, there are several reasons. First, Kant denied that it was possible to explain the connection between the corporeal and the mental, hence \xE2\x80\x9Cany mechanistic laws governing acts of the mind would have to involve a psychological determinism cut off from the causality of objects of outer sense\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 45). Second, our consciousness of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe appearances of inner sense\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 especially of our own motives \xE2\x80\x93 is characterized by a lack of certainly and self-deception (p. 45). Finally, we cannot tell what persons\xE2\x80\x99 underlying principles of action are by observing their (habitual) behavior, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor any habit is consistent with a variety of traits or dispositions\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 48). This would be an obstacle to forming reliable generalizations about human behavior because we could not predict from observing what people habitually do how they would behave in novel or unusual situations.</p>  \n\
  <p>Wood puts forth a very convincing textual case for ascribing this view to Kant. He evidently also believes that the position he attributes to Kant is a sound one. Is he right about this? Certainly, if one assumes that (1) we require, for practical purposes, a working knowledge of how human beings usually behave, yet (2) the mechanical model of human behavior cannot provide this, then it does indeed seem reasonable to conclude that we need to adopt some other model. Since the only available alternative is the model that considers human beings as free rational agents, we need to adopt this model for the empirical study of human beings. Assumption (1) above can hardly be disputed. But how can we be so sure that assumption (2) is the right one? One might think that the Kant emphasized by Wood is excessively \xE2\x80\x9Cdefeatist\xE2\x80\x9D about the prospects of a mechanistic empirical psychology. At any rate, the reasons Wood cites do not seem to me to actually rule out the possibility that there could (someday) be a predictive science of human behavior analogous to the science of mechanics. To begin with, it is unclear why solving the mind-body problem should be a condition of a predictive science of human <i>behavior.</i> One would think that such a science could remain wholly on the level of outer appearances, and disregard the inner, \xE2\x80\x9Cmental\xE2\x80\x9D side of the picture altogether. For the same reason, the uncertainty and deceptiveness characteristic of our awareness of our own motives would be irrelevant to a mechanistic behavioral science. The motives would not matter, as long as we could accurately predict the behavior that resulted from them. Nor does the last reason Wood gives seem entirely convincing to me. The problem of predicting how a person would behave in unusual situations from how they behave in familiar ones is a real issue, but there is no reason to believe it is unsolvable. For one thing, we can rely on observations of how <i>other</i> people with similar habits have behaved when confronted with a certain situation. Of course, due to the inherent complexity of the phenomena, we should expect that our ability to predict will probably always be less than perfect. Nevertheless, I cannot see why the possibility of a highly reliable predictive science of human behavior should be ruled out <i>a</i> <i>priori</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>Wood does, however, at least raise the interesting possibility that there is room in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s thought for a \xE2\x80\x9Cthird standpoint\xE2\x80\x9D that unites the theoretical and the practical. In the most philosophically interesting part of his contribution, Brian Jacobs develops this idea with his suggestion that the solution to the problem of finding a basis for the unification of the physiological and practical perspectives on the human being is to be found in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s anthropological conception of \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacter.\xE2\x80\x9D As Jacobs understands it, this conception of character possesses an ambiguity that particularly suits it for being a bridge between the natural and the moral conceptions of the human being. As he puts it, for Kant, \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacter ought to reveal both the basic psychological constitution of the person and the unmistakable traces of an intelligibly autonomous self\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 120). The term \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacter\xE2\x80\x9D refers to both the observable behavior of a person and a moral property \xE2\x80\x93 the person\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cway of thinking\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 that is not and never can be observed. The link between these two senses of the term is the fact that the observable behavior \xE2\x80\x9Cstands in for\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 we might say <i>expresses \xE2\x80\x93</i> the moral property. Mysterious as this notion is, it is congruent with what Kant says about beauty \xE2\x80\x9Csymbolizing\xE2\x80\x9D morality in the <i>Critique of Judgment</i>. Nevertheless, as Jacobs points out, \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacterization\xE2\x80\x9D for Kant must be distinguished from symbolization, insofar as only in the case of the latter function does the observed <i>resemble</i> the unobserved. If this is correct, then Kant operated with two <i>distinct</i> conceptions of ways in which the empirical phenomena could \xE2\x80\x9Cexpress\xE2\x80\x9D the purely intelligible.</p>  \n\
  <p>Patrick Kain, like Wood, contests what he sees as a widespread misconception about Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral psychology. In Kain\xE2\x80\x99s case, this is the view held by some contemporary Kantians that Kant does not (and perhaps cannot) provide any independent account of the normativity of prudential reason. Kain suggests that such an account might be based upon Kant\xE2\x80\x99s idea that one\xE2\x80\x99s own happiness or well-being is a \xE2\x80\x9Cnecessary end\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 250). This might explain, he thinks, why Kant believes that there is something irrational about pursuing a particular end or object that is in conflict with one\xE2\x80\x99s clear overall well-being; in the face of such a conflict, it only makes sense to give up the only end one <i>can</i> give up, namely, the <i>particular</i> end (Ibid.). As Kain recognizes, however, this entire line of argument depends upon establishing that happiness is in fact a necessary end. And this is a notion, as several commentators have recognized, which is very difficult to reconcile with central doctrines of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory, such as his view that the free will chooses its own ends.</p>  \n\
  <p>In addition to these questions about Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral psychology, there is the previously discussed question how we are to understand the relation of the anthropology writings to the critical system. Several of the authors touch on this question in one way or another, but it is Reinhard Brandt and Robert Louden who most clearly offer opposing estimations of the systematic importance of the anthropology. Brandt is convinced that pragmatic anthropology \xE2\x80\x9Cneither belongs to philosophy in a strict sense, nor is it articulated as a system based upon an idea of reason\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 85). In support of this claim, Brandt first argues that there is no obvious conceptual link between the two main divisions of the <i>Anthropology,</i> the \xE2\x80\x9Cdidactic\xE2\x80\x9D and the \xE2\x80\x9Ccharacteristic\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 89). Whatever unity is to be found here is, according to Brandt, something that developed only gradually and in stages, as Kant groped, in successive versions of the lectures, towards a progressively more complete presentation of a \xE2\x80\x9Cdoctrine of prudence\xE2\x80\x9D (the knowledge necessary for the successful pursuit of happiness in the world) (p. 91). Because of this basic orientation towards <i>prudential</i> (hence self-interested) action, Brandt concludes that \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatic anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D is fundamentally limited in its aims and hence cannot be identified with the discipline of practical anthropology that Kant claimed was the necessary complement to pure moral philosophy (p. 92). Finally, pragmatic anthropology is not properly philosophical, since it lacks an . <i>priori</i> dimension; even its discussion of the destiny or vocation [<i>Bestimmung</i>] of the human race \xE2\x80\x9Cis analyzed entirely empirically and as immanent to the world\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 93). We may thus view Brandt as laying down a challenge (and laying out some of the obstacles) to anyone who would claim to find in the anthropology an indispensable part of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s system of moral philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>This challenge is taken up by Robert Louden. Louden concedes that \xE2\x80\x9CKant nowhere (i.e., neither in the anthropology lectures nor anywhere else) hands over to his readers a single, complete, tidy package of moral anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 64). But rather than be daunted by this, Louden attempts to provide a <i>reconstruction</i> of the promised second, empirical part of moral philosophy from the material that Kant <i>does</i> provide. As against Brandt, Louden tries to show that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s pragmatic anthropology does indeed have both a properly <i>moral</i> (as opposed to a merely prudential), as well as an . <i>priori</i> dimension. According to Louden, the \xE2\x80\x9Coverarching goal\xE2\x80\x9D of the anthropology writings \xE2\x80\x9Cis to figure out what human nature is like in order more effectively to further moral ends\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 69). In order to do this, anthropology must of course provide accurate empirical knowledge, but it is not at all a \xE2\x80\x9CWeberian value-free undertaking\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 79). Rather, it is a mode of empirical inquiry framed by the <i>a</i> <i>priori</i> assumption that human beings are morally free and are destined to realize their freedom through the emergence of a \xE2\x80\x9Ccosmopolitan society\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 73). The descriptions of human beings that anthropology provides are intended to help realize this goal.</p>  \n\
  <p>Through his detailed scholarship, Louden does a commendable job of reconstructing a plausibly Kantian moral anthropology that overcomes some of Brandt\xE2\x80\x99s skeptical obstacles. However, there is another question that needs to be asked: does this reconstructed anthropology really constitute an <i>essential</i> supplement to the purely rational part of moral philosophy? Is it an indispensable part of the system of philosophy itself? Louden evidently endorses Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claim that moral philosophy \xE2\x80\x9Cneeds anthropology for its <i>application</i> to human beings\xE2\x80\x9D (4:412; 23). This is, however, a puzzling claim if we have in mind the famous examples of moral reasoning that Kant provides in the <i>Groundwork</i> and the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>. There the pure moral law (the categorical imperative) seems quite adequate all by itself for providing us with determinate answers to moral questions. Consider a question like \xE2\x80\x9CShould I make a false promise in order to obtain some ready cash?\xE2\x80\x9D The moral law, of course, answers this question in the negative. Anthropological knowledge is not obviously needed in order to translate this answer \xE2\x80\x9Cinto human terms\xE2\x80\x9D before it can be applied to my situation. The answer given by pure rational moral philosophy is already immediately applicable as it stands. So here is evidently a situation in which anthropology is <i>not</i> needed for the application of moral philosophy to human beings. But this is not just <i>any</i> situation; it is the <i>typical</i> situation for Kant. So what was Kant thinking when he made his remarks about the need for anthropology in order to make moral philosophy applicable to human beings? One possible answer is that Kant was thinking primarily of <i>moral education</i> here. Anthropological knowledge is necessary in order to educate human beings morally, to \xE2\x80\x9Cawaken their reason\xE2\x80\x9D and arouse their consciousness of the moral law that binds them. This interpretation is supported by passages like one cited by Louden himself, in which Kant explains why \xE2\x80\x9Cmorals must be united with knowledge of humanity\xE2\x80\x9D in the following terms: \xE2\x80\x9CThe reason that morals <i>and sermons \xE2\x80\xA6</i> have little effect is due to the lack of knowledge of the human being\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 66, quoting 25: 471-2, my emphasis). In other words, Kant is saying that merely moralizing and sermonizing is ineffective as a means of moral education if one lacks adequate knowledge of the specific cognitive capacities and motivations of human beings. One must know how to effectively awaken and elicit the inborn moral consciousness of human beings, and this requires a general \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatic\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge of their capacities and motives. But here we are talking about the essentially empirical methods of practical pedagogy, which should not be considered a part of moral philosophy proper. Anthropology, in other words, stands outside the system of philosophy.</p>  \n\
