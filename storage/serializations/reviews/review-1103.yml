  <p>First, let de Bary have his say.</p>  \n\
  <p>Reid, he says, \xE2\x80\x9C<i>starts</i> his reasoned attack on scepticism from a clear-eyed acknowledgement that in its most radical form, scepticism cannot be answered.\xE2\x80\x9D Two passages are cited where Reid is said to seem \xE2\x80\x9Copenly to countenance the possibility that an extreme scepticism might be correct\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 16). On the basis of these Reid is said to be \xE2\x80\x9Calways prepared (or at least <i>should</i> always be prepared) to entertain the possibility of global deception, even at God\xE2\x80\x99s hands\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 68). But both passages contain an \xE2\x80\x98if\xE2\x80\x99, as is indeed noticed in the case of a third remark on another subject (p. 82). Admittedly, in all three cases the antecedent is not cast in a conditional or subjunctive mood; but only in the last passage would the resulting implication of its falsity be appropriate. The two passages at issue constitute ripostes to the skeptic, where Reid is simply urging that the consequent follows from the antecedent; so an implication of the falsity of the antecedent, which in any case the skeptic would not concede, would not be in place. While it is an open question for the skeptic whether the belief in perception is right, it is not one for Reid himself (cf. pp. 74 and 178), who is merely pointing to what follows granted the truth of the antecedent, which he would not himself grant. Strangely, de Bary also allows that \xE2\x80\x9CReid does not think that we <i>are</i> in fact deceived\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 16).</p>  \n\
  <p>Further misunderstanding is betrayed in another reason given for ascribing fallibilism to Reid. A rhetorical question addressed to Cartesians asking why should consciousness be believed implicitly when they have supposed all other faculties fallacious, a clear <i>ad hominem</i> objection, is glossed as: \xE2\x80\x9CReid says, in effect, that if we insist, with Descartes and his followers, that foundational beliefs be immune to all conceivable doubt, we shall <i>have</i> no foundations\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 21) \xE2\x80\x9Cand the sceptic will have won\xE2\x80\x9D (pp. 28-9). The passage is taken as evidence that \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s fallibilism is thorough-going enough to extend even to\xE2\x80\x9D consciousness (p. 175). To be fair, \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s claim\xE2\x80\x9D is also said to be that \xE2\x80\x9Cit is <i>arbitrary</i> to trust\xE2\x80\x9D any one faculty over others (p. 23).</p>  \n\
  <p>As de Bary introduces it, Reid\xE2\x80\x99s supposed fallibilism amounts to what Jonathan Bennett characterizes as \xE2\x80\x9Cone of those epistemological blockbusters which begins, \xE2\x80\x98suppose that, as is logically possible, \xE2\x80\xA6 \xE2\x80\x98.\xE2\x80\x9D Thus: \xE2\x80\x9Cin his overarching fallibilism, we can see him conceding enough space for an extreme and irrefutable scepticism to inhabit, even if it is only the space of bare logical possibility\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 16). Since an applicable, non-formal criterion for logical possibility has so far escaped philosophers, what initially seems to be neither self-contradictory nor nonsense may yet turn out so on further argument. And as Reid himself holds, conceivability is no test of possibility. The arguments of Cudworth on the unintelligibility of universal doubt, later restated by Price, were evidently known to Hume. Although Reid does not cite Cudworth or Price on this issue, he must have read their accounts; as well as Locke\xE2\x80\x99s jest with the skeptic that \xE2\x80\x9Cif all be a Dream,\xE2\x80\x9D the skeptical questioning is part of this long dream so that it does not matter now what one calls a dream. Had Locke wrote \xE2\x80\x98is\xE2\x80\x99 rather than \xE2\x80\x98be\xE2\x80\x99 de Bary would take it as a concession; but Locke is not going to allow the skeptic that it is an open question whether all is a dream, because the hypothesis is vacuous. In the two Reid passages the vacuity rather of the consequent is being presumed. To take \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s meaning\xE2\x80\x9D as a dismissal of idle supposition is not to add to it. It is to take it as exhibiting \xE2\x80\x9Cthe specifically <i>religious</i> aspect of\xE2\x80\x9D his \xE2\x80\x9Crecoil\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 183) from \xE2\x80\x9Cthe possibility that God might deceive us for our own good\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 178); this exclusion, de Bary confesses, \xE2\x80\x9Cwould not only be a considerable embarrassment for our interpretation of Reid throughout this study\xE2\x80\x9D but would also make it \xE2\x80\x9Cimpossible, on <i>any</i> interpretation, to reconcile with those passages (admittedly few in number) which strongly suggest that Reid regards God\xE2\x80\x99s veracity as a genuinely open question\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ibid</i>.). Yet Reid is later imagined to think the possibility of \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternalistic deception\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ibid</i>.) by God \xE2\x80\x9Ctoo remote to disturb me\xE2\x80\x9D and to avow \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t really mind\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 189).</p>  \n\
  <p>In Chapter 4 a tamer fallibilism features: \xE2\x80\x9CThe three first principles that expressly vouch for the natural faculties say of those faculties, not that they are infallible \xE2\x80\xA6 but that they are \xE2\x80\x98not fallacious\xE2\x80\x99.\xE2\x80\x9D This uninteresting denial of \xE2\x80\x9Cinfallibilism\xE2\x80\x9D is conflated with the blockbuster fallibilism: no doubt Reid \xE2\x80\x9Cwould have <i>liked</i> it if his first principles could have been made absolutely demon-proof.\xE2\x80\x9D So while rightly urging that \xE2\x80\x9Coccasional error\xE2\x80\x9D is perfectly compatible with \xE2\x80\x9Coverall reliability\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 61), de Bary thinks proof against a deceiving demon, or God, would be available only if a claim to infallibility could be upheld. It is worth noting \xE2\x80\x94 though Reid does not seem to have done so \xE2\x80\x94 that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe argument from error\xE2\x80\x9D is frequently combined with some form of representationalism, as are the arguments for doubting in the First Meditation, whereby an attempt is made to drive a wedge between reality and human perception of it. Hume\xE2\x80\x99s argument for skepticism about reason exceptionally does not depend on the theory of ideas. Reid\xE2\x80\x99s assault on the theory, far from being irrelevant to diabolical or divine deception, has the potential to undermine the blockbuster fallibilism de Bary attributes to him.</p>  \n\
  <p>What is advertised as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe most crucial interpretative question about Reid\xE2\x80\x99s response to scepticism\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 37) is discussed in Chapter 5. Reid is said to make \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo claims\xE2\x80\x9D about the first principles of common sense: \xE2\x80\x9Can \xE2\x80\x98Innateness Claim\xE2\x80\x99 and a \xE2\x80\x98Truth Claim\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 4). The former, it is said, \xE2\x80\x9Cdescribes first principles,\xE2\x80\x9D the latter \xE2\x80\x9Clegitimates them\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 46, n. 14). Bits of Reid\xE2\x80\x99s sentences are assigned to one or the other \xE2\x80\x94 though it is added, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe need to insist on a sharper distinction than he usually troubles to make between these two claims for first principles\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 64). If Reid does not forge some link between the two, it is urged, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe sceptical challenge to their warrant will remain unmet\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 65). It is argued that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe blatant attempt to link the Innateness Claim and the Truth Claim for first principles via <i>belief in</i> a non-deceiving God is not one that can be pinned on Reid\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 69) and that there is no metaprinciple \xE2\x80\x9Camong Reid\xE2\x80\x99s principles of common sense\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 75). The conclusion is that \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s basic procedure with respect to this link is not really to try to forge it at all, but simply, baldly, daringly, to <i>assume</i> it\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 83).</p>  \n\
  <p>An introduction contains facts about Reid\xE2\x80\x99s life that almost all likely readers will not need to be reminded of, but it is also remarked there that the \xE2\x80\x9Cview of Reid as a worthy object of study\xE2\x80\x9D is a minority one (p. 4). The main conclusion will delight Reid\xE2\x80\x99s detractors. Again, it would be unfair not to record that the force of what may be called the burden of proof argument is often seen: it is for the skeptic to prove first principles doubtful. Indeed, at one place de Bary observes: \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s new way of doing epistemology means that guarantees can be done away with\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 68) \xE2\x80\x94 which does not prevent much agonizing later over \xE2\x80\x9Cthe role of God in Reid\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 165); for Reid is said to appear \xE2\x80\x9Cto turn to God\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cto underpin the Truth Claim\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 161). But how is there a truth claim at all? The notion seems not only to conflate justification with truth but in de Bary\xE2\x80\x99s hands to depict Reid as the dogmatist his detractors have always dismissed him as. There is no requirement that Reid say that first principles are true; he simply presumes that they are. It is for the skeptic to prove that he ought not to. More blurring occurs between proof and \xE2\x80\x9Cpositive argumentative support\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 130). While Reid denies that first principles are capable of direct proof, he scarcely abandons argument: the burden of proof argument is itself argument.</p>  \n\
  <p>Attention to specific principles in Chapter 9 would have revealed that it is not memory and testimony \xE2\x80\x9Con the whole\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 153) that can be confirmed by experience; rather, particular memory claims and pieces of testimony can receive corroboration. By contrast, appeal to \xE2\x80\x9Ctrack record arguments\xE2\x80\x9D with regard to the inductive principle does involve \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemic circularity\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 156); but then a principle of regularity in nature is not, as Reid supposes, a principle of inference.</p>  \n\
  <p>Despite what is said on p. 64, Reid never says that first principles are innate. Some explanation might seem to be called for why he rarely uses the term \xE2\x80\x98innate\xE2\x80\x99, were if not that Locke\xE2\x80\x99s attack on innate principles and Hume\xE2\x80\x99s scathing criticism of it in turn sufficiently explains Reid\xE2\x80\x99s avoidance of the term. The places were he does employ it \xE2\x80\x94 other than where he is referring to the doctrine of others \xE2\x80\x94 point to some distinction between intellectual capacities, where such terms as \xE2\x80\x98original\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98natural\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x98instinctive\xE2\x80\x99 are used instead, and other capacities, as when some desires and practical skills are described as innate. Thus, it is not that innate beliefs may not be true beliefs, as de Bary has as an objection (<i>ibid</i>.). Instead, innate, not beliefs, but dispositions \xE2\x80\x94 whether to act or to believe \xE2\x80\x94 hardly constitute knowledge of truths, even granted the pre-Lockean assumption that knowledge can be sensibly characterized as innate at all (see p. 87, n. 1). A connected point missed too is that principles of belief, which are psychological principles, cannot themselves be beliefs, as Reid\xE2\x80\x99s first principles are also intended to be. So \xE2\x80\x9Cthe most general laws by which we immediately assent to propositions upon understanding them\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 36), while psychological laws relating to the various propositions assented to, are distinct from these propositions. This distinction is not at all the same as the distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cparticular cases \xE2\x80\xA6 of self-evident beliefs\xE2\x80\x9D and the generalized first principles Reid lists (p. 36; cf. pp. 45-6, n. 2).</p>  \n\
  <p>If, as de Bary states, there is \xE2\x80\x9Cno dispute with Hume about the Innateness Claim as such\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 65), can Reid be rescued from the objection that he has argued fallaciously from the psychological disposition to hold a belief to the correctness of so holding it? It is time to scoop the baby up from the sink. The key argument, as was seen by Sidgwick and stated without reference to Reid by Moore, is that common sense beliefs are held by all, including skeptics. Hence they hold inconsistent beliefs, as Hume candidly acknowledged but Berkeley refused to. Skepticism is literally untenable. Since common sense beliefs are universally held, the only occasion there is to state that they are true is when arguing with skeptics who doubt their truth; but even then it is not required, for the burden of proof rests with the skeptic to prove their doubtfulness.</p>  \n\
  <p>Everybody thinks that colors, tastes and heat are part of the physical world; only ideal theorists also suppose that they exist in the mind. It is not that Reid \xE2\x80\x9Cmust regard vulgar notions of secondary qualities as strictly <i>wrong</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 44). He holds instead that ideal theorists miscall the qualities in bodies of colors, tastes and heat sensations. He defends the vulgar against the charge of confusing these qualities with sensations; though since sensations are rarely attended to, the distinction is made explicit only by philosophers. The caricature given of Reid\xE2\x80\x99s position is supported by the objection by Hume (p. 47, n. 21), which in collapsing any distinction between quality and sensation just presupposes the theory of ideas. Moreover, de Bary moves from Reid\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x98distinctly perceive\xE2\x80\x99 to his \xE2\x80\x98distinct notion\xE2\x80\x99: distinctly hearing or distinctly remembering is not as such having distinct notions. \xE2\x80\x98Distinctly\xE2\x80\x99 is rightly said to be a qualification on p. 45, yet is denied by implication to be so on p. 61.</p>  \n\
  <p>The first comma in the seventh principle occurs in the first edition; though \xE2\x80\x9Can oversight on Hamilton\xE2\x80\x99s part\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 80) does lead to a false accusation on p. 12 of misquotation. The kettle can accuse the pot of slight misquotation on pp. 37, 53 and 120. Brown is knighted on pp. 91 and 106. Minor errors occur on pp. 62, n. 5, 115 and 141.</p>"

A rhetorical question addressed to Cartesians asking why should consciousness be believed implicitly when they have supposed all other faculties fallacious, a clear <i>ad hominem</i> objection, is glossed as: \xE2\x80\x9CReid says, in effect, that if we insist, with Descartes and his followers, that foundational beliefs be immune to all conceivable doubt, we shall <i>have</i> no foundations\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 21) \xE2\x80\x9Cand the sceptic will have won\xE2\x80\x9D (pp. 28-9). The passage is taken as evidence that \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s fallibilism is thorough-going enough to extend even to\xE2\x80\x9D consciousness (p. 175). To be fair, \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s claim\xE2\x80\x9D is also said to be that \xE2\x80\x9Cit is <i>arbitrary</i> to trust\xE2\x80\x9D any one faculty over others (p. 23).</p>  \n\
  <p>As de Bary introduces it, Reid\xE2\x80\x99s supposed fallibilism amounts to what Jonathan Bennett characterizes as \xE2\x80\x9Cone of those epistemological blockbusters which begins, \xE2\x80\x98suppose that, as is logically possible, \xE2\x80\xA6 \xE2\x80\x98.\xE2\x80\x9D Thus: \xE2\x80\x9Cin his overarching fallibilism, we can see him conceding enough space for an extreme and irrefutable scepticism to inhabit, even if it is only the space of bare logical possibility\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 16). Since an applicable, non-formal criterion for logical possibility has so far escaped philosophers, what initially seems to be neither self-contradictory nor nonsense may yet turn out so on further argument. And as Reid himself holds, conceivability is no test of possibility. The arguments of Cudworth on the unintelligibility of universal doubt, later restated by Price, were evidently known to Hume. Although Reid does not cite Cudworth or Price on this issue, he must have read their accounts; as well as Locke\xE2\x80\x99s jest with the skeptic that \xE2\x80\x9Cif all be a Dream,\xE2\x80\x9D the skeptical questioning is part of this long dream so that it does not matter now what one calls a dream. Had Locke wrote \xE2\x80\x98is\xE2\x80\x99 rather than \xE2\x80\x98be\xE2\x80\x99 de Bary would take it as a concession; but Locke is not going to allow the skeptic that it is an open question whether all is a dream, because the hypothesis is vacuous. In the two Reid passages the vacuity rather of the consequent is being presumed. To take \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s meaning\xE2\x80\x9D as a dismissal of idle supposition is not to add to it. It is to take it as exhibiting \xE2\x80\x9Cthe specifically <i>religious</i> aspect of\xE2\x80\x9D his \xE2\x80\x9Crecoil\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 183) from \xE2\x80\x9Cthe possibility that God might deceive us for our own good\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 178); this exclusion, de Bary confesses, \xE2\x80\x9Cwould not only be a considerable embarrassment for our interpretation of Reid throughout this study\xE2\x80\x9D but would also make it \xE2\x80\x9Cimpossible, on <i>any</i> interpretation, to reconcile with those passages (admittedly few in number) which strongly suggest that Reid regards God\xE2\x80\x99s veracity as a genuinely open question\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ibid</i>.). Yet Reid is later imagined to think the possibility of \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternalistic deception\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ibid</i>.) by God \xE2\x80\x9Ctoo remote to disturb me\xE2\x80\x9D and to avow \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t really mind\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 189).</p>  \n\
  <p>In Chapter 4 a tamer fallibilism features: \xE2\x80\x9CThe three first principles that expressly vouch for the natural faculties say of those faculties, not that they are infallible \xE2\x80\xA6 but that they are \xE2\x80\x98not fallacious\xE2\x80\x99.\xE2\x80\x9D This uninteresting denial of \xE2\x80\x9Cinfallibilism\xE2\x80\x9D is conflated with the blockbuster fallibilism: no doubt Reid \xE2\x80\x9Cwould have <i>liked</i> it if his first principles could have been made absolutely demon-proof.\xE2\x80\x9D So while rightly urging that \xE2\x80\x9Coccasional error\xE2\x80\x9D is perfectly compatible with \xE2\x80\x9Coverall reliability\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 61), de Bary thinks proof against a deceiving demon, or God, would be available only if a claim to infallibility could be upheld. It is worth noting \xE2\x80\x94 though Reid does not seem to have done so \xE2\x80\x94 that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe argument from error\xE2\x80\x9D is frequently combined with some form of representationalism, as are the arguments for doubting in the First Meditation, whereby an attempt is made to drive a wedge between reality and human perception of it. Hume\xE2\x80\x99s argument for skepticism about reason exceptionally does not depend on the theory of ideas. Reid\xE2\x80\x99s assault on the theory, far from being irrelevant to diabolical or divine deception, has the potential to undermine the blockbuster fallibilism de Bary attributes to him.</p>  \n\
  <p>What is advertised as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe most crucial interpretative question about Reid\xE2\x80\x99s response to scepticism\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 37) is discussed in Chapter 5. Reid is said to make \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo claims\xE2\x80\x9D about the first principles of common sense: \xE2\x80\x9Can \xE2\x80\x98Innateness Claim\xE2\x80\x99 and a \xE2\x80\x98Truth Claim\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 4). The former, it is said, \xE2\x80\x9Cdescribes first principles,\xE2\x80\x9D the latter \xE2\x80\x9Clegitimates them\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 46, n. 14). Bits of Reid\xE2\x80\x99s sentences are assigned to one or the other \xE2\x80\x94 though it is added, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe need to insist on a sharper distinction than he usually troubles to make between these two claims for first principles\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 64). If Reid does not forge some link between the two, it is urged, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe sceptical challenge to their warrant will remain unmet\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 65). It is argued that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe blatant attempt to link the Innateness Claim and the Truth Claim for first principles via <i>belief in</i> a non-deceiving God is not one that can be pinned on Reid\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 69) and that there is no metaprinciple \xE2\x80\x9Camong Reid\xE2\x80\x99s principles of common sense\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 75). The conclusion is that \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s basic procedure with respect to this link is not really to try to forge it at all, but simply, baldly, daringly, to <i>assume</i> it\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 83).</p>  \n\
  <p>An introduction contains facts about Reid\xE2\x80\x99s life that almost all likely readers will not need to be reminded of, but it is also remarked there that the \xE2\x80\x9Cview of Reid as a worthy object of study\xE2\x80\x9D is a minority one (p. 4). The main conclusion will delight Reid\xE2\x80\x99s detractors. Again, it would be unfair not to record that the force of what may be called the burden of proof argument is often seen: it is for the skeptic to prove first principles doubtful. Indeed, at one place de Bary observes: \xE2\x80\x9CReid\xE2\x80\x99s new way of doing epistemology means that guarantees can be done away with\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 68) \xE2\x80\x94 which does not prevent much agonizing later over \xE2\x80\x9Cthe role of God in Reid\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 165); for Reid is said to appear \xE2\x80\x9Cto turn to God\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cto underpin the Truth Claim\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 161). But how is there a truth claim at all? The notion seems not only to conflate justification with truth but in de Bary\xE2\x80\x99s hands to depict Reid as the dogmatist his detractors have always dismissed him as. There is no requirement that Reid say that first principles are true; he simply presumes that they are. It is for the skeptic to prove that he ought not to. More blurring occurs between proof and \xE2\x80\x9Cpositive argumentative support\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 130). While Reid denies that first principles are capable of direct proof, he scarcely abandons argument: the burden of proof argument is itself argument.</p>  \n\
  <p>Attention to specific principles in Chapter 9 would have revealed that it is not memory and testimony \xE2\x80\x9Con the whole\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 153) that can be confirmed by experience; rather, particular memory claims and pieces of testimony can receive corroboration. By contrast, appeal to \xE2\x80\x9Ctrack record arguments\xE2\x80\x9D with regard to the inductive principle does involve \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemic circularity\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 156); but then a principle of regularity in nature is not, as Reid supposes, a principle of inference.</p>  \n\
  <p>Despite what is said on p. 64, Reid never says that first principles are innate. Some explanation might seem to be called for why he rarely uses the term \xE2\x80\x98innate\xE2\x80\x99, were if not that Locke\xE2\x80\x99s attack on innate principles and Hume\xE2\x80\x99s scathing criticism of it in turn sufficiently explains Reid\xE2\x80\x99s avoidance of the term. The places were he does employ it \xE2\x80\x94 other than where he is referring to the doctrine of others \xE2\x80\x94 point to some distinction between intellectual capacities, where such terms as \xE2\x80\x98original\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98natural\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x98instinctive\xE2\x80\x99 are used instead, and other capacities, as when some desires and practical skills are described as innate. Thus, it is not that innate beliefs may not be true beliefs, as de Bary has as an objection (<i>ibid</i>.). Instead, innate, not beliefs, but dispositions \xE2\x80\x94 whether to act or to believe \xE2\x80\x94 hardly constitute knowledge of truths, even granted the pre-Lockean assumption that knowledge can be sensibly characterized as innate at all (see p. 87, n. 1). A connected point missed too is that principles of belief, which are psychological principles, cannot themselves be beliefs, as Reid\xE2\x80\x99s first principles are also intended to be. So \xE2\x80\x9Cthe most general laws by which we immediately assent to propositions upon understanding them\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 36), while psychological laws relating to the various propositions assented to, are distinct from these propositions. This distinction is not at all the same as the distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cparticular cases \xE2\x80\xA6 of self-evident beliefs\xE2\x80\x9D and the generalized first principles Reid lists (p. 36; cf. pp. 45-6, n. 2).</p>  \n\
  <p>If, as de Bary states, there is \xE2\x80\x9Cno dispute with Hume about the Innateness Claim as such\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 65), can Reid be rescued from the objection that he has argued fallaciously from the psychological disposition to hold a belief to the correctness of so holding it? It is time to scoop the baby up from the sink. The key argument, as was seen by Sidgwick and stated without reference to Reid by Moore, is that common sense beliefs are held by all, including skeptics. Hence they hold inconsistent beliefs, as Hume candidly acknowledged but Berkeley refused to. Skepticism is literally untenable. Since common sense beliefs are universally held, the only occasion there is to state that they are true is when arguing with skeptics who doubt their truth; but even then it is not required, for the burden of proof rests with the skeptic to prove their doubtfulness.</p>  \n\
  <p>Everybody thinks that colors, tastes and heat are part of the physical world; only ideal theorists also suppose that they exist in the mind. It is not that Reid \xE2\x80\x9Cmust regard vulgar notions of secondary qualities as strictly <i>wrong</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 44). He holds instead that ideal theorists miscall the qualities in bodies of colors, tastes and heat sensations. He defends the vulgar against the charge of confusing these qualities with sensations; though since sensations are rarely attended to, the distinction is made explicit only by philosophers. The caricature given of Reid\xE2\x80\x99s position is supported by the objection by Hume (p. 47, n. 21), which in collapsing any distinction between quality and sensation just presupposes the theory of ideas. Moreover, de Bary moves from Reid\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x98distinctly perceive\xE2\x80\x99 to his \xE2\x80\x98distinct notion\xE2\x80\x99: distinctly hearing or distinctly remembering is not as such having distinct notions. \xE2\x80\x98Distinctly\xE2\x80\x99 is rightly said to be a qualification on p. 45, yet is denied by implication to be so on p. 61.</p>  \n\
  <p>The first comma in the seventh principle occurs in the first edition; though \xE2\x80\x9Can oversight on Hamilton\xE2\x80\x99s part\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 80) does lead to a false accusation on p. 12 of misquotation. The kettle can accuse the pot of slight misquotation on pp. 37, 53 and 120. Brown is knighted on pp. 91 and 106. Minor errors occur on pp. 62, n. 5, 115 and 141.</p>"
