capitalism (exchange value).<span style=\"\">  </span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The affinity between Marx and Whitehead that Pomeroy recognizes exists on several levels: both thinkers situate ideas in experience and history as fallible generalizations.<span style=\"\">  </span>Both begin with experience and return to it; both identify the false dichotomies and abstractions that mystify thought; both develop concepts that could be described as dialectical.<span style=\"\">  </span>Both are said to rely upon <i>internal relations </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">in their analyses: Marx at the level of \"macrocosmic empirical analysis of social production\" (69) and Whitehead at the microcosmic or metaphysical level of actual entities.<span style=\"\">  </span>Marx's category of production is the functional equivalent of process in Whitehead's thought.<span style=\"\">  </span>Both process and production share these features: \"Productive ability as the driving force behind world process (creativity), creative dependence on the given as its source and product (actuality), and thus deep interdependence of all elements of reality on all others as mutually constituting (being as fully relational)\" (61).<span style=\"\">  </span>Persons--like the actual entities of metaphysics--transform the given data in producing their world as new (66).<span style=\"\">  </span>With the notion of internal relations--appropriated from Leibniz by Whitehead--Pomeroy endeavors to dissolve intractable standoffs, such as freedom/determinism, physical/conceptual, one/many, or possibility/necessity, by showing how both dimensions constitute each entity.<span style=\"\">  </span>Being determined by the past does not exclude the emergence of possibilities in the present.<span style=\"\">  </span>Creativity is fundamental to the emergence of things from prior conditions.<span style=\"\">  </span>What ordinary habits of thought separate, process thought discloses as inseparable.<span style=\"\">  </span>The basic ideas of Whitehead, in Pomeroy's hands, allow us to get past the sterile readings of Marx and show the continuity between the early and later texts.<span style=\"\">  </span>\"Whitehead's metaphysics will present us with new language . . . of feeling and relation . . . mutual constitution and creativity . . . organicism and materialism . . . language . . . rich with developmental possibilities\" (14).</span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"\"> </span>By appealing to process thought, Pomeroy locates normativity within the most fundamental features of all things.<span style=\"\">  </span>To read Marx adequately requires upheaval at the level of metaphysics.<span style=\"\">  </span>\"The metaphysical is itself the indictment\" (195).<span style=\"\">  </span>Norms are not \"outside reality.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>They do not arise from feelings projected by subjects onto objects; norms are not constructed; they are not planted on the subjective side of a subjective/object divide.<span style=\"\">  </span>The normative dimension goes to the core of reality; the <i>critique </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">of capital is generated by the tension between the dialectical process that underlies </span><i>all </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">reality and the </span><i>undialectical </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">form of capitalist production that impoverishes and distorts basic features of reality.<span style=\"\">  </span></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">For example, to understand what's wrong with wage labor is to grasp the tension between the process of production--whereby individuals constitute both self and their world--and the fixed quantity or wage which is said to be the equal to this process.<span style=\"\">  </span>What is dead--the wage--in principle cannot measure living labor.<span style=\"\">  </span>\"The exchange of a determination that is past for the human activity that is present(ed) is absolutely illegitimate\" (120).<span style=\"\">  </span>Pomeroy calls this the \"first injustice from which all the further injustices flow\" (121).<span style=\"\">  </span>Capitalism violates the \"original ontological incommensurability of persons and things\" (122).<span style=\"\">  </span>To treat persons as objects exemplifies injustice.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">In a similar way, the expropriation of surplus value separates persons from the newness or excess that marks their activity as \"truly human.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Pomeroy identifies the capitalist notion of \"surplus\" with the metaphysical category of \"novelty.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Human labor is treated as an object when stripped of this excess.<span style=\"\">  </span>The push to reduce necessary labor in order to expropriate a larger surplus robs persons of their inherent nature as creative.<span style=\"\">  </span>What constitutes the self and its world must belong to the self.<span style=\"\">  </span>Capitalism unleashes human creativity on a massive scale, but does not allow genuinely new possibilities to arise.<span style=\"\">  </span>\"Present creativity sparked by future envisionment has been reduced to the abstract monetary expression of the generalized past labor of my brothers

style=\"\">   </span>The necessity under capitalism to measure living labor in terms of the abstractions of value violates our fundamental human character.<span style=\"\">  </span>The category of

really congealed labor--that is the life blood, the potential and real creativity of the human being hardened into mere physicality--into the not-human.<span style=\"\">  </span>Subjective creativity
