  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In 1998, Andy Clark and  David Chalmers published an essay in <i style="">Analysis</i> entitled "The Extended Mind" that proposed and defended a radical claim. They argued that minds can and sometimes do extend beyond our skin out into the  broader world, in non-biological representational systems and devices. To  properly understand minds, they claimed, we need to recognize not just how they  interact with the outside world; we also must recognize that aspects of the non-biological world are, in certain situations, actually constitutive  of them. Clark and Chalmers' article has since prompted a variety of responses.  Richard Menary's new volume presents fourteen such reactions that (along with  Clark and Chalmers' original essay) defend, criticize, or further develop and  advance the extended mind hypothesis (hereafter, EMH). Despite varying widely in  quality, these essays offer an interesting and often provocative array of  perspectives on the physical boundaries of mentality.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The volume has two apparent but unstated  agendas. One goal is to defend the general outlook of EMH from various challenges.  All but 3 of the essays are strongly supportive, and even the introduction openly endorses the EMH stance. There is, of course, nothing wrong with this,  but readers should not expect equal treatment by both sides of this issue.  The second objective is to help develop a "second-wave" version of EMH that pushes EMH in a different direction. To better see how these  agendas play out, it will help to first consider two central principles that inform  many of the discussions.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The first principle is endorsed in Clark and  Chalmers' cornerstone essay and has come to be known as the "parity principle":</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">If, as we confront  some task, a part of the world functions as a process which, <i style="">were it done  in the head</i>, we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the cognitive process, then that part of the  world <i style="">is</i> . . . part of the cognitive process. (p. 29)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Like many philosophical tenets, the parity  principle is motivated by a central thought-experiment. Clark and Chalmers ask us to  imagine an Alzheimers' victim, Otto, who relies upon a trusty and ever-present  notebook to store vital information. Because the notebook functions so much like a normal person's memory, Clark and Chalmers suggest it actually <i style="">is</i> Otto's memory, with its inscriptions serving as his long-standing beliefs. The parity principle is largely  driven by functionalist intuitions. If functional role is what defines mental  states and processes, then just as it is prejudicial to claim that minds must be instantiated in neurons, so too, EMH proponents suggest, it is equally prejudicial to assume that minds must be instantiated within the skull.  When devices, symbol systems, and other things in the world function  sufficiently like things we normally regard as cognitive, then they too should be  regarded as cognitive and, indeed, as parts of our minds.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The second credo is an alleged fallacy that,  according to Fred Adams and Ken Aizawa, EMH proponents commit -- the "coupling-constitution fallacy":</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The fallacious  pattern is to draw attention to cases, real or imagined, in which some object or  process is coupled in some fashion to some cognitive agent. From this, one slides  to the conclusion that the object or process constitutes part of the agent's  cognitive apparatus or cognitive processing. (p. 68)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In their contribution, Adams and Aizawa insist  that there is no good reason for treating Otto's notebook as <i style="">part of</i>  his cognitive system, as opposed to external tools that <i style="">assist</i>  his cognitive activity. It is one thing to be causally or computationally relied upon <i style="">by</i> a  mind when it engages in various intellectual tasks, it is another thing to actually be a <i style="">component</i> of such a mind. To bolster their claim, Adams and Aizawa propose their  own criterion for mentality: non-derived intentionality, which is lacking in  external symbol systems like Otto's notebook.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">There is an obvious tension between these two  precepts. If it <i style="">is</i> a fallacy to treat things coupled to a cognitive agent as parts of a cognitive system, then the  parity principle is in trouble. If, on the other hand, functional parity is  sufficient for mentality, then certain coupled elements really are parts of our  minds. In certain respects, the first four chapters of Menary's volume, and many  parts of subsequent chapters, involve a debate over which of these two principles  should be given priority. Clark's second essay, "<i style="">Memento</i>'s  Revenge", is partly designed to re-affirm and defend the parity principle from various criticisms. It is followed by a  further rebuttal by Adams and Aizawa in which they answer criticisms of their  own coupling-constitution fallacy. This, in turn, is followed by a further (re)rebuttal by Clark, which, as might be expected, further defends  parity and rejects the charge of fallacious reasoning.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The exchanges in these first four chapters adopt  a dialectic that has become commonplace in debates about EMH. Because of  the emphasis upon parity, proponents emphasize how much extra-cranial  systems function just like intra-cranial systems and critics emphasize how much  they don't. Or, alternatively, proponents emphasize how dissimilar from one  another conventional inner cognitive operations can be (thereby suggesting  various functional differences are not critical), while critics emphasize their  core uniformity. For instance, Clark repeatedly highlights the ways in which external elements help us in the same ways that internal elements do,  and also the degree to which we already acknowledge different types of capacities  like memory. Adams and Aizawa, on the other hand, stress how much things like  Otto's notebook is unlike biological memory (because it must be read and  interpreted) and how biologicality provides a unified base for mentality.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">While these exchanges are often insightful, they  fail to accomplish any clear consensus or advance the discussion very far. The  debate would have benefitted from some prior agreement on what counts as  getting it right -- on, say, how we might discern the difference between a  cognitive system's parts and non-parts. Without this, the two sides often talk  past each other. For example, Clark (along with Menary) criticizes Adams and  Aizawa for confusedly thinking that the extended mind position entails that objects  (like Otto's notebook) can be intrinsically cognitive, irrespective of  whatever role they are playing. As Clark points out, no proponent of EMH thinks <i style="">that</i>; it is essential that the object be properly conjoined or integrated with a brain. Yet, in fact, this is an uncharitable interpretation of Adams and Aizawa, whose whole argument is designed to show that integration with a brain is not enough.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The other critics of EMH in this volume also  emphasize a lack of functional parity between the inner and outer. Robert Rupert  focuses on language processing and persuasively argues that the usual explananda of cognitive science undermine the EMH outlook. Developmental psychologists  want to know how children come to learn a language, and for that we need to  regard the cognitive agent as a persisting, unified system. But extended  coupled systems are short-lived -- unlike biological sub-systems, external  components attach only for brief periods. It is thereby hard to see how we could  have a science about a series of short-lived hybrid systems. John Preston, like  Adams and Aizawa, describes dissimilarities between the inscriptions in Otto's notebook and beliefs as understood by common sense. Preston's focus is  upon access; as he notes, while we have first-person authority regarding what  we believe, externally stored information lacks this access: Otto needs to  use perception to discover not just what is in the world, but also what he believes. He claims that these functional dissimilarities undermine EMH.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Although Clark does not directly respond to  Rupert or Preston, it is easy to imagine his rebuttal: yes, these dissimilarities  do exist, but they are not essential and are no more interesting than other dissimilarities between conventional internal states and sub-systems. So  while critics challenge EMH by emphasizing a lack of functional parity between  the inner and outer, proponents insist these functional dissimilarities  don't matter. Yet this discussion is in need of a prior and principled way of demarcating those functional properties that make something <i style="">part  of</i> a cognitive system from those functional properties that do not. This is a topic that Michael Wheeler attempts to address in his clear and interesting defense of extended functionalism. Wheeler acknowledges that the debate over parity often  slips into the type of standoff between conservative and liberal  functionalists that we see here between Clark and his critics. Wheeler offers a reasonable  strategy for resolving this impasse: we should ask, counterfactually, would we  continue regarding a conventional cognitive state or process as mental if it  happened to lack the property in question? If the answer is "yes", then we should not exclude external elements just because they happen to lack that  feature. For example, if a lesion caused a person's memory to stop displaying  generation effects, would we stop treating this faculty as real memory? Presumably  not. Thus, (contra Rupert, 2004) generation effects are not essential for  memory.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Despite this sensible proposal, it is doubtful  that it can always break the stalemate. If, say, a person's beliefs were to lose  the property of first-person access, would they still count as real beliefs?  I suspect Clark would claim that they would (insisting that this  difference doesn't matter), whereas Preston would say they wouldn't (insisting this difference does matter).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">But even if Wheeler's strategy does help, there  is another worry raised by Rupert that deserved greater attention than  provided in this volume. Insofar as the adoption of EMH would still require  acknowledging the same critical distinctions between what is inner and what is outer,  between what is biological and what isn't, the worry is that the adoption of EMH  would amount to nothing more than a re-labeling. We now investigate the ways  minds interact with non-mental things like public words and symbols. An EMH revolution would involve the same divisions; we would just start talking  about investigating the ways the <i style="">biological parts </i>of our minds interact with the <i style="">non-biological parts</i> of our minds. Not much would change except the words we use.  This worry is substantially exacerbated when we turn to the essays promoting  the second goal of this volume. This is because those essays embrace (rather  than downplay) the distinctions between what's in the skull and what's  outside.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">With the type of EMH described thus far, both  sides have leaned upon the parity principle -- upon the functional similarity or dissimilarity of outer states and processes with conventional (i.e.,  inner, biological) cognitive states and processes to make their case either for  or against EMH. But there is a completely different outlook that forms the foundation of the second-wave perspective. The proponents of this new  outlook openly abandon the parity principle in favor of what one author (Sutton)  refers to as the "complementarity principle". This latter principle rejects the idea that external factors must be functionally similar to  conventional mental states and processes to qualify as cognitive. Instead, what  matters is <i style="">integration with</i> biological systems to form a broader, hybrid cognitive system. For these authors, Otto's  notebook isn't part of Otto's mind because it functions just like Otto's old  memory. Instead, it is part of his mind because it is systematically and  reciprocally <i style="">integrated </i>with his biological brain during various episodes of cognition. By replacing the parity principle  with the complementarity principle, proponents of second-wave EMH can simply side-step those critics who complain that what's extra-cranial is not functionally similar to what's intra-cranial.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Menary's own contribution, along with his  introduction, provides a clear articulation of second-wave EMH. He offers a task-based conception of a cognitive process which is then used to support an  externalist conception of cognitive systems. For him, what makes outer items truly cognitive is not parity but rather the distinctive roles they play in  the overall performance of a task that is cognitive in nature. If, say, the  task is doing long division with pencil and paper, then the pencil and paper  serve as components of an extended cognitive system, not because they resemble  something neurological when division is done in the head, but rather because they  are integral parts of a system performing a cognitive task: "The primary motivation for cognitive integration is the brute fact of our  embodiment, especially our bodily manipulation of environmental vehicles" (p. 229).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Along similar lines, John Sutton joins Menary in developing a second-wave EMH position. To illustrate his complementarity principle, Sutton discusses two historical examples. The first involves Elizabethan actors at the Globe theater, who were required to perform an incredibly large number of different roles with minimal rehearsal. This  was possible only because the physical lay-out of the sets, social  variables, and various props served as information-bearing elements that helped to  guide the actors' performance. The second example concerns the medieval memory  palaces used by monks and scholars for storing large amounts of information.  With this mnemonic strategy, buildings or familiar streets were memorized and then  used to store various bits of information for later retrieval. Sutton claims  this qualifies as a form of extended cognition, though I had a hard time understanding how it does. Given that the process involves everything  being internalized (with memorized images of spatial geography used as  mnemonic aids), just how this is supposed to support EMH is a bit mysterious.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Robert Wilson also offers an intriguing essay  that can be seen as supporting second-wave EMH, though he initially presents an  argument that appears to embrace parity. Wilson focuses upon "meaning making" -- our employment of various different internal and external  representational states and devices for various purposes. Just as developmental systems  theory helps us to see how various external factors contribute to organismic  inheritance and development, so too a proper understanding of our status as  "semantic engines" demands that we treat external symbols, signs, and linguistic tools as parts of our own cognitive apparatus. Ultimately, Wilson  suggests that the specific form or location of these "mental representations" is less important to our understanding of intentionality than the fact that  they play <i style="">some</i> sort of causal role in perception and behavior.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Language is also the focus of the chapter  authored by David Spurrett and Stephen Cowley, who regard language as an outgrowth  of more primitive "utterance activities". They propose that communicative gestures and acts sometimes give rise to a type of extended cognition in  which two communicators should not be viewed as two distinct individuals, but  rather as a complex hybrid. When a Zulu mother deliberately dominates the  perceptual and behavioral field of her infant to calm the child, Spurrett and  Cowley suggest the infant's mind is "colonized" by the mother's.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">All of these authors make a strong case for  thinking that various outer, non-biological elements that are markedly different from internal elements are nevertheless important (indeed, necessary) for  specific cognitive tasks and activities. They make a strong case for a high  degree of integration. Unfortunately, they fail to make a strong case for treating  these integrated external structures as parts of an expanded mind. There is  nothing here, as far as I can see, that would alleviate the worry that EMH is  based upon a coupling-constitution fallacy. We are repeatedly told how  second-wave EMH would be a dramatic departure from our current perspective and would  have radical new consequences for our conception of mentality, language  systems, reasoning, etc. On that we can all agree. But we are told much less  about why such a dramatic departure is a good idea, or just what the explanatory  pay-off would be.
  </p><p class="NDPRBodyTexT">What these authors need, but do not really provide, is an  argument for treating external structures as not only important for (and  integrated with) cognitive systems during various cognitive tasks -- something  Adams and Aizawa are happy to concede -- but for also treating them as actually  mental states. Why, for example, should the actor's stage artifacts and props  be treated as elements of an expanded cognitive system, instead of as, more conventionally, non-cognitive mnemonic tools that aid the actor's  memory? Sutton doesn't really tell us. Menary offers the proposal that external elements are not mere tools because biological minds act upon them and  vice versa -- that they are reciprocally integrated with one another. But  that is hardly a convincing justification for thinking something is part of  something else (when chopping wood, I am reciprocally integrated with an ax, but  that doesn't make the ax part of me). At least with first-wave EMH and the  parity principle, there was an intuitive response to the coupling-constitution criticism: outer elements are not mere tools because, in certain  circumstances, there is no relevant difference in their functional role and the role of internal elements; hence, treating their location as relevant is a mere prejudice. But with second-wave EMH and its abandonment of the parity  principle, a key justification for <i style="">not</i> regarding external structures as non-systemic aids is lost. In large measure, the  essays supporting second-wave EMH in this volume do not answer the coupling-constitution fallacy so much as they simply ignore it.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">How could one show that something is a <i style="">real</i> part of a system, as opposed to merely being causally integrated with it? What sort of distinction is  this? Is it objectively real, or is it instead some sort of construct? It is  unfortunate that these types of meta-questions don't receive further attention here. Moreover, it is surprising that none of the authors offer either a  defense or critique of EMH that appeals to a broader analysis of systems. After  all, there are lots of biological systems associated with our selves that are  equally plausible candidates for extension. Is an asthmatic's inhaler part of  her respiratory system or merely an aid to it? How should one try to answer  such a question and what counts as getting it right? Consider what the parity  principle might look like applied to our digestion system:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">If, as we confront  some task, a part of the world functions as a process which, <i style="">were it done  in our gut</i>, we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the digestive process, then that part of the world <i style="">is</i> . . . part of the digestive process.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Suppose our evolutionary history had been quite  different and we had evolved blenders as part of our biological digestive tract.  It seems clear that if blending was part of our natural digestive process, we  would have no hesitation in recognizing biological blending as part of our  digestive system. But that counterfactual truth in no way tempts me to think that  the blender on my kitchen counter should now count as <i style="">part of</i>  my digestive system. Why should cognition be treated any differently? Many of the debates that take center stage in this volume  lead to no clear resolution in part because basic questions like these are not  properly addressed.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Nearly all of the essays discussed so far focus  upon the intentional aspect of cognition -- on representational states like  memories and beliefs. The phenomenal aspect of the mind has received much less  attention in the EMH literature, and in their original essay Clark and Chalmers were  careful to avoid claiming that consciousness itself might be located beyond the  skull. But two of the most intriguing essays in this collection do not shy away  from that proposal.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In her lengthy and complicated contribution,  Susan Hurley offers a framework for EMH that distinguishes "What" from "How" externalism, and "Content" from "Quality" externalism. This taxonomy helps her to expose an important and  interesting paradox that is the focal point of her essay. Given that there is a  large intuitive gap between our understanding of brains and qualitative  experience (where we can't really see how the former can instantiate the latter),  then why is there such a strong intuition that qualitative experience must be  entirely realized by what is inside the skull? As she puts it: "if we have so  little understanding of how phenomenal qualities could possibly be explained,  why are we so confident that if they can be, the explanation must be  internalist?" (p. 145). Hurley offers a diagnosis of this paradox that aims to make externalism toward phenomenal states more palatable. By focusing on  perceptual examples where external factors determine the classification of specific qualitative properties (where neural correlates of specific qualia can  vary), Hurley argues that external factors are essential to explaining the  'what-it's-likeness' of perceptual states. While this was perhaps the most demanding chapter  in the collection, there is much here that makes the effort worthwhile.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Mark Rowlands' careful yet somewhat cryptic  essay also promotes the view that conscious experience is at least partially  realized in elements that extend beyond the nervous system. Rowlands notes that  while standard accounts of phenomenal experience appeal to modes of  presentation, they overlook that such a mode has a dual role -- as an object of  apprehension, but also as a vehicle or "enabler" of that experience (much like Frege's dual-role notion of sense). To clarify his position, Rowlands  invokes Merleau-Ponty's example of a blind man using a cane. Much of the time,  the cane itself is not an object of perception -- it is instead a "vehicle" of perceptual experience used to detect objects, as a conduit of the  blind's man's phenomenal experience of the world. In similar fashion, Rowlands  suggests that saccadic eye scans, "attention-grabbing" mechanisms, and spatial patterns of light also serve as vehicles by which the world is revealed.  While Rowland's suggestions are intriguing, his arguments for thinking<b style=""> </b>either that modes of presentations can serve as unapprehended vehicles of conscious experience or that they can  be instantiated by things like saccadic eye movements are far from clear.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Finally, undoubtedly the oddest chapter is this  volume is one that inadvertently suggests that the whole topic is deeply  ill-conceived. In a somewhat condescending tone, Don Ross and James Ladyman tell us  that that the coupling-constitution fallacy is based upon a naive and flawed  conception of reality, since, at the level of fundamental physics, conventional  notions like causation and constitution have no real application. Curiously,  they see this as only a problem for the critics of EMH. Given that EMH itself  depends on the idea that certain things are parts of other things (minds), their conclusion should have been that EMH is itself a confused non-issue (presumably, their essay isn't "part of" a volume devoted to such a non-issue). Perhaps the real take-home lesson from this chapter is  something most of us already believed; namely, that whatever bizarre things  physicists tell us about fundamental particles, their statements should have very  little bearing on what we think about middle-sized things like cognitive  systems.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Beyond these concerns about the individual  chapters, it should be noted that there is no discernible organizational scheme  behind the ordering of the essays. While the topics may not lend themselves to any obvious sequence, it would have helped if the editor had used the introduction  to explain why he adopted the arrangement he did.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Yet despite this and the other concerns  mentioned above, this collection is hardly a flop. Quite the contrary, it is easily the  most broad-themed and diverse book on the topic of extended cognition.  Indeed, one of its greatest virtues may be that it presents so many of the different  ways people think about EMH. Insofar as some of those ways have problems that  have not yet been addressed, it is enormously beneficial to have these  brought to light. Menary's collection does enhance our understanding of extended  minds and will thus significantly advance the discussion, though perhaps in ways  that were not directly intended.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style="">References<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Rupert, Robert (2004): "Challenges to the  Hypothesis of Extended Cognition." <i style="">Journal of Philosophy</i>, 101(8), 389-428.</p>

John Preston, like  Adams and Aizawa, describes dissimilarities between the inscriptions in Otto's notebook and beliefs as understood by common sense. Preston's focus is  upon access; as he notes, while we have first-person authority regarding what  we believe, externally stored information lacks this access: Otto needs to  use perception to discover not just what is in the world, but also what he believes. He claims that these functional dissimilarities undermine EMH.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Although Clark does not directly respond to  Rupert or Preston, it is easy to imagine his rebuttal: yes, these dissimilarities  do exist, but they are not essential and are no more interesting than other dissimilarities between conventional internal states and sub-systems. So  while critics challenge EMH by emphasizing a lack of functional parity between  the inner and outer, proponents insist these functional dissimilarities  don't matter. Yet this discussion is in need of a prior and principled way of demarcating those functional properties that make something <i style="">part  of</i> a cognitive system from those functional properties that do not. This is a topic that Michael Wheeler attempts to address in his clear and interesting defense of extended functionalism. Wheeler acknowledges that the debate over parity often  slips into the type of standoff between conservative and liberal  functionalists that we see here between Clark and his critics. Wheeler offers a reasonable  strategy for resolving this impasse: we should ask, counterfactually, would we  continue regarding a conventional cognitive state or process as mental if it  happened to lack the property in question? If the answer is "yes", then we should not exclude external elements just because they happen to lack that  feature. For example, if a lesion caused a person's memory to stop displaying  generation effects, would we stop treating this faculty as real memory? Presumably  not. Thus, (contra Rupert, 2004) generation effects are not essential for  memory.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Despite this sensible proposal, it is doubtful  that it can always break the stalemate. If, say, a person's beliefs were to lose  the property of first-person access, would they still count as real beliefs?  I suspect Clark would claim that they would (insisting that this  difference doesn't matter), whereas Preston would say they wouldn't (insisting this difference does matter).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">But even if Wheeler's strategy does help, there  is another worry raised by Rupert that deserved greater attention than  provided in this volume. Insofar as the adoption of EMH would still require  acknowledging the same critical distinctions between what is inner and what is outer,  between what is biological and what isn't, the worry is that the adoption of EMH  would amount to nothing more than a re-labeling. We now investigate the ways  minds interact with non-mental things like public words and symbols. An EMH revolution would involve the same divisions; we would just start talking  about investigating the ways the <i style="">biological parts </i>of our minds interact with the <i style="">non-biological parts</i> of our minds. Not much would change except the words we use.  This worry is substantially exacerbated when we turn to the essays promoting  the second goal of this volume. This is because those essays embrace (rather  than downplay) the distinctions between what's in the skull and what's  outside.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">With the type of EMH described thus far, both  sides have leaned upon the parity principle -- upon the functional similarity or dissimilarity of outer states and processes with conventional (i.e.,  inner, biological) cognitive states and processes to make their case either for  or against EMH. But there is a completely different outlook that forms the foundation of the second-wave perspective. The proponents of this new  outlook openly abandon the parity principle in favor of what one author (Sutton)  refers to as the "complementarity principle". This latter principle rejects the idea that external factors must be functionally similar to  conventional mental states and processes to qualify as cognitive. Instead, what  matters is <i style="">integration with</i> biological systems to form a broader, hybrid cognitive system. For these authors, Otto's  notebook isn't part of Otto's mind because it functions just like Otto's old  memory. Instead, it is part of his mind because it is systematically and  reciprocally <i style="">integrated </i>with his biological brain during various episodes of cognition. By replacing the parity principle  with the complementarity principle, proponents of second-wave EMH can simply side-step those critics who complain that what's extra-cranial is not functionally similar to what's intra-cranial.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Menary's own contribution, along with his  introduction, provides a clear articulation of second-wave EMH. He offers a task-based conception of a cognitive process which is then used to support an  externalist conception of cognitive systems. For him, what makes outer items truly cognitive is not parity but rather the distinctive roles they play in  the overall performance of a task that is cognitive in nature. If, say, the  task is doing long division with pencil and paper, then the pencil and paper  serve as components of an extended cognitive system, not because they resemble  something neurological when division is done in the head, but rather because they  are integral parts of a system performing a cognitive task: "The primary motivation for cognitive integration is the brute fact of our  embodiment, especially our bodily manipulation of environmental vehicles" (p. 229).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Along similar lines, John Sutton joins Menary in developing a second-wave EMH position. To illustrate his complementarity principle, Sutton discusses two historical examples. The first involves Elizabethan actors at the Globe theater, who were required to perform an incredibly large number of different roles with minimal rehearsal. This  was possible only because the physical lay-out of the sets, social  variables, and various props served as information-bearing elements that helped to  guide the actors' performance. The second example concerns the medieval memory  palaces used by monks and scholars for storing large amounts of information.  With this mnemonic strategy, buildings or familiar streets were memorized and then  used to store various bits of information for later retrieval. Sutton claims  this qualifies as a form of extended cognition, though I had a hard time understanding how it does. Given that the process involves everything  being internalized (with memorized images of spatial geography used as  mnemonic aids), just how this is supposed to support EMH is a bit mysterious.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Robert Wilson also offers an intriguing essay  that can be seen as supporting second-wave EMH, though he initially presents an  argument that appears to embrace parity. Wilson focuses upon "meaning making" -- our employment of various different internal and external  representational states and devices for various purposes. Just as developmental systems  theory helps us to see how various external factors contribute to organismic  inheritance and development, so too a proper understanding of our status as  "semantic engines" demands that we treat external symbols, signs, and linguistic tools as parts of our own cognitive apparatus. Ultimately, Wilson  suggests that the specific form or location of these "mental representations" is less important to our understanding of intentionality than the fact that  they play <i style="">some</i> sort of causal role in perception and behavior.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Language is also the focus of the chapter  authored by David Spurrett and Stephen Cowley, who regard language as an outgrowth  of more primitive "utterance activities". They propose that communicative gestures and acts sometimes give rise to a type of extended cognition in  which two communicators should not be viewed as two distinct individuals, but  rather as a complex hybrid. When a Zulu mother deliberately dominates the  perceptual and behavioral field of her infant to calm the child, Spurrett and  Cowley suggest the infant's mind is "colonized" by the mother's.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">All of these authors make a strong case for  thinking that various outer, non-biological elements that are markedly different from internal elements are nevertheless important (indeed, necessary) for  specific cognitive tasks and activities. They make a strong case for a high  degree of integration. Unfortunately, they fail to make a strong case for treating  these integrated external structures as parts of an expanded mind. There is  nothing here, as far as I can see, that would alleviate the worry that EMH is  based upon a coupling-constitution fallacy. We are repeatedly told how  second-wave EMH would be a dramatic departure from our current perspective and would  have radical new consequences for our conception of mentality, language  systems, reasoning, etc. On that we can all agree. But we are told much less  about why such a dramatic departure is a good idea, or just what the explanatory  pay-off would be.
  </p><p class="NDPRBodyTexT">What these authors need, but do not really provide, is an  argument for treating external structures as not only important for (and  integrated with) cognitive systems during various cognitive tasks -- something  Adams and Aizawa are happy to concede -- but for also treating them as actually  mental states. Why, for example, should the actor's stage artifacts and props  be treated as elements of an expanded cognitive system, instead of as, more conventionally, non-cognitive mnemonic tools that aid the actor's  memory? Sutton doesn't really tell us. Menary offers the proposal that external elements are not mere tools because biological minds act upon them and  vice versa -- that they are reciprocally integrated with one another. But  that is hardly a convincing justification for thinking something is part of  something else (when chopping wood, I am reciprocally integrated with an ax, but  that doesn't make the ax part of me). At least with first-wave EMH and the  parity principle, there was an intuitive response to the coupling-constitution criticism: outer elements are not mere tools because, in certain  circumstances, there is no relevant difference in their functional role and the role of internal elements; hence, treating their location as relevant is a mere prejudice. But with second-wave EMH and its abandonment of the parity  principle, a key justification for <i style="">not</i> regarding external structures as non-systemic aids is lost. In large measure, the  essays supporting second-wave EMH in this volume do not answer the coupling-constitution fallacy so much as they simply ignore it.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">How could one show that something is a <i style="">real</i> part of a system, as opposed to merely being causally integrated with it? What sort of distinction is  this? Is it objectively real, or is it instead some sort of construct? It is  unfortunate that these types of meta-questions don't receive further attention here. Moreover, it is surprising that none of the authors offer either a  defense or critique of EMH that appeals to a broader analysis of systems. After  all, there are lots of biological systems associated with our selves that are  equally plausible candidates for extension. Is an asthmatic's inhaler part of  her respiratory system or merely an aid to it? How should one try to answer  such a question and what counts as getting it right? Consider what the parity  principle might look like applied to our digestion system:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">If, as we confront  some task, a part of the world functions as a process which, <i style="">were it done  in our gut</i>, we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the digestive process, then that part of the world <i style="">is</i> . . . part of the digestive process.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Suppose our evolutionary history had been quite  different and we had evolved blenders as part of our biological digestive tract.  It seems clear that if blending was part of our natural digestive process, we  would have no hesitation in recognizing biological blending as part of our  digestive system. But that counterfactual truth in no way tempts me to think that  the blender on my kitchen counter should now count as <i style="">part of</i>  my digestive system. Why should cognition be treated any differently? Many of the debates that take center stage in this volume  lead to no clear resolution in part because basic questions like these are not  properly addressed.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Nearly all of the essays discussed so far focus  upon the intentional aspect of cognition -- on representational states like  memories and beliefs. The phenomenal aspect of the mind has received much less  attention in the EMH literature, and in their original essay Clark and Chalmers were  careful to avoid claiming that consciousness itself might be located beyond the  skull. But two of the most intriguing essays in this collection do not shy away  from that proposal.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In her lengthy and complicated contribution,  Susan Hurley offers a framework for EMH that distinguishes "What" from "How" externalism, and "Content" from "Quality" externalism. This taxonomy helps her to expose an important and  interesting paradox that is the focal point of her essay. Given that there is a  large intuitive gap between our understanding of brains and qualitative  experience (where we can't really see how the former can instantiate the latter),  then why is there such a strong intuition that qualitative experience must be  entirely realized by what is inside the skull? As she puts it: "if we have so  little understanding of how phenomenal qualities could possibly be explained,  why are we so confident that if they can be, the explanation must be  internalist?" (p. 145). Hurley offers a diagnosis of this paradox that aims to make externalism toward phenomenal states more palatable. By focusing on  perceptual examples where external factors determine the classification of specific qualitative properties (where neural correlates of specific qualia can  vary), Hurley argues that external factors are essential to explaining the  'what-it's-likeness' of perceptual states. While this was perhaps the most demanding chapter  in the collection, there is much here that makes the effort worthwhile.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Mark Rowlands' careful yet somewhat cryptic  essay also promotes the view that conscious experience is at least partially  realized in elements that extend beyond the nervous system. Rowlands notes that  while standard accounts of phenomenal experience appeal to modes of  presentation, they overlook that such a mode has a dual role -- as an object of  apprehension, but also as a vehicle or "enabler" of that experience (much like Frege's dual-role notion of sense). To clarify his position, Rowlands  invokes Merleau-Ponty's example of a blind man using a cane. Much of the time,  the cane itself is not an object of perception -- it is instead a "vehicle" of perceptual experience used to detect objects, as a conduit of the  blind's man's phenomenal experience of the world. In similar fashion, Rowlands  suggests that saccadic eye scans, "attention-grabbing" mechanisms, and spatial patterns of light also serve as vehicles by which the world is revealed.  While Rowland's suggestions are intriguing, his arguments for thinking<b style=""> </b>either that modes of presentations can serve as unapprehended vehicles of conscious experience or that they can  be instantiated by things like saccadic eye movements are far from clear.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Finally, undoubtedly the oddest chapter is this  volume is one that inadvertently suggests that the whole topic is deeply  ill-conceived. In a somewhat condescending tone, Don Ross and James Ladyman tell us  that that the coupling-constitution fallacy is based upon a naive and flawed  conception of reality, since, at the level of fundamental physics, conventional  notions like causation and constitution have no real application. Curiously,  they see this as only a problem for the critics of EMH. Given that EMH itself  depends on the idea that certain things are parts of other things (minds), their conclusion should have been that EMH is itself a confused non-issue (presumably, their essay isn't "part of" a volume devoted to such a non-issue). Perhaps the real take-home lesson from this chapter is  something most of us already believed; namely, that whatever bizarre things  physicists tell us about fundamental particles, their statements should have very  little bearing on what we think about middle-sized things like cognitive  systems.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Beyond these concerns about the individual  chapters, it should be noted that there is no discernible organizational scheme  behind the ordering of the essays. While the topics may not lend themselves to any obvious sequence, it would have helped if the editor had used the introduction  to explain why he adopted the arrangement he did.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Yet despite this and the other concerns  mentioned above, this collection is hardly a flop. Quite the contrary, it is easily the  most broad-themed and diverse book on the topic of extended cognition.  Indeed, one of its greatest virtues may be that it presents so many of the different  ways people think about EMH. Insofar as some of those ways have problems that  have not yet been addressed, it is enormously beneficial to have these  brought to light. Menary's collection does enhance our understanding of extended  minds and will thus significantly advance the discussion, though perhaps in ways  that were not directly intended.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style="">References<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Rupert, Robert (2004): "Challenges to the  Hypothesis of Extended Cognition." <i style="">Journal of Philosophy</i>, 101(8), 389-428.</p>
