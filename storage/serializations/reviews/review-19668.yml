content: "\xE2\x80\x80<p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Introduction<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Grounding Concepts</span></i><span style=\"\"> by Carrie Jenkins is an ambitious work in the epistemology of arithmetic. It should be of interest to anyone working  in the philosophy of mathematics or on the nature of the <i style=\"\">a priori</i>  more generally. The aim of the book<i style=\"\"> </i>is to sketch an  account of our knowledge of simple arithmetical truths that is compatible with three theses. First, arithmetical realism  is correct in that the truths of arithmetic obtain independently of our  minds. Second, arithmetic is an <i style=\"\">a priori</i> discipline in the sense that arithmetical truths can be known without  reliance on empirical evidence. Third, empiricism is correct in the sense that  all knowledge of the mind-independent world ultimately rests upon sense  experience. Jenkins' central idea is that experience does not play an evidential  role in supporting our arithmetical beliefs but instead plays a very different  kind of epistemic role. On her view, simple arithmetical truths are conceptual  truths -- they can be known on the basis of examining our arithmetical  concepts. Yet the competent examination of concepts does not always yield knowledge.  For a competent conceptual examination to yield knowledge, the relevant  concepts must be <span class=\"SpellE\">epistemically</span> privileged -- what Jenkins  calls \"grounded\". The role of experience, then, is not to provide evidence for our arithmetical beliefs but to ground our arithmetical concepts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">I think highly of this book. <i style=\"\">Grounding Concepts</i> adds a genuinely new option to the philosophical landscape. The central idea --  that sense experience may be relevant to the epistemic status of concepts and  thus play a non-evidential role in explaining knowledge -- is <span class=\"GramE\">both</span> sensible and clever. The book is sophisticated and accessible, both  extremely careful and extremely clear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Grounding Concepts </span></i><span style=\"\">primarily focuses on the big picture. This is both <span class=\"GramE\">a strength</span> and a weakness of the work.  It is <span class=\"GramE\">a strength</span> in that the book is able to  avoid distracting technicalities. It is also able to remain neutral on many puzzling  issues in the philosophy of mathematics. This helps to make the general structure  of the proposal clear. On the other hand, the high level of abstraction makes  it difficult to evaluate how promising the book's strategy for explaining  our arithmetical knowledge really is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Grounding Concepts</span></i><span style=\"\"> is divided into three parts, each three chapters long. The first part lays the groundwork for the proposed  account of arithmetical knowledge. In the first chapter, Jenkins provides a  sophisticated discussion of various <span class=\"SpellE\">construals</span> of realism  and argues that realism is best understood in terms of essence rather than  necessity. In the second chapter, Jenkins discusses contemporary accounts of <i style=\"\">a priori</i> knowledge. In particular, she considers and rejects the views of <span class=\"SpellE\">Boghossian</span>,  <span class=\"SpellE\">Peacocke</span>, <span class=\"SpellE\">Bealer</span>,  and Field. This discussion provides a helpful addition to the literature on these views.  The third chapter proposes a novel externalist account of knowledge. In  rough outline, the idea is that a thinker knows that p just in case the  thinker's belief that p can be well explained to an outsider -- someone unaware of  the details of the thinker's situation -- just by citing the fact that p.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The second part of the book presents and develops the account of our knowledge of simple arithmetical truths. The majority of chapter four concerns the nature of concepts and conceptual truth. On Jenkins' view, a concept counts as  grounded if it non-accidentally represents some feature of reality. Grounded  concepts yield conceptual truths: any belief arrived at via the competent  conceptual examination of grounded concepts counts as knowledge. The remainder of  chapter four and chapter five apply this account to the particular case of  arithmetic. Our arithmetical concepts, such as the concepts <i style=\"\">7</i>,<i style=\"\"> +</i>, <i style=\"\">5</i>, <i style=\"\">=</i>, and<i style=\"\"> 12</i>, are grounded by sense experience. Simple arithmetical truths, such as the truth that 7+5=12,  are believed on the basis of competent examination of our arithmetical  concepts. This explains how we have <i style=\"\">a priori</i> knowledge of such truths. Chapter six considers related philosophical  projects and distinguishes Jenkins' approach from these alternatives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The third part of the book discusses several objections to the account of concept  grounding and the account of arithmetical knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The main positive contributions of <i style=\"\">Grounding Concepts </i>come in chapters three through five, with the presentation of a novel  externalist theory of knowledge, an account of conceptual truth, and a theory of our knowledge of simple arithmetical truths. It is worth discussing each of  these three proposals in greater detail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Theory of Knowledge<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins' account of knowledge is put forward as a plausible externalist theory that does not immediately rule out the possibility of <i style=\"\">a priori</i> knowledge of mind-independent truths (unlike, for instance,  some versions of the causal theory of knowledge). The account is also  advertised as immune to <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettier</span> counterexamples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins' account is <span class=\"SpellE\">explanationist</span>. The rough idea is that S  knows that p just in case S believes that p, p is true, the fact that p explains S's  belief that p, and the explanatory connection is of the right sort -- that is,  it is \"normal\". (The view is thus related to the accounts of Alan Goldman and Steven <span class=\"SpellE\">Rieber</span>.) The novel part of  Jenkins' account is her treatment of normal explanatory connections. Here,  Jenkins appeals to the idea of an outsider -- a rational thinker who is aware of commonplace facts about persons and their mental lives but is not aware  of special facts about S or S's particular situation. The idea is that in  the case of a normal connection, there is nothing unusual about the situation  that would need to be mentioned to an outsider in the course of an explanation of  S's belief that p. It would not be misleading to leave out the details and  simply cite the fact that p. On Jenkins' view, then, S knows that p just in  case citing p would provide an outsider with a good explanation of S's belief  that p.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">In thinking about this part of the book, one may wonder why Jenkins' discussion is so  heavily focused on knowledge, and in particular, on <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettier</span> cases. It seems to me that the central puzzles in the epistemology of arithmetic do not directly concern knowledge. One puzzle is to explain  how it is that our beliefs about arithmetic are true given that the truths of arithmetic are independent of us. This is a form of the Benacerraf-Field problem for arithmetical Platonism. A second puzzle is to explain how it  is that we are justified -- or to use Jenkins' phrase, \"rationally respectable\" -- in holding our arithmetical beliefs. The explanation of our arithmetical knowledge <i style=\"\">per se</i> seems far less pressing. While there are plausible examples of <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettier</span> cases for arithmetic, such cases seem  relatively marginal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Be that as it may, it is worthwhile to consider the plausibility of Jenkins' account as a  general account of knowledge. As advertised, the account is better suited to  explain the possibility of <i style=\"\">a priori </i>knowledge than the causal theory. However, Jenkins' account seems to have many of  the same counterexamples as more familiar externalist theories. For example, consider a version of <span class=\"SpellE\">Ginet's</span> Fake Barn  Country scenario:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\">Suppose  that, unbeknownst to him, Henry is in an area in which the majority of structures that look like barns are mere barn facades.  Suppose that Henry sees a genuine barn from a distance and thereby comes to believe  that he is standing in front of a barn.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Intuitively, Henry does not know that he is standing in front of a barn. However, Jenkins'  account seems to deliver the wrong result. It would not be misleading to tell  the outsider that Henry believes that he is in front of a barn because he is  in front of a barn. The fact that he is in Fake Barn Country is irrelevant  to the explanation of Henry's belief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">This scenario provides an apparent counterexample to the sufficiency of Jenkins'  account. There are also apparent counterexamples to its necessity. Consider, for instance, a case of <span class=\"SpellE\">overdetermination</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\">Suppose  that Edgar knows that Allan has taken a fatal dose of poison and that enough time has passed that Allan must be dead. In fact, Allan is  dead. However, unbeknownst to Edgar, Allan died because he ran into the street  after taking the poison and was promptly run over by a bus.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Intuitively, Edgar knows that Allan is dead. But presumably Edgar's belief that Allan is  dead would not be well explained to an outsider simply by citing the fact  that Allan is dead. This would be a misleading explanation; it would mislead the  outsider into thinking that Edgar had a correct belief as to the cause of Allan's  death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">To handle these apparent counterexamples, Jenkins might appeal to a distinction she  draws between two kinds of unusual explanatory factors. She distinguishes  unusual <i style=\"\">features</i> of an explanatory connection from unusual <i style=\"\">kinds</i> of explanatory connections. She further claims that unusual features do not need to be  cited in an explanation to avoid misleading one's audience, while unusual  kinds of explanatory connections do. Making use of this distinction, Jenkins  might argue that in the Fake Barn Country case, the failure of knowledge stems from  the fact that there is an unusual kind of explanatory <span class=\"GramE\">link,</span> while in the Edgar-Allan case there is only an unusual feature of the explanatory link.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">However, insofar as I understand Jenkins' distinction, this diagnosis seems to get things  the wrong way around. In the Fake Barn Country case, the relevant belief is based  on veridical perception, an ordinary kind of explanatory link. It is the  other features of the situation that are somewhat unusual. In the Edgar-Allan  scenario, the explanatory link is what is unusual. So it is not obvious that  Jenkins' account can easily answer these apparent counterexamples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Having raised these concerns, I should also highlight the fact that Jenkins' discussion of knowledge makes a genuine contribution to the literature. The strategy  of appealing to what can be left out of explanations is both novel and  clever. It strikes me as a promising avenue to explore in approaching the problem  of distinguishing between normal and non-normal explanatory chains -- an  issue that arises in many different areas of philosophy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Concepts and  Conceptual Truth</span></i><span style=\"\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Let me now turn to Jenkins' account of concepts and conceptual truth. On Jenkins' view,  just as beliefs have epistemic properties, so too do concepts. In particular,  just as beliefs can count as true or false, justified or unjustified, or  knowledge or non-knowledge, concepts can count as accurate or inaccurate, justified  or unjustified, or grounded or ungrounded. Indeed, the corresponding  properties of concepts and beliefs are closely analogous. A belief counts as knowledge  just in case it is true and there is nothing accidental about its being true. Analogously, a concept counts as grounded just in case it is accurate  and there is nothing accidental about its being accurate. (More precisely, by  analogy with her account of knowledge, Jenkins claims that a thinker's concept  is grounded just in case the thinker's possession of the concept can be  well explained to an outsider just by citing the fact that the concept is  accurate.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The discussion of the epistemic properties of concepts is tied to the account of  conceptual truth. According to Jenkins, there is a process of investigating or  examining one's concepts. The epistemic status of the beliefs resulting from this  process depends on the epistemic status of the relevant concepts. In particular,  the competent conceptual examination of accurate concepts yields true  beliefs. The competent conceptual examination of justified concepts yields justified beliefs. The competent conceptual examination of grounded concepts  yields knowledge -- that is, conceptual truths.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">This is an elegant account.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins makes an additional claim about concept grounding that is worth noting. She  claims that concepts can only be grounded in ways that involve the senses. This is,  in part, why her view ends up being a form of empiricism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">There are two issues that I would like to raise regarding this account. The first  concerns the notion of concept grounding. I agree with Jenkins that there can be <span class=\"SpellE\">epistemically</span> defective concepts that do not give  rise to conceptual truths. (Prior's example of <span class=\"SpellE\"><i style=\"\">tonk</i></span>  and <span class=\"SpellE\">Dummett's</span> example of <span class=\"SpellE\"><i style=\"\">boche</i></span> are potential examples.) But it is less clear to me that there can be  concepts that are defective in the same way <span class=\"GramE\">that <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettiered</span> beliefs</span> are defective. For instance, suppose that someone is  implanted with a new accurate concept by a benevolent neuroscientist. Do we really  want to say that the thinker's concept is defective in that its competent examination cannot yield knowledge? I do not find this obvious. In  supporting Jenkins' view, it would be helpful to have an intuitive case of a  thinker who forms a justified true belief that is not knowledge on the basis of a  competent conceptual examination of an ungrounded concept. That is to say, it  would be helpful to have a clear example of a <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettier</span>  case for concepts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The second issue concerns Jenkins' empiricism. Jenkins claims that concepts can only be  grounded on the basis of sense experience. But it is not obvious that this is  correct given the rest of her views. Suppose that a thinker is hardwired to  acquire and retain a given concept no matter what. Suppose that there is an  evolutionary explanation of this fact: the thinker's ancestors were selected for  possessing this concept because it was advantageous to do so in their environment. Suppose, too, possessing the concept was advantageous because it  accurately represents some important feature of reality. It seems to me that in  such a case we should say that the concept is grounded. This is so despite the  fact that its possession does not depend on sense experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins briefly discusses this issue and argues that such a concept should not count as grounded, since \"epistemic sensitivity to the world is normally thought  of as occurring at the level of individuals, not at the level of species\"  (p. 234). Thus, she argues, it would be misleading to tell an outsider that  the thinker possesses the concept because it is accurate. I do not find this  line of thought fully persuasive. An evolutionary explanation of the presence  of some trait is an ordinary kind of explanation, one that should be  unsurprising to an outsider. Moreover, since it is an open empirical possibility that  some of our arithmetical or logical concepts are actually hardwired in this  way, we should be open to the possibility that concepts can be grounded not on  the basis of experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">I don't think, however, that this poses a problem for Jenkins' account of concept  grounding. Rather, I suspect that it is the empiricism that ought to be modified.  Jenkins claims that we have a strong pre-theoretic intuition that empiricism is  true. I don't share that intuition. Empiricism seems to me to be a theoretical commitment that is primarily motivated by a commitment to naturalism.  Since the existence of evolved hardwired concepts is compatible with a general naturalistic worldview, there seems little cost in rejecting a strictly empiricist view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins' account of concept grounding thus seems better suited to playing a role in the  defense of a realist, <i style=\"\">a priori</i>, and naturalist theory of arithmetical knowledge. Insofar as these three theses are independently plausible, this is a valuable contribution to make.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">The Epistemology of  Arithmetic</span></i><span style=\"\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">We're now in a position to examine Jenkins' account of our knowledge of arithmetic. On  her view, our knowledge of simple arithmetical truths, such as our knowledge  of the fact that 7+5=12, is explained as follows: The external world has  arithmetical structure. Our sense experience -- what Jenkins calls \"<span class=\"SpellE\">unconceptualized</span> sensory input\" -- is generated by our interaction with the world. This sensory input also has arithmetical structure that corresponds to the arithmetical structure of the world. The arithmetical structure of our experience is what grounds our arithmetical concepts. There are at least  two possible ways in which our arithmetical concepts may be grounded. We may  have acquired these concepts on the basis of our sensory input -- \"the camera-brain hypothesis\". Alternatively, these concepts may have been innately acquired but retained due to their usefulness when applied to  sensory input -- the \"filter-brain hypothesis\". We form simple arithmetical beliefs, such as the belief that 7+5=12, on the basis of conducting  competent investigations of our arithmetical concepts. Since our arithmetical  concepts are grounded, these simple arithmetical beliefs count as knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">This strikes me as a promising strategy for explaining our knowledge of arithmetic (and  perhaps other <i style=\"\">a priori </i>domains). But it is difficult to evaluate whether it ultimately can be made to work. One  issue concerns the parts of arithmetic that go beyond simple equations. We  don't only want to explain how we know that 7+5=12. We also want to explain our  knowledge of various generalizations -- for instance, that every number has a  successor, that addition is commutative, and that the principle of mathematical  induction is true. For the proposed strategy to explain this general knowledge,  our sensory input must have a rich arithmetical structure. (Or,  alternatively, sensory input with a meager arithmetical structure must be able to  ground sophisticated arithmetical concepts.) It would be helpful to have some indication of how this story might go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Even for the case of 7+5=12, it would be useful to have a better sense of the details of  the account. For instance, I'm not entirely sure what it is for the world to  have arithmetical structure. Does it suffice that the <span class=\"GramE\">world contain</span> objects? I'm not sure what it is for our sensory input to  have arithmetical structure. Presumably, the arithmetical structure of our  sensory input is whatever it is that explains why arithmetical concepts are  useful in organizing our experience. But it is not clear to me just what that  comes to. I'm also not sure how the structure of our sensory input is supposed to  ground even simple arithmetical concepts. In order to have a better sense of  whether Jenkins' account can explain our arithmetical knowledge, it would be  helpful to have a toy model that shows how the details might be filled in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">A different issue with Jenkins' account concerns whether it can really explain the <i style=\"\">a priori</i> status of our arithmetical knowledge. Suppose (for simplicity) that the world had turned out to be Newtonian. Suppose that we possessed the Newtonian concepts of <i style=\"\">force</i>, <i style=\"\">mass</i>, and <i style=\"\">acceleration</i>, and that these concepts were grounded by our sense experience. It is  plausible that the competent examination of the Newtonian concepts will yield the  belief that F=MA. On Jenkins' view, then, this belief would count as <i style=\"\">a priori</i> knowledge. Indeed, this scenario exactly parallels Jenkins' account of our actual knowledge that 7+5=12. But this is intuitively wrong. Even in the described scenario,  the belief that F=MA should count as <i style=\"\">a posteriori</i>. At the very least, there is a significant intuitive  difference between that piece of knowledge and our knowledge that 7+5=12. It is not  clear whether the account has the resources to explain this difference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Higher-Order  Knowledge<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Let me now turn to one last interesting issue that is discussed by Jenkins. This is the  status of higher-order knowledge -- for instance, the knowledge that certain  beliefs count as justified or knowledge, and the knowledge that certain concepts  count as justified or grounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">How do we know that our arithmetical concepts are justified? In answering this question,  Jenkins appeals to the indispensability of these concepts. Our arithmetical  concepts are useful in categorizing, predicting, and explaining our experience.  Indeed, our arithmetical concepts are indispensable to our best scientific  theories of the world. This provides us with <i style=\"\">a posteriori </i>evidence that our arithmetical concepts are justified. On  the basis of this evidence, we can come to know that our arithmetical  concepts are justified and (derivatively) that our simple arithmetical beliefs are justified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">While I see the intuitive pull of this view, it strikes me as a somewhat uncomfortable  position to adopt. On Jenkins' view, we are justified in believing simple  arithmetical truths on the basis of examining our concepts, but we are justified in believing that we are so justified on the basis of investigating what is indispensable to our scientific theories of the world. This is an  awkward juxtaposition of views.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">That is Jenkins' view on our knowledge of justification. What about our knowledge of  knowledge? Jenkins suggests that we cannot have any such knowledge. We cannot know  that we know arithmetical truths or that our arithmetical concepts are grounded.  She writes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\">All  we can do in the case of belief is to say which of our beliefs we think are justified, and assume that most or all of these are knowledge.  By the same token, all we can do in the case of concepts is say which of our  concepts<i style=\"\"> </i>we think are justified, and assume that most or all of these are grounded. (p. 144)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Thus, Jenkins seems to endorse a skeptical view about knowledge of knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Presumably, the background thought here concerns truth and accuracy: We cannot \"tell  from the inside\" that our arithmetical beliefs are true or that our arithmetical concepts accurately represent genuine features of reality.  So we cannot know that our arithmetical beliefs count as knowledge or that our arithmetical concepts count as grounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">This also strikes me as an uncomfortable position to adopt. Skepticism about higher-order knowledge is intuitively implausible; it seems intuitive that we know  that we know that 7+5=12. Moreover, it is difficult to see how this position  fits with the rest of Jenkins' views. On Jenkins' account, we can know that 7+5=12  on the basis of examining our arithmetical concepts. Presumably, we can know  that we believe that 7+5=12 on the basis of introspection. So why can't we put  this knowledge together and come to know that our arithmetical belief is  true? And if we can do that, and we can also come to know that our belief is  justified, why can't we know that we know that 7+5=12? It is difficult to see what additional bar there could be to our knowledge of our knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Conclusion<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">These critical remarks notwithstanding, <i style=\"\">Grounding Concepts</i> is an excellent book. It provides a sophisticated and clear discussion  of a difficult nest of issues in the philosophy of mathematics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics. By developing a new theoretical  option, it makes a significant contribution to the literature on the epistemology  of the <i style=\"\">a priori</i>.

Third, empiricism is correct in the sense that  all knowledge of the mind-independent world ultimately rests upon sense  experience. Jenkins' central idea is that experience does not play an evidential  role in supporting our arithmetical beliefs but instead plays a very different  kind of epistemic role. On her view, simple arithmetical truths are conceptual  truths -- they can be known on the basis of examining our arithmetical  concepts. Yet the competent examination of concepts does not always yield knowledge.  For a competent conceptual examination to yield knowledge, the relevant  concepts must be <span class=\"SpellE\">epistemically</span> privileged -- what Jenkins  calls \"grounded\". The role of experience, then, is not to provide evidence for our arithmetical beliefs but to ground our arithmetical concepts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">I think highly of this book. <i style=\"\">Grounding Concepts</i> adds a genuinely new option to the philosophical landscape. The central idea --  that sense experience may be relevant to the epistemic status of concepts and  thus play a non-evidential role in explaining knowledge -- is <span class=\"GramE\">both</span> sensible and clever. The book is sophisticated and accessible, both  extremely careful and extremely clear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Grounding Concepts </span></i><span style=\"\">primarily focuses on the big picture. This is both <span class=\"GramE\">a strength</span> and a weakness of the work.  It is <span class=\"GramE\">a strength</span> in that the book is able to  avoid distracting technicalities. It is also able to remain neutral on many puzzling  issues in the philosophy of mathematics. This helps to make the general structure  of the proposal clear. On the other hand, the high level of abstraction makes  it difficult to evaluate how promising the book's strategy for explaining  our arithmetical knowledge really is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Grounding Concepts</span></i><span style=\"\"> is divided into three parts, each three chapters long. The first part lays the groundwork for the proposed  account of arithmetical knowledge. In the first chapter, Jenkins provides a  sophisticated discussion of various <span class=\"SpellE\">construals</span> of realism  and argues that realism is best understood in terms of essence rather than  necessity. In the second chapter, Jenkins discusses contemporary accounts of <i style=\"\">a priori</i> knowledge. In particular, she considers and rejects the views of <span class=\"SpellE\">Boghossian</span>,  <span class=\"SpellE\">Peacocke</span>, <span class=\"SpellE\">Bealer</span>,  and Field. This discussion provides a helpful addition to the literature on these views.  The third chapter proposes a novel externalist account of knowledge. In  rough outline, the idea is that a thinker knows that p just in case the  thinker's belief that p can be well explained to an outsider -- someone unaware of  the details of the thinker's situation -- just by citing the fact that p.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The second part of the book presents and develops the account of our knowledge of simple arithmetical truths. The majority of chapter four concerns the nature of concepts and conceptual truth. On Jenkins' view, a concept counts as  grounded if it non-accidentally represents some feature of reality. Grounded  concepts yield conceptual truths: any belief arrived at via the competent  conceptual examination of grounded concepts counts as knowledge. The remainder of  chapter four and chapter five apply this account to the particular case of  arithmetic. Our arithmetical concepts, such as the concepts <i style=\"\">7</i>,<i style=\"\"> +</i>, <i style=\"\">5</i>, <i style=\"\">=</i>, and<i style=\"\"> 12</i>, are grounded by sense experience. Simple arithmetical truths, such as the truth that 7+5=12,  are believed on the basis of competent examination of our arithmetical  concepts. This explains how we have <i style=\"\">a priori</i> knowledge of such truths. Chapter six considers related philosophical  projects and distinguishes Jenkins' approach from these alternatives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The third part of the book discusses several objections to the account of concept  grounding and the account of arithmetical knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The main positive contributions of <i style=\"\">Grounding Concepts </i>come in chapters three through five, with the presentation of a novel  externalist theory of knowledge, an account of conceptual truth, and a theory of our knowledge of simple arithmetical truths. It is worth discussing each of  these three proposals in greater detail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Theory of Knowledge<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins' account of knowledge is put forward as a plausible externalist theory that does not immediately rule out the possibility of <i style=\"\">a priori</i> knowledge of mind-independent truths (unlike, for instance,  some versions of the causal theory of knowledge). The account is also  advertised as immune to <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettier</span> counterexamples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins' account is <span class=\"SpellE\">explanationist</span>. The rough idea is that S  knows that p just in case S believes that p, p is true, the fact that p explains S's  belief that p, and the explanatory connection is of the right sort -- that is,  it is \"normal\". (The view is thus related to the accounts of Alan Goldman and Steven <span class=\"SpellE\">Rieber</span>.) The novel part of  Jenkins' account is her treatment of normal explanatory connections. Here,  Jenkins appeals to the idea of an outsider -- a rational thinker who is aware of commonplace facts about persons and their mental lives but is not aware  of special facts about S or S's particular situation. The idea is that in  the case of a normal connection, there is nothing unusual about the situation  that would need to be mentioned to an outsider in the course of an explanation of  S's belief that p. It would not be misleading to leave out the details and  simply cite the fact that p. On Jenkins' view, then, S knows that p just in  case citing p would provide an outsider with a good explanation of S's belief  that p.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">In thinking about this part of the book, one may wonder why Jenkins' discussion is so  heavily focused on knowledge, and in particular, on <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettier</span> cases. It seems to me that the central puzzles in the epistemology of arithmetic do not directly concern knowledge. One puzzle is to explain  how it is that our beliefs about arithmetic are true given that the truths of arithmetic are independent of us. This is a form of the Benacerraf-Field problem for arithmetical Platonism. A second puzzle is to explain how it  is that we are justified -- or to use Jenkins' phrase, \"rationally respectable\" -- in holding our arithmetical beliefs. The explanation of our arithmetical knowledge <i style=\"\">per se</i> seems far less pressing. While there are plausible examples of <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettier</span> cases for arithmetic, such cases seem  relatively marginal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Be that as it may, it is worthwhile to consider the plausibility of Jenkins' account as a  general account of knowledge. As advertised, the account is better suited to  explain the possibility of <i style=\"\">a priori </i>knowledge than the causal theory. However, Jenkins' account seems to have many of  the same counterexamples as more familiar externalist theories. For example, consider a version of <span class=\"SpellE\">Ginet's</span> Fake Barn  Country scenario:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\">Suppose  that, unbeknownst to him, Henry is in an area in which the majority of structures that look like barns are mere barn facades.  Suppose that Henry sees a genuine barn from a distance and thereby comes to believe  that he is standing in front of a barn.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Intuitively, Henry does not know that he is standing in front of a barn. However, Jenkins'  account seems to deliver the wrong result. It would not be misleading to tell  the outsider that Henry believes that he is in front of a barn because he is  in front of a barn. The fact that he is in Fake Barn Country is irrelevant  to the explanation of Henry's belief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">This scenario provides an apparent counterexample to the sufficiency of Jenkins'  account. There are also apparent counterexamples to its necessity. Consider, for instance, a case of <span class=\"SpellE\">overdetermination</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\">Suppose  that Edgar knows that Allan has taken a fatal dose of poison and that enough time has passed that Allan must be dead. In fact, Allan is  dead. However, unbeknownst to Edgar, Allan died because he ran into the street  after taking the poison and was promptly run over by a bus.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Intuitively, Edgar knows that Allan is dead. But presumably Edgar's belief that Allan is  dead would not be well explained to an outsider simply by citing the fact  that Allan is dead. This would be a misleading explanation; it would mislead the  outsider into thinking that Edgar had a correct belief as to the cause of Allan's  death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">To handle these apparent counterexamples, Jenkins might appeal to a distinction she  draws between two kinds of unusual explanatory factors. She distinguishes  unusual <i style=\"\">features</i> of an explanatory connection from unusual <i style=\"\">kinds</i> of explanatory connections. She further claims that unusual features do not need to be  cited in an explanation to avoid misleading one's audience, while unusual  kinds of explanatory connections do. Making use of this distinction, Jenkins  might argue that in the Fake Barn Country case, the failure of knowledge stems from  the fact that there is an unusual kind of explanatory <span class=\"GramE\">link,</span> while in the Edgar-Allan case there is only an unusual feature of the explanatory link.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">However, insofar as I understand Jenkins' distinction, this diagnosis seems to get things  the wrong way around. In the Fake Barn Country case, the relevant belief is based  on veridical perception, an ordinary kind of explanatory link. It is the  other features of the situation that are somewhat unusual. In the Edgar-Allan  scenario, the explanatory link is what is unusual. So it is not obvious that  Jenkins' account can easily answer these apparent counterexamples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Having raised these concerns, I should also highlight the fact that Jenkins' discussion of knowledge makes a genuine contribution to the literature. The strategy  of appealing to what can be left out of explanations is both novel and  clever. It strikes me as a promising avenue to explore in approaching the problem  of distinguishing between normal and non-normal explanatory chains -- an  issue that arises in many different areas of philosophy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Concepts and  Conceptual Truth</span></i><span style=\"\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Let me now turn to Jenkins' account of concepts and conceptual truth. On Jenkins' view,  just as beliefs have epistemic properties, so too do concepts. In particular,  just as beliefs can count as true or false, justified or unjustified, or  knowledge or non-knowledge, concepts can count as accurate or inaccurate, justified  or unjustified, or grounded or ungrounded. Indeed, the corresponding  properties of concepts and beliefs are closely analogous. A belief counts as knowledge  just in case it is true and there is nothing accidental about its being true. Analogously, a concept counts as grounded just in case it is accurate  and there is nothing accidental about its being accurate. (More precisely, by  analogy with her account of knowledge, Jenkins claims that a thinker's concept  is grounded just in case the thinker's possession of the concept can be  well explained to an outsider just by citing the fact that the concept is  accurate.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The discussion of the epistemic properties of concepts is tied to the account of  conceptual truth. According to Jenkins, there is a process of investigating or  examining one's concepts. The epistemic status of the beliefs resulting from this  process depends on the epistemic status of the relevant concepts. In particular,  the competent conceptual examination of accurate concepts yields true  beliefs. The competent conceptual examination of justified concepts yields justified beliefs. The competent conceptual examination of grounded concepts  yields knowledge -- that is, conceptual truths.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">This is an elegant account.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins makes an additional claim about concept grounding that is worth noting. She  claims that concepts can only be grounded in ways that involve the senses. This is,  in part, why her view ends up being a form of empiricism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">There are two issues that I would like to raise regarding this account. The first  concerns the notion of concept grounding. I agree with Jenkins that there can be <span class=\"SpellE\">epistemically</span> defective concepts that do not give  rise to conceptual truths. (Prior's example of <span class=\"SpellE\"><i style=\"\">tonk</i></span>  and <span class=\"SpellE\">Dummett's</span> example of <span class=\"SpellE\"><i style=\"\">boche</i></span> are potential examples.) But it is less clear to me that there can be  concepts that are defective in the same way <span class=\"GramE\">that <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettiered</span> beliefs</span> are defective. For instance, suppose that someone is  implanted with a new accurate concept by a benevolent neuroscientist. Do we really  want to say that the thinker's concept is defective in that its competent examination cannot yield knowledge? I do not find this obvious. In  supporting Jenkins' view, it would be helpful to have an intuitive case of a  thinker who forms a justified true belief that is not knowledge on the basis of a  competent conceptual examination of an ungrounded concept. That is to say, it  would be helpful to have a clear example of a <span class=\"SpellE\">Gettier</span>  case for concepts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The second issue concerns Jenkins' empiricism. Jenkins claims that concepts can only be  grounded on the basis of sense experience. But it is not obvious that this is  correct given the rest of her views. Suppose that a thinker is hardwired to  acquire and retain a given concept no matter what. Suppose that there is an  evolutionary explanation of this fact: the thinker's ancestors were selected for  possessing this concept because it was advantageous to do so in their environment. Suppose, too, possessing the concept was advantageous because it  accurately represents some important feature of reality. It seems to me that in  such a case we should say that the concept is grounded. This is so despite the  fact that its possession does not depend on sense experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins briefly discusses this issue and argues that such a concept should not count as grounded, since \"epistemic sensitivity to the world is normally thought  of as occurring at the level of individuals, not at the level of species\"  (p. 234). Thus, she argues, it would be misleading to tell an outsider that  the thinker possesses the concept because it is accurate. I do not find this  line of thought fully persuasive. An evolutionary explanation of the presence  of some trait is an ordinary kind of explanation, one that should be  unsurprising to an outsider. Moreover, since it is an open empirical possibility that  some of our arithmetical or logical concepts are actually hardwired in this  way, we should be open to the possibility that concepts can be grounded not on  the basis of experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">I don't think, however, that this poses a problem for Jenkins' account of concept  grounding. Rather, I suspect that it is the empiricism that ought to be modified.  Jenkins claims that we have a strong pre-theoretic intuition that empiricism is  true. I don't share that intuition. Empiricism seems to me to be a theoretical commitment that is primarily motivated by a commitment to naturalism.  Since the existence of evolved hardwired concepts is compatible with a general naturalistic worldview, there seems little cost in rejecting a strictly empiricist view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Jenkins' account of concept grounding thus seems better suited to playing a role in the  defense of a realist, <i style=\"\">a priori</i>, and naturalist theory of arithmetical knowledge. Insofar as these three theses are independently plausible, this is a valuable contribution to make.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">The Epistemology of  Arithmetic</span></i><span style=\"\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">We're now in a position to examine Jenkins' account of our knowledge of arithmetic. On  her view, our knowledge of simple arithmetical truths, such as our knowledge  of the fact that 7+5=12, is explained as follows: The external world has  arithmetical structure. Our sense experience -- what Jenkins calls \"<span class=\"SpellE\">unconceptualized</span> sensory input\" -- is generated by our interaction with the world. This sensory input also has arithmetical structure that corresponds to the arithmetical structure of the world. The arithmetical structure of our experience is what grounds our arithmetical concepts. There are at least  two possible ways in which our arithmetical concepts may be grounded. We may  have acquired these concepts on the basis of our sensory input -- \"the camera-brain hypothesis\". Alternatively, these concepts may have been innately acquired but retained due to their usefulness when applied to  sensory input -- the \"filter-brain hypothesis\". We form simple arithmetical beliefs, such as the belief that 7+5=12, on the basis of conducting  competent investigations of our arithmetical concepts. Since our arithmetical  concepts are grounded, these simple arithmetical beliefs count as knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">This strikes me as a promising strategy for explaining our knowledge of arithmetic (and  perhaps other <i style=\"\">a priori </i>domains). But it is difficult to evaluate whether it ultimately can be made to work. One  issue concerns the parts of arithmetic that go beyond simple equations. We  don't only want to explain how we know that 7+5=12. We also want to explain our  knowledge of various generalizations -- for instance, that every number has a  successor, that addition is commutative, and that the principle of mathematical  induction is true. For the proposed strategy to explain this general knowledge,  our sensory input must have a rich arithmetical structure. (Or,  alternatively, sensory input with a meager arithmetical structure must be able to  ground sophisticated arithmetical concepts.) It would be helpful to have some indication of how this story might go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Even for the case of 7+5=12, it would be useful to have a better sense of the details of  the account. For instance, I'm not entirely sure what it is for the world to  have arithmetical structure. Does it suffice that the <span class=\"GramE\">world contain</span> objects? I'm not sure what it is for our sensory input to  have arithmetical structure. Presumably, the arithmetical structure of our  sensory input is whatever it is that explains why arithmetical concepts are  useful in organizing our experience. But it is not clear to me just what that  comes to. I'm also not sure how the structure of our sensory input is supposed to  ground even simple arithmetical concepts. In order to have a better sense of  whether Jenkins' account can explain our arithmetical knowledge, it would be  helpful to have a toy model that shows how the details might be filled in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">A different issue with Jenkins' account concerns whether it can really explain the <i style=\"\">a priori</i> status of our arithmetical knowledge. Suppose (for simplicity) that the world had turned out to be Newtonian. Suppose that we possessed the Newtonian concepts of <i style=\"\">force</i>, <i style=\"\">mass</i>, and <i style=\"\">acceleration</i>, and that these concepts were grounded by our sense experience. It is  plausible that the competent examination of the Newtonian concepts will yield the  belief that F=MA. On Jenkins' view, then, this belief would count as <i style=\"\">a priori</i> knowledge. Indeed, this scenario exactly parallels Jenkins' account of our actual knowledge that 7+5=12. But this is intuitively wrong. Even in the described scenario,  the belief that F=MA should count as <i style=\"\">a posteriori</i>. At the very least, there is a significant intuitive  difference between that piece of knowledge and our knowledge that 7+5=12. It is not  clear whether the account has the resources to explain this difference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Higher-Order  Knowledge<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Let me now turn to one last interesting issue that is discussed by Jenkins. This is the  status of higher-order knowledge -- for instance, the knowledge that certain  beliefs count as justified or knowledge, and the knowledge that certain concepts  count as justified or grounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">How do we know that our arithmetical concepts are justified? In answering this question,  Jenkins appeals to the indispensability of these concepts. Our arithmetical  concepts are useful in categorizing, predicting, and explaining our experience.  Indeed, our arithmetical concepts are indispensable to our best scientific  theories of the world. This provides us with <i style=\"\">a posteriori </i>evidence that our arithmetical concepts are justified. On  the basis of this evidence, we can come to know that our arithmetical  concepts are justified and (derivatively) that our simple arithmetical beliefs are justified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">While I see the intuitive pull of this view, it strikes me as a somewhat uncomfortable  position to adopt. On Jenkins' view, we are justified in believing simple  arithmetical truths on the basis of examining our concepts, but we are justified in believing that we are so justified on the basis of investigating what is indispensable to our scientific theories of the world. This is an  awkward juxtaposition of views.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">That is Jenkins' view on our knowledge of justification. What about our knowledge of  knowledge? Jenkins suggests that we cannot have any such knowledge. We cannot know  that we know arithmetical truths or that our arithmetical concepts are grounded.  She writes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\">All  we can do in the case of belief is to say which of our beliefs we think are justified, and assume that most or all of these are knowledge.  By the same token, all we can do in the case of concepts is say which of our  concepts<i style=\"\"> </i>we think are justified, and assume that most or all of these are grounded. (p. 144)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Thus, Jenkins seems to endorse a skeptical view about knowledge of knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Presumably, the background thought here concerns truth and accuracy: We cannot \"tell  from the inside\" that our arithmetical beliefs are true or that our arithmetical concepts accurately represent genuine features of reality.  So we cannot know that our arithmetical beliefs count as knowledge or that our arithmetical concepts count as grounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">This also strikes me as an uncomfortable position to adopt. Skepticism about higher-order knowledge is intuitively implausible; it seems intuitive that we know  that we know that 7+5=12. Moreover, it is difficult to see how this position  fits with the rest of Jenkins' views. On Jenkins' account, we can know that 7+5=12  on the basis of examining our arithmetical concepts. Presumably, we can know  that we believe that 7+5=12 on the basis of introspection. So why can't we put  this knowledge together and come to know that our arithmetical belief is  true? And if we can do that, and we can also come to know that our belief is  justified, why can't we know that we know that 7+5=12? It is difficult to see what additional bar there could be to our knowledge of our knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Conclusion<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">These critical remarks notwithstanding, <i style=\"\">Grounding Concepts</i> is an excellent book. It provides a sophisticated and clear discussion  of a difficult nest of issues in the philosophy of mathematics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics.
