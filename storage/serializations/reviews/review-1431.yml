content: "<p><i>Interpreting Kant\xE2\x80\x99s Critiques</i> is a collection of Karl Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 previously published papers on the three <i>Critiques</i>, written over almost 30 years of study of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy. In the extensive Introduction written for this volume, Ameriks identifies two central themes in these papers: 1. his articulation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s transcendental deduction arguments as \xE2\x80\x9Cregressive\xE2\x80\x9D arguments designed to vindicate a priori principles (whether cognitive, moral, or aesthetic), on the basis of a presumption that our ordinary objective judgments (or experience \xE2\x80\x9Cthickly\xE2\x80\x9D construed) are valid; and, 2. his interpretation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s transcendental idealism as a modest, but nonetheless metaphysical, doctrine (i.e., a view that there are things in themselves not identical to phenomena \xE2\x80\x9Cfrom another point of view\xE2\x80\x9D). Ameriks also devotes considerable attention to recent trends in Kant interpretation, and proposes controversial readings of a number of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s substantive claims, as, e.g., his readings of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s epistemology as largely unconcerned with Cartesian skepticism, of Kant\xE2\x80\x99 s moral philosophy as an \xE2\x80\x9Cexternalist\xE2\x80\x9D rationalism (as concerning, that is, not individual autonomy, but the autonomy of reason), and of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics as an objectivist account of aesthetic judgment.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 interpretive approach and claims might be termed a controversial traditionalism. His approach to Kant \xE2\x80\x93 both as a metaphysician and as presenting \xE2\x80\x9Cregressive\xE2\x80\x9D arguments -- is traditionalist, first, in adhering to a long-standing interpretive tradition stretching back, indeed, to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s earliest reception (see, e.g., pp. 7-12). Correspondingly, Ameriks argues forcefully against later, and currently popular, interpretive approaches, whether the purely epistemological readings of transcendental idealism (as concerning two \xE2\x80\x9Cpoints of view\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Caspects\xE2\x80\x9D of objects) as proposed by Allison and Prauss (Chapters 2, 3, 5, and 8), readings of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics as promising an \xE2\x80\x9Cexciting\xE2\x80\x9D new conception of intersubjectivity without objectivity, (p. 325) or those of neo-Kantian ethicists, according to whom, Ameriks writes, \xE2\x80\x9Cautonomy is understood\xE2\x80\xA6as a matter of individual self-imposition (as if to be a Kantian is to make up norms for oneself like a teenager budgeting one\xE2\x80\x99s own life for the first time)\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 278). Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 interpretation is traditionalist, too, in connecting Kant\xE2\x80\x99s critical views more closely to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s own tradition, i.e., German (Leibnizean) rationalism. Kant is not to be understood as a traditional, dogmatic rationalist (except, Ameriks suggests, in his moral philosophy) for Kant holds, on Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 view, that we cannot know anything \xE2\x80\x9Cdeterminate\xE2\x80\x9D about noumena. Nonetheless, on Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 reading, Kant shares with the Leibnizean rationalists their strong valuation of a priori, and (specifically) metaphysical knowledge \xE2\x80\x93 whether of universal lawfulness, or of those entities or aspects of ourselves that transcend common experience \xE2\x80\x93 in his epistemology, moral philosophy, and even aesthetics.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ameriks defends his controversial views very ably indeed. He provides considerable historical and textual support \xE2\x80\x93 from the critical and pre-critical works, as well as unpublished Reflectionen and lectures (especially the Lectures on Metaphysics) -- for his two, central interpretive claims. Thus, for example, Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 claim that Kant does not mean to refute all skepticism, but rather begins with rather robust premises (valid, objective judgments) and argues to conclusions concerning a priori principles alone (thus addressing skeptics \xE2\x80\x9Cof reason\xE2\x80\x9D) is, as he argues, based squarely on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s own descriptions of his critical project, paradigmatically in the Introductions to the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. And it is reflected, too, in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s beginning with the \xE2\x80\x9Cfact of reason\xE2\x80\x9D in the second critique, and Kant\xE2\x80\x99s definitional characterization of judgments of taste as having universal validity. Likewise, Ameriks makes a very persuasive case, including enlightening readings of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s puzzling claims concerning the \xE2\x80\x9Ccircle\xE2\x80\x9D in Groundwork III (in chapters 6 and 9), that Kant considered transcendental idealism a metaphysical doctrine crucial for his moral philosophy, in order to assert a substantive, metaphysical claim that we are free, not mere \xE2\x80\x9Cturnspits.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \n\
  <p>Ameriks also provides an \xE2\x80\x9Cerror theory\xE2\x80\x9D to explain the interpretive trends to which he objects. Ameriks suggests that such interpreters are driven by contemporary \xE2\x80\x9CWittgensteinian\xE2\x80\x9D philosophical views: e.g., that epistemology must address skepticism or else it is philosophically worthless; that any or all metaphysics is suspect; that transcendental, metaphysical freedom in particular is absurd (e.g., p. 98, chapter 8). Against these views, Ameriks argues, quite rightly, that there may well be philosophical arguments of real importance that do not address full-fledged skepticism, that Kant himself appears to believe that it is rather difficult to establish that metaphysical arguments or positions are unjustified, and that it is unclear, without argument, why Kant is wrong. Ameriks adduces an extremely helpful, well-known distinction in support of this last point, that between \xE2\x80\x9Cshort\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Clong\xE2\x80\x9D arguments to idealism (chapter 5). Many attribute to Kant some sort of \xE2\x80\x9Cshort\xE2\x80\x9D argument to (epistemic) idealism \xE2\x80\x93 from the fact, for example, that all representations or experiences are experiences <i>of ours</i>.  By contrast, Kant himself, Ameriks argues, engages in a \xE2\x80\x9Clong\xE2\x80\x9D argument to idealism in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, i.e., provides extensive arguments concerning which particular representations must be understood as derived from our own cognitive capabilities (and how they can be so understood), and arguments that, therefore, such representations (or the objects or experience governed by them) must be understood as transcendentally ideal. As a result, Ameriks argues, Kantian restrictions upon what we may claim concerning things not governed by these specific, transcendentally ideal conditions may be less globally, or easily, established.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ameriks takes, then, an unusual position in contemporary Kant scholarship: he attributes many of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s (apparently) most unfashionable views to Kant, and takes a sympathetic stance towards them. Ameriks by no means endorses all of these views: he suggests that he himself would endorse compatibilism, and argues that Kant fails to establish transcendental freedom (in part for reasons Kant himself adumbrates \xE2\x80\x93 but fails to apply concerning freedom \xE2\x80\x93in the Paralogisms). But he argues that Kant is quite right to worry about the metaphysics of freedom, and that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysical positions concerning transcendental freedom and responsibility as attributes of the noumenal, atemporal self are coherent, if not very palatable, doctrines. Thus Ameriks practices what he preaches, eschewing \xE2\x80\x9Cshort arguments\xE2\x80\x9D to dismiss or read away those of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s doctrines with which he disagrees, but, rather, engages in carefully reasoned investigation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s arguments.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ameriks contends that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s doctrine of \xE2\x80\x9Ctranscendental affection\xE2\x80\x9D (that our representations arise in part because we are \xE2\x80\x9Caffected\xE2\x80\x9D by things in themselves) is the \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99acid test\xE2\x80\x99 of Kantian hermeneutics,\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 157) and it does, indeed, figure centrally in Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 metaphysical reading. Ameriks presents a strong case for reading this doctrine as a metaphysical doctrine (as it appears to be) and one that Kant can consistently assert (as it appears not to be) \xE2\x80\x93 no easy task, and one that I am not sure is fully accomplished here. Ameriks argues that this doctrine reflects a \xE2\x80\x9Cbasic belief,\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cimmediate\xE2\x80\x9D commonsensical, realist \xE2\x80\x9Cthought\xE2\x80\x9D that Kant does not, indeed, prove to be true, but \xE2\x80\x93 as part of his \xE2\x80\x9Cstarting point in common experience\xE2\x80\x9D -- also never calls into question. And Ameriks argues that because this doctrine is a very \xE2\x80\x9Cindeterminate\xE2\x80\x9D claim, it is consistent with Kant\xE2\x80\x99s critical limitations on our justified cognitive claims to \xE2\x80\x9Cdeterminate\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge (pp.25-31).</p>  \n\
  <p>But the long-standing objections concerning the consistency of this doctrine \xE2\x80\x93 and the corresponding temptation to an epistemic, rather than metaphysical, interpretation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s idealism \xE2\x80\x93do not arise (only) from a prejudice against metaphysics (or, in Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 words, a \xE2\x80\x9Cdistaste for the noumenal\xE2\x80\x9D) or \xE2\x80\x9Cshort\xE2\x80\x9D arguments to idealism. These worries have strong textual support in passages like the following: \xE2\x80\x9CIf, by merely intelligible objects we understand those things that are thought through pure categories, without any schema of sensibility, then things of this sort are impossible. For the condition of the objective use of all our concepts of understanding is merely the manner of our sensible intuition, through which objects are given to us, and, if we abstract from the latter, then the former have no relation at all to any sort of object\xE2\x80\x9D (A286/B342; my emphasis). Kant concludes that the concept of the noumenon is a \xE2\x80\x9Cproblematic\xE2\x80\x9D concept, standing for the possibility that there might be objects intuited by other forms of intellect not our own (i.e., one might say, representing another \xE2\x80\x9Cpoint of view\xE2\x80\x9D). Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 account would be bolstered by some attention to \xE2\x80\x93 and explanation of how, on his view, one ought to read this sort of passage. Moreover, one might be tempted, philosophically, to think that Kant here identifies the only consistent position he may take and the reasons why he himself cannot, consistently, make even indeterminate causal and existential claims concerning noumena (as \xE2\x80\x9Caffecting\xE2\x80\x9D us). On a Kantian view, we may well, as Ameriks argues, be able to \xE2\x80\x9Cthink\xE2\x80\x9D (problematically, but still meaningfully) about noumena and do so, importantly, in practical contexts (e.g., concerning God) (p. 23). And we certainly cannot have \xE2\x80\x9Cdeterminate\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge of noumena. But, if claims concerning noumena have \xE2\x80\x9Cno relation to an object,\xE2\x80\x9D how can they \xE2\x80\x93 no matter how thinkable and indeterminate they are \xE2\x80\x93 count as justifiable, metaphysical doctrine (i.e., knowledge)? Kant of all philosophers, it would seem, should not allow that we may endorse our \xE2\x80\x9Cimmediate,\xE2\x80\x9D a priori, metaphysical thoughts as true, without any license to claim that they are in \xE2\x80\x9Crelation to an object.\xE2\x80\x9D Why, in other words, should this belief get an exemption from Kant\xE2\x80\x99s strictures concerning the requisite justification for synthetic a priori claims?</p>  \n\
  <p>Likewise, though I am sympathetic to Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 interpretation of Kant as engaged in \xE2\x80\x9Cregressive\xE2\x80\x9D arguments (not intended to refute all skepticism), Kant\xE2\x80\x99s texts are not unambiguous here. As Ameriks argues, Kant identifies the a priori as his primary concern in the critiques, and seems in general remarkably unconcerned by skepticism about empirical knowledge. And Ameriks also, rightly, emphasizes the problems that arise if one reads Kant as responding to skepticism by arguing that categorial synthesis is necessary for, and present in, <i>any</i> representation to which we can conjoin the \xE2\x80\x9CI think\xE2\x80\x9D (rather than solely in objective claims, as on his view). Kant famously argues in the A edition, however, that without categorial synthesis, our experience would be \xE2\x80\x9Cless than a dream\xE2\x80\x9D (A112). Perhaps Kant abandoned this view concerning the conclusions of his arguments in the B edition, though one would have thought he would signal such a dramatic change in his new Preface. Moreover, as Ameriks notes, by the end of the Analytic Kant purports to have shown that <i>any</i> coherent (viz., temporally ordered) self-conscious experience of one\xE2\x80\x99s own states already entails (for it presupposes) that one makes justifiable, objective judgments concerning external objects (pp. 18-19). Thus even if (as Ameriks suggests) the deduction argument itself should not be read as a refutation of skepticism, could not Kant\xE2\x80\x99s entire argument in the Analytic be characterized (as, e.g., Guyer does and Ameriks suggests briefly that one actually could [p. 19n]) as an argument against at least the great majority of skeptical views?</p>  \n\
  <p>As is perhaps clear from these remarks, even though the essays are, in principle, evenly divided among the critiques (5 each to the first two critiques, 3 to the third critique), the collection is weighted in favor of the first critique, both substantively and evaluatively. The three essays on the third critique are devoted, primarily, to the reconstruction of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s deduction of taste as related to the \xE2\x80\x9Cconditions\xE2\x80\x9D for cognition, and the essays on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral philosophy not only concentrate on the intersection of the moral philosophy with the theoretical philosophy \xE2\x80\x93 i.e., freedom \xE2\x80\x93 but also are largely negative, comprising arguments that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s attempts at a deduction of the moral law or to prove freedom or both fail. Thus, Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 approach might seem \xE2\x80\x93 especially to those primarily interested in the other two critiques \xE2\x80\x93 less sympathetic than one might desire to the possibility that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s investigations of practical reason and judgment might provide fundamental insights of their own. Perhaps pure practical reason can, that is, provide an insight into our rational natures that supplements and transcends that which is provided by theoretical reason, and that does not need a theoretical warrant (except of its possibility, of course). In his final (review) essay on the practical philosophy, Ameriks suggests that, though Kant fails to prove that pure practical reason is \xE2\x80\x9Cexecutively\xE2\x80\x9D free, it may be a \xE2\x80\x9Cformal\xE2\x80\x9D free cause in its legislation of the moral law and thus may transcend theoretical reason. But the bulk of the treatment of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral philosophy here touches only glancingly on the moral law, and is quite critical.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 reading of the deduction of taste \xE2\x80\x93 as comprising an argument that such judgments are, in fact, objective, conceptual judgments, not \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectively universal\xE2\x80\x9D (despite Kant\xE2\x80\x99s obsessive repetition of this very claim) \xE2\x80\x93 is, likewise, a controversial and (unusually for Ameriks) a strikingly reconstructive reading of this text. Ameriks helpfully recounts Ginsborg\xE2\x80\x99s and Guyer\xE2\x80\x99s (well-taken, I believe) textual/interpretive criticisms of his view (pp.319-323, 338-343), so I will not rehearse them here. More broadly, however, though he aims to defend Kant\xE2\x80\x99s deduction of taste, Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 conceptualist, objectivist reconstruction is constrained \xE2\x80\x93 as he admits \xE2\x80\x93 by Kantian epistemology, by the view (in particular) that there can be no judgment, and certainly no universally valid judgment, that is not grounded on a(n objective) concept. Perhaps Kant\xE2\x80\x99s own stated view to the contrary concerning judgments of taste ought, ultimately, to be judged wrong or incoherent. But to endorse such constraints from the beginning means, in effect, to render aesthetic judgment as cognitive judgment, and thus to foreclose the possibility that, in investigating aesthetics, Kant came to a new conception of judgment, that aesthetics might contribute something unique to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s systematic philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>For any student of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s critical philosophy, this work merits serious, attentive reading. Ameriks provides here a perhaps unequaled orientation to the positions and approaches in contemporary Kant scholarship both Anglo-American and German (a daunting body of work and thus an impressive accomplishment itself). The collection attests to the value of Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 long devotion to Kantian philosophy and the interpretation thereof, to his analytical carefulness and sensitivity to historical context, both Kant\xE2\x80\x99s and our own; his accounts of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s deduction arguments are, one and all, meticulous. And, though some of these essays may be familiar to Kantian readers, reading them here, in (more or less) chronological order and together with those that are not easily available, allows one to follow Ameriks as he clarifies, broadens, and deepens his views in dialogue with others. The fruits of this long reflection are clear, too, in the Introduction and the final chapters of Part II and Part III, the most recently written portions of the book, in which Ameriks provides thoughtful, overarching accounts of the historical and continuing philosophical significance of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy, as a \xE2\x80\x9Cmodest\xE2\x80\x9D attempt to come to terms with the dramatic transformation of natural science in modernity, and to remain true to common experience as well as to the highest aspirations, metaphysical and moral, of human beings. And, though these interpretations will not persuade all Kantians, Ameriks provides an invaluable service to Kant scholarship, a deeply and notoriously partisan field, in warning against the dangers of reconstructive distortion, and to all readers of Kant in elaborating and powerfully defending his controversial-traditionalist interpretation. </p>"

Ameriks argues that this doctrine reflects a \xE2\x80\x9Cbasic belief,\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cimmediate\xE2\x80\x9D commonsensical, realist \xE2\x80\x9Cthought\xE2\x80\x9D that Kant does not, indeed, prove to be true, but \xE2\x80\x93 as part of his \xE2\x80\x9Cstarting point in common experience\xE2\x80\x9D -- also never calls into question. And Ameriks argues that because this doctrine is a very \xE2\x80\x9Cindeterminate\xE2\x80\x9D claim, it is consistent with Kant\xE2\x80\x99s critical limitations on our justified cognitive claims to \xE2\x80\x9Cdeterminate\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge (pp.25-31).</p>  \n\
  <p>But the long-standing objections concerning the consistency of this doctrine \xE2\x80\x93 and the corresponding temptation to an epistemic, rather than metaphysical, interpretation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s idealism \xE2\x80\x93do not arise (only) from a prejudice against metaphysics (or, in Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 words, a \xE2\x80\x9Cdistaste for the noumenal\xE2\x80\x9D) or \xE2\x80\x9Cshort\xE2\x80\x9D arguments to idealism. These worries have strong textual support in passages like the following: \xE2\x80\x9CIf, by merely intelligible objects we understand those things that are thought through pure categories, without any schema of sensibility, then things of this sort are impossible. For the condition of the objective use of all our concepts of understanding is merely the manner of our sensible intuition, through which objects are given to us, and, if we abstract from the latter, then the former have no relation at all to any sort of object\xE2\x80\x9D (A286/B342; my emphasis). Kant concludes that the concept of the noumenon is a \xE2\x80\x9Cproblematic\xE2\x80\x9D concept, standing for the possibility that there might be objects intuited by other forms of intellect not our own (i.e., one might say, representing another \xE2\x80\x9Cpoint of view\xE2\x80\x9D). Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 account would be bolstered by some attention to \xE2\x80\x93 and explanation of how, on his view, one ought to read this sort of passage. Moreover, one might be tempted, philosophically, to think that Kant here identifies the only consistent position he may take and the reasons why he himself cannot, consistently, make even indeterminate causal and existential claims concerning noumena (as \xE2\x80\x9Caffecting\xE2\x80\x9D us). On a Kantian view, we may well, as Ameriks argues, be able to \xE2\x80\x9Cthink\xE2\x80\x9D (problematically, but still meaningfully) about noumena and do so, importantly, in practical contexts (e.g., concerning God) (p. 23). And we certainly cannot have \xE2\x80\x9Cdeterminate\xE2\x80\x9D knowledge of noumena. But, if claims concerning noumena have \xE2\x80\x9Cno relation to an object,\xE2\x80\x9D how can they \xE2\x80\x93 no matter how thinkable and indeterminate they are \xE2\x80\x93 count as justifiable, metaphysical doctrine (i.e., knowledge)? Kant of all philosophers, it would seem, should not allow that we may endorse our \xE2\x80\x9Cimmediate,\xE2\x80\x9D a priori, metaphysical thoughts as true, without any license to claim that they are in \xE2\x80\x9Crelation to an object.\xE2\x80\x9D Why, in other words, should this belief get an exemption from Kant\xE2\x80\x99s strictures concerning the requisite justification for synthetic a priori claims?</p>  \n\
  <p>Likewise, though I am sympathetic to Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 interpretation of Kant as engaged in \xE2\x80\x9Cregressive\xE2\x80\x9D arguments (not intended to refute all skepticism), Kant\xE2\x80\x99s texts are not unambiguous here. As Ameriks argues, Kant identifies the a priori as his primary concern in the critiques, and seems in general remarkably unconcerned by skepticism about empirical knowledge. And Ameriks also, rightly, emphasizes the problems that arise if one reads Kant as responding to skepticism by arguing that categorial synthesis is necessary for, and present in, <i>any</i> representation to which we can conjoin the \xE2\x80\x9CI think\xE2\x80\x9D (rather than solely in objective claims, as on his view). Kant famously argues in the A edition, however, that without categorial synthesis, our experience would be \xE2\x80\x9Cless than a dream\xE2\x80\x9D (A112). Perhaps Kant abandoned this view concerning the conclusions of his arguments in the B edition, though one would have thought he would signal such a dramatic change in his new Preface. Moreover, as Ameriks notes, by the end of the Analytic Kant purports to have shown that <i>any</i> coherent (viz., temporally ordered) self-conscious experience of one\xE2\x80\x99s own states already entails (for it presupposes) that one makes justifiable, objective judgments concerning external objects (pp. 18-19). Thus even if (as Ameriks suggests) the deduction argument itself should not be read as a refutation of skepticism, could not Kant\xE2\x80\x99s entire argument in the Analytic be characterized (as, e.g., Guyer does and Ameriks suggests briefly that one actually could [p. 19n]) as an argument against at least the great majority of skeptical views?</p>  \n\
  <p>As is perhaps clear from these remarks, even though the essays are, in principle, evenly divided among the critiques (5 each to the first two critiques, 3 to the third critique), the collection is weighted in favor of the first critique, both substantively and evaluatively. The three essays on the third critique are devoted, primarily, to the reconstruction of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s deduction of taste as related to the \xE2\x80\x9Cconditions\xE2\x80\x9D for cognition, and the essays on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral philosophy not only concentrate on the intersection of the moral philosophy with the theoretical philosophy \xE2\x80\x93 i.e., freedom \xE2\x80\x93 but also are largely negative, comprising arguments that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s attempts at a deduction of the moral law or to prove freedom or both fail. Thus, Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 approach might seem \xE2\x80\x93 especially to those primarily interested in the other two critiques \xE2\x80\x93 less sympathetic than one might desire to the possibility that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s investigations of practical reason and judgment might provide fundamental insights of their own. Perhaps pure practical reason can, that is, provide an insight into our rational natures that supplements and transcends that which is provided by theoretical reason, and that does not need a theoretical warrant (except of its possibility, of course). In his final (review) essay on the practical philosophy, Ameriks suggests that, though Kant fails to prove that pure practical reason is \xE2\x80\x9Cexecutively\xE2\x80\x9D free, it may be a \xE2\x80\x9Cformal\xE2\x80\x9D free cause in its legislation of the moral law and thus may transcend theoretical reason. But the bulk of the treatment of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral philosophy here touches only glancingly on the moral law, and is quite critical.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 reading of the deduction of taste \xE2\x80\x93 as comprising an argument that such judgments are, in fact, objective, conceptual judgments, not \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectively universal\xE2\x80\x9D (despite Kant\xE2\x80\x99s obsessive repetition of this very claim) \xE2\x80\x93 is, likewise, a controversial and (unusually for Ameriks) a strikingly reconstructive reading of this text. Ameriks helpfully recounts Ginsborg\xE2\x80\x99s and Guyer\xE2\x80\x99s (well-taken, I believe) textual/interpretive criticisms of his view (pp.319-323, 338-343), so I will not rehearse them here. More broadly, however, though he aims to defend Kant\xE2\x80\x99s deduction of taste, Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 conceptualist, objectivist reconstruction is constrained \xE2\x80\x93 as he admits \xE2\x80\x93 by Kantian epistemology, by the view (in particular) that there can be no judgment, and certainly no universally valid judgment, that is not grounded on a(n objective) concept. Perhaps Kant\xE2\x80\x99s own stated view to the contrary concerning judgments of taste ought, ultimately, to be judged wrong or incoherent. But to endorse such constraints from the beginning means, in effect, to render aesthetic judgment as cognitive judgment, and thus to foreclose the possibility that, in investigating aesthetics, Kant came to a new conception of judgment, that aesthetics might contribute something unique to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s systematic philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>For any student of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s critical philosophy, this work merits serious, attentive reading. Ameriks provides here a perhaps unequaled orientation to the positions and approaches in contemporary Kant scholarship both Anglo-American and German (a daunting body of work and thus an impressive accomplishment itself). The collection attests to the value of Ameriks\xE2\x80\x99 long devotion to Kantian philosophy and the interpretation thereof, to his analytical carefulness and sensitivity to historical context, both Kant\xE2\x80\x99s and our own; his accounts of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s deduction arguments are, one and all, meticulous. And, though some of these essays may be familiar to Kantian readers, reading them here, in (more or less) chronological order and together with those that are not easily available, allows one to follow Ameriks as he clarifies, broadens, and deepens his views in dialogue with others. The fruits of this long reflection are clear, too, in the Introduction and the final chapters of Part II and Part III, the most recently written portions of the book, in which Ameriks provides thoughtful, overarching accounts of the historical and continuing philosophical significance of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy, as a \xE2\x80\x9Cmodest\xE2\x80\x9D attempt to come to terms with the dramatic transformation of natural science in modernity, and to remain true to common experience as well as to the highest aspirations, metaphysical and moral, of human beings. And, though these interpretations will not persuade all Kantians, Ameriks provides an invaluable service to Kant scholarship, a deeply and notoriously partisan field, in warning against the dangers of reconstructive distortion, and to all readers of Kant in elaborating and powerfully defending his controversial-traditionalist interpretation. </p>"
