content: "<p>This book is a collection of essays by outstanding authors who are, for the most part, already well-known contributors to the study of the background of 20th Century philosophy. The authors and their essays are, in order, Peter Simons, \xE2\x80\x9COpen and Closed Culture: A New Way to Divide Austrians\xE2\x80\x9D; Barry Smith, \xE2\x80\x9CAustria and the Rise of Scientific Philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D; Dagfinn F\xC3\xB8llesdal, \xE2\x80\x9CBolzanos bleibende Leistungen\xE2\x80\x9D; Christian Beyer, \xE2\x80\x9CBolzano and Husserl on Singular Existential Statements\xE2\x80\x9D; Edgar Morscher, \xE2\x80\x9CDie Geburt der Gegenstandstheorie aus einem Missverst\xC3\xA4ndinis?\xE2\x80\x9D; Arkadiusz Chrudzimski, \xE2\x80\x9CMeinong und Supervaluation\xE2\x80\x9D; Wilhelm Baumgartner, \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano und die \xC3\xB6sterreichische Philosophie\xE2\x80\x9D; Dieter M\xC3\xBCnch, \xE2\x80\x9CFranz Brentano und die katholische Aristoteles-Rezeption\xE2\x80\x9D; Wolfgang Huemer, \xE2\x80\x9CHusserl\xE2\x80\x99s Critique of Psychologism and his Relation to the Brentano School\xE2\x80\x9D; Gianfranco Soldati, \xE2\x80\x9CAbstraction and Abstract Concepts: On Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Philosophy of Arithmetic</i>;\xE2\x80\x9D Tommaso Piazza, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Quest for the Synthetic A Priori: Husserl and Schlick\xE2\x80\x99s Debate Revisited\xE2\x80\x9D; Robin Rollinger, \xE2\x80\x9CAustrian Theories of Judgment: Bolzano, Brentano, Meinong, and Husserl\xE2\x80\x9D; Roberto Poli, \xE2\x80\x9CApproaching Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s Theory of Categories\xE2\x80\x9D; Dale Jacquette, \xE2\x80\x9CAssumption and Mechanical Simulation of Hypothetical Reasoning\xE2\x80\x9D; and Jan Woleski, \xE2\x80\x9CMalum, Transcendentalia and Logic.\xE2\x80\x9D The articles by Smith, F\xC3\xB8llesdal and M\xC3\xBCnch have been published elsewhere, but the other articles were written for this volume.</p>  \n\
  <p>Now it should go without saying that each of these essays, by such authors, contributes significantly to our understanding of \xE2\x80\x9CCentral European\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy. Beyond that, it is difficult to discern any significant interplay between the essays, leading to a more penetrating grasp of the larger picture that the volume seems intended to sketch. Perhaps there is such, and I just missed it. In any case, I will first comment on two of the essays that I personally found very illuminating, and then turn to some questions about the volume as a whole and the project it seems to represent. That I select the particular essays that I do for comment should not be taken to indicate a judgment of their relative importance.</p>  \n\
  <p>Edgar Morscher\xE2\x80\x99s paper on the origination of Meinong\xE2\x80\x99s Gegenstandstheorie casts light on a worry that occurs to one who comes to Meinong from Russell\xE2\x80\x99s theory of \xE2\x80\x9Cdenoting\xE2\x80\x9D phrases or terms. In particular, one is apt to read Meinong, in the spirit of earlier Analytic philosophers, as if he were tripped up by a mistake of logical grammar. He mistook the structure of certain sentences, thinking they contained names which, in fact, were descriptions. And straightway he inferred, the story might go, that there must <i>be</i> or in some sense exist objects which the supposed names supposedly denoted. Since only a \xE2\x80\x99funny\xE2\x80\x99 kind of being would meet the need, such a conclusion was unacceptable to right thinking philosophers, and a rewriting of the kinds of sentences in question would undercut the inference and unburden us of unwanted ontological complications. So that story goes.</p>  \n\
  <p>It is somehow encouraging to see another possibility for Meinong. Morscher explains how Robert Zimmermann\xE2\x80\x99s textbook presentation of Bolzano\xE2\x80\x99s theory of \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectless representations\xE2\x80\x9D might have led Meinong to hold his views on representations without (actual) objects. On Bolzano\xE2\x80\x99s theory a representation can be of actual things, it can be of non-actual things, such as <i>number</i>, <i>triangle</i>, <i>Satz an sich</i>, or it can be of something that does not exist in any sense. These latter he calls \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectless\xE2\x80\x9D (\xE2\x80\x9C<i>gegenstandlos</i>\xE2\x80\x9D) representations. The mark of actual being is causal efficacy. Actuality is a wholly \xE2\x80\x9Cnormal\xE2\x80\x9D property. Unfortunately, Bolzano also uses \xE2\x80\x9Cexistence\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing\xE2\x80\x9D synonymously with \xE2\x80\x9Cactuality,\xE2\x80\x9D and accordingly says of non-actual objects that they do not exist, but that there merely <i>are</i>.)</p>  \n\
  <p>Robert Zimmermann, involved in the mid-19th Century educational reform movement in Austria, produced a required text, <i>Philosophische Propaedeutic f\xC3\xBCr Obergymnasien</i>, divided into two parts, one on Empirical Psychology and the other on Formal Logic. In the latter, he incorporated long sections of Bolzano\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Wissenschaftslehre</i>, and many passages almost word for word. Bolzano always encouraged his students and friends to use his ideas freely and without acknowledgement. Zimmermann took over Bolzano\xE2\x80\x99s theory of objectual (\xE2\x80\x9Cgegenst\xC3\xA4ndlich\xE2\x80\x9D) and objectless representations <i>an sich</i>, without mentioning Bolzano. And he did so in such a way that the objectless representation of merely possible or of impossible objects (golden mountains, round squares, etc.) not only is <i>of</i> or <i>about</i> some one thing as opposed to another; but, also, that what it is of or about in some sense <i>is</i>. All of this was contrary to Bolzano\xE2\x80\x99s clear statements and intent. Zimmermann\xE2\x80\x99s modification of Bolzano\xE2\x80\x99s theory of objectless representations in themselves, whether intentional or not, \xE2\x80\x9Cleads immediately to Meinong\xE2\x80\x99s theory of objects, which guarantees an object for every representation\xE2\x80\x94even if it may be a merely possible or even an impossible one.\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 100)</p>  \n\
  <p>Morscher continues to develop the possible connections between Meinong\xE2\x80\x99s theory and Zimmermann\xE2\x80\x99s presentation of Bolzano\xE2\x80\x99s views, by commenting on further ways Zimmermann manages to overwrite his clear distinction between representation and object. He does not claim to have shown that the source of Meinong\xE2\x80\x99s theory lies in Zimmermann/Bolzano, or to have proof that Meinong was influenced by these passages in Zimmermann\xE2\x80\x99s textbook or even knew of them. But he hopes to have incited further investigation in this direction. And that will also be welcome to those of use who find the \xE2\x80\x9Clogical grammar\xE2\x80\x9D source of Meinong\xE2\x80\x99s theory unappealing.</p>  \n\
  <p>Dieter M\xC3\xBCnch contributes an illuminating discussion of how the study of Aristotle interacted with a major effort to reform and re-establish a specifically <i>Catholic</i> philosophy that would also be\xE2\x80\x94unlike German Idealism\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9Dscientific.\xE2\x80\x9D His paper overflows with fascinating details of the social dynamics, and especially of the ecclesiastical and theological issues and tensions, that were at play in the effort, in Catholic Germany and in Austria, to bring about a \xE2\x80\x9Ccomplete restoration of \xE2\x80\x99Christian\xE2\x80\x99 principles in society, in the life of the individual and in the family.\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 171) Much of M\xC3\xBCch\xE2\x80\x99s article is devoted to the contents of two journals, <i>Civilt\xC3\xA0 cattolica</i>, founded in 1849, and <i>Der Katholik,</i> New Series, beginning in 1858.</p>  \n\
  <p>The major underlying issue for this effort was whether or not Catholic life and thought could become a living force in the contemporary world\xE2\x80\x94especially, could it be \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94<i>within</i> the confines of Catholic dogma. This was thought to be possible by rejecting accommodations to Modern Thought, on the one hand, and appropriating and adapting the Aristotelian-Catholic system already largely completed by Thomas Aquinas, on the other. (p. 176) The \xE2\x80\x9Credemption of the ancient, god-seeking philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D was to be done \xE2\x80\x9Cby means of the substantive truth that came forward in Christ.\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 175)</p>  \n\
  <p>Brentano was, of course, a major player in this effort, under the influence of his beloved professor, Franz Jakob Clemens, and of other now less well-know teachers. Certainly Brentano was to come into conflict with the Catholic church. That is fairly well known. Far less known is the depth of his involvement with and commitment to the program of the intellectual restoration of Catholic teachings, and how that led to his work on Aristotle, from his doctoral dissertation onward, and to his role in the \xE2\x80\x9Creception\xE2\x80\x9D of Aristotle among Catholic and non-Catholic thinkers of his day. M\xC3\xBCnch provides information on these matters which I suspect can be found in few if any other places. He goes in some detail into Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s disagreement with Trendelenburg over the deduction of Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x99categories\xE2\x80\x99 (insisting upon the primacy of ontological over Greek linguistic considerations in this matter, pp. 186f), and he provides a thorough discussion of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s dispute with Zeller (pp. 188ff) over the \xE2\x80\x9Cactive\xE2\x80\x9D intellect in Aristotle and its possible immortality (which of course Brentano favored). Both of these encounters yield philosophically rich discussions that remain strongly relevant to contemporary work just because they concern such fundamental issues. But Brentano \xE2\x80\x9Cfound interesting in Aristotle precisely those themes that are relevant for the construction of a Catholic science.\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 193) Nevertheless, as his later life clearly demonstrated, he did not keep his thought in subjection to the Church or to Thomas Aquinas. This is seen most clearly in the re-direction of his thought under the influence of August Comte, and in his rejection of the old view of the <i>soul</i> as the subject of psychology and his turn to psychical <i>phenomena</i> instead. This had to go hand-in-hand with a rejection of the most fundamental distinctions of Aristotelian ontology and their replacement with a theory of wholes and parts, giving a new but still profound significance to Aristotle for Brentano and his school. In spite of his break with the Church over various matters, such as the infallibility of the Pope, he continued to the end to pursue the goal of a \xE2\x80\x9CCatholic science.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \n\
  <p>I think the primary contribution of this volume lies in its illumination of the history of the thought and culture in which the work of Brentano and his students was submerged, and apart from which it has little philosophical life. Indeed, philosophical thought in the 19th century, of which Brentano and Central European Philosophy is but one chapter, is still eclipsed by the idea that \xE2\x80\x9Csomething happened\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94possibly a \xE2\x80\x9CRevolution in Philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94that makes it philosophically pointless or unrewarding. There is still widespread the suggestion that what happened was \xE2\x80\x9CAnalytic Philosophy,\xE2\x80\x9D and that the way to show anything in the 19th Century to be worthwhile philosophically is to show it to be, <i>really</i>, \xE2\x80\x9CAnalytic.\xE2\x80\x9D For a few decades those involved in \xE2\x80\x9Canalysis\xE2\x80\x9D agreed upon what was being analyzed, and Analytic Philosophy could be identified as a kind of thinking that <i>analyzes that.</i> Those days are now long past, and whatever contrast there is between Analytic Philosopher and its \xE2\x80\x99other\xE2\x80\x99 seems to be a certain difference of style. As Barry Smith puts it, with reference to the early Husserl, Bolzano, Brentano and Mach, they \xE2\x80\x9Cemploy a sober, scientific style, and shun pretensions.\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 46) I agree that there is a difference of degree here, but would not want to have to show that all those who self-identify as Analytic philosophers manage the high standard that Barry Smith suggests. And I am afraid that the term \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D (\xE2\x80\x9Cwissenschaftlich\xE2\x80\x9D), which many Central European Philosophers still love to use today to characterize what they do, does not have the type of precise meaning that Analytic Philosophy supposedly prefers. It may even be a little pretentious. Or it may just mean <i>good</i> philosophy. (On the problem of making \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D intelligible, as applied to a philosophy, while avoiding \xE2\x80\x9Cscientism,\xE2\x80\x9D I have written further in my paper, \xE2\x80\x9CWho Needs Brentano\xE2\x80\x9D (in <i>The Brentano Puzzle</i>, ed. Roberto Poli, Aldershot:Ashgate, 1998, 15-43); and on the current, precarious position of \xE2\x80\x9CAnalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy, see Aaron Preston, \xE2\x80\x9CProlegomena to any Future History of Analytic Philosophy,\xE2\x80\x9D <i>Metaphilosophy</i> , 2004, pp. 445-465.)</p>  \n\
  <p>In any case, these are essays well worth reading, and not just for historical understanding, but for illumination of logical issues as well. If, as I suspect, the project of \xE2\x80\x9Cbuilding an interesting bridge between phenomenology and analytic philosophy and, thus, creating a new foundation that allows for an original perspective on central problems of philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (as the publishers blurb says), remains a bit beyond our grasp, we still learn a great deal that we are not apt to learn elsewhere. And that may be better than that bridge.</p>"

As Barry Smith puts it, with reference to the early Husserl, Bolzano, Brentano and Mach, they \xE2\x80\x9Cemploy a sober, scientific style, and shun pretensions.\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 46) I agree that there is a difference of degree here, but would not want to have to show that all those who self-identify as Analytic philosophers manage the high standard that Barry Smith suggests. And I am afraid that the term \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D (\xE2\x80\x9Cwissenschaftlich\xE2\x80\x9D), which many Central European Philosophers still love to use today to characterize what they do, does not have the type of precise meaning that Analytic Philosophy supposedly prefers. It may even be a little pretentious. Or it may just mean <i>good</i> philosophy. (On the problem of making \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D intelligible, as applied to a philosophy, while avoiding \xE2\x80\x9Cscientism,\xE2\x80\x9D I have written further in my paper, \xE2\x80\x9CWho Needs Brentano\xE2\x80\x9D (in <i>The Brentano Puzzle</i>, ed. Roberto Poli, Aldershot:Ashgate, 1998, 15-43); and on the current, precarious position of \xE2\x80\x9CAnalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy, see Aaron Preston, \xE2\x80\x9CProlegomena to any Future History of Analytic Philosophy,\xE2\x80\x9D <i>Metaphilosophy</i> , 2004, pp. 445-465.)</p>  \n\
  <p>In any case, these are essays well worth reading, and not just for historical understanding, but for illumination of logical issues as well. If, as I suspect, the project of \xE2\x80\x9Cbuilding an interesting bridge between phenomenology and analytic philosophy and, thus, creating a new foundation that allows for an original perspective on central problems of philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (as the publishers blurb says), remains a bit beyond our grasp, we still learn a great deal that we are not apt to learn elsewhere. And that may be better than that bridge.</p>"
