Denis Arnold and the contributors to this volume are  surely among the best in the field, and picking up the book, I was sure that my  effort in reviewing would be well rewarded. I was not disappointed. Arnold has  managed to create a reunion of the first two fields of practical (applied, professional) ethics, biomedical ethics and business ethics, with all  the drama of the dilemmas, and with no pretense at solutions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">In the introduction (unsigned; presumably by Arnold) the problem underlying its investigation is set out very clearly: the  recent move of the professions of health care from a service orientation to  market orientation. The price of health care has risen dramatically, consuming <span class=\"GramE\">ever larger</span> portions of the GDP, especially in the  United States. Is this right? Is this just? These questions cannot be addressed without calling on the disciplines of bioethics and business ethics to  work together, and as Arnold points out, they are seldom in conversation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">But scholars of both disciplines were apparently  given the common task<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span class=\"GramE\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">to</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> evaluate the practices of profit-seeking healthcare organizations, and business-friendly public policies regarding health care, and to offer  normative guidance regarding the ethical delivery of healthcare products and  services by profit-seeking organizations operating in a global marketplace. (p. 1)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Full stop. From the point of view of traditional bioethics, we have already trespassed over several lines. What's this  \"profit-seeking healthcare organization\" we're supposed to take seriously? Is it  anything like our local profit-seeking evangelical church whose pastor just went  off for several years in jail? If health care seeks profit, it will surely find  it -- there's nothing we want so much as freedom from pain and a long active life, and  to the extent that we have money, we'll pay the earth to get them. People  without money will not be able to get them, of course, but then they can't get expensive sports cars, either, and we don't mourn over that. Is health  care radically different from sports cars, or even music lessons? <span class=\"GramE\">If not, whence the controversy?</span> And if it is different, then maybe  pursuit of profit is totally alien to the profession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Where is the baseline, the position from which we  move when we try to bring the practice of medicine up to date? Edmund  Pellegrino has always maintained that the heart of medicine is the physician-patient encounter, where the physician, drawing upon his scientific knowledge  and experience with healing, helps the patient to make decisions that will  aid his return to health. The physician's entire attention is focused on the  patient's welfare. Alternative agendas -- money, political advantage, whatever --  are strictly ruled out of the decision making process, regarded as alien  intrusions -- viruses -- infecting the practice of medicine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Those of us with a history in the field find  ourselves faced with a new vocabulary. \"Healthcare\" is a new word. We've been talking about the ethics of medicine for centuries, and since  Hippocrates we have known that medicine could be practiced for disproportionate  material rewards. In Sinclair Lewis' <i style=\"\">Main Street, </i>the tale of a physician's wife in a small Midwestern town early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, disapproving mention is made of one of the town physicians, who  makes a few too many visits to the sick he attends, to gather a few more fees.  The actual status of the physician of beloved memory, the general  practitioner in small town America of the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century,  closely parallels the status of the college professor in that time, a life of  genteel poverty. Why? They probably knew how to make their profession more  profitable, but, unlike the \"Park Avenue doctor,\" who specialized, in the words of the immortal Tom Lehrer, in \"diseases of the rich,\" they elected not to. Most physicians in independent practice now make the same  choice. When they choose otherwise, we have the case of McAllen, Texas, charging  Medicare much more than comparable areas for procedures that do not apparently improve  the health of the patients. But what is \"healthcare,\" in relation to medicine? Can \"healthcare\" be practiced for profit?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">The challenge that Arnold presented to his writers, then, was controversial at its heart. To give the book a fair review, I  will have to set aside for the moment the argument -- with which I have a  certain amount of sympathy -- of those who feel that fundamental corruption is  shown in the asking of his question. Arnold is on the crest of the wave of the  future, and he has done a very good job of assembling its controversies and  dilemmas. I'll come back to that fundamental corruption.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">I will begin with the contributions I found easiest  to deal with, because that fundamental question does not reside at their  hearts. Seven essays address the pharmaceutical industry and the dilemmas raised  by its entanglements with health care providers and scientific research. The  essays include: Paul <span class=\"SpellE\">Menzel\xE2\x80\x99s</span> on patents (is the  protection of intellectual property justified in the face of intractable disease  among the developing nations?); Tom Beauchamp\xE2\x80\x99s on the tendency to exploit the disadvantaged in pharmaceutical research (who, after all, is going to  become a \"healthy normal volunteer\" for the trial regimens?); Jason Hubbard\xE2\x80\x99s on the notorious corruption of the medical profession in the practices of pharmaceutical marketing (\"detailing\"); Denis Arnold\xE2\x80\x99s on the ramifications of \"direct to consumer\" marketing, (an excellent survey of the types of pharmaceutical marketing to consumers and the  regulations supposedly governing them -- pointing out, among other criticisms, that  the warnings of adverse effects are nowhere carried out with the precision  that the law is assumed to demand); Carl Elliott\xE2\x80\x99s consideration of the role of industry-sponsorship in bioethics committee and IRB review -- industry sponsorship of IRB review?! (<span class=\"GramE\">he</span> suggests that  there should be no financial ties between those who serve on such committees  and the industries interested in their results -- and where there are such ties,  they should be cut); and Richard <span class=\"SpellE\">DeGeorge\xE2\x80\x99s</span>  solid, if qualified, praise for the pharmaceutical industry. I find these essays excellent, and the problems they call attention to real, yet not  fundamental to the problem of the book. At bottom, the pharmaceutical industry is a  business, falling well within the purview of business ethics. Those of us who have  been in business ethics for some years recognize the problems (the practice  in question: harms consumers or the community; is a conflict of interest or  at least appears to be such; violates law, harms the environment, or  otherwise intrudes on the public). We know how to recognize and suggest  appropriate remedies (the industry must be forbidden by law to engage in certain  practices, or must employ means to disclose fully the nature of the product or the  processes by which it is marketed; all deceptive practices must be stopped). As  long as there is not a real human being, sick and in need of care, in the  picture, we are on solid ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">The most ominous of these essays, by Dan <span class=\"SpellE\">Wikler</span>, explores the invasion of medical education  and practice by the pharmaceutical industry and by all makers of medical  devices that need government approval and professional acceptance to become  profitable. He demonstrates, more thoroughly than I would have thought possible, the entangling corruption of the medical profession, a state that he finds  to be on the brink of the utter destruction of our trust in our physicians. He  comes closest to the deep wound of commercial involvement found in Arnold's  initial question, and is sufficiently alarmed to call for a new review of all  medical education and practice, a \"Flexner II\" that will recommend sweeping reforms for the entire profession. I'll get back to Flexner II at the  end of the review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">This volume taps the long-standing ethics expertise  of many of those mentioned above. Of its eleven essays, the first is by Dan Callahan himself, \"Medicine and the Market,\" in which he undertakes to find a sensible framework for the \"medicine market debate,\" so that we can at least argue intelligently about it. The anger of the old  school medical ethicists (Edmund Pellegrino, Arnold <span class=\"SpellE\">Relman</span>) at the commercialism of current practice has to be set against the  inevitable rise in the costs of health care and the need for institutions outside individual medical practices to provide the efficiency, quality, and  cost control demanded by the public. Callahan correctly identifies the  central division on the question of health care as a conflict of values. On the individual level, does freedom/autonomy (the consumer's preference and  choice) trump beneficence/welfare (the consumer's health and long life)? Is it <i style=\"\">right</i> for me to indulge my taste for hamburgers, candy and beer, as my Type II diabetes worsens? And then,  does the collective freedom of hamburgers, etc. trump the collective interest in  keeping health care costs down? Callahan briefly examines the costs, and  results, of health care in the US and in other developed countries, concluding, as  have many others, that we seem to get less bang for the buck than we have  every right to expect, noting the different habits of thought that divide us  from the rest of the world. Europe, for instance, does not share our enthusiasm  for advances in medical technology, responsible for up to 50% of our cost increases.  Callahan concludes with the observation that the free-market rewards many  practices, but not the promotion of human health. If health is what we want<i style=\"\">  </i>(and it is not clear that it is), the practices of the market must be subordinated to the goal of universal  health care.<b style=\"\"><i style=\"\"> </i></b>Right now we have few ways of doing that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Norm Daniels, whose contribution immediately follows Callahan's, has been evaluating health care systems through the value of justice for (he estimates) three decades now. His unsurprising  conclusion is that market practices, general and specific, have not turned out to be  and will not turn out to be compatible with justice. In the course of  transforming healthcare, he argues, the arrival of profit-oriented institutions has  been eased by the promises they made when they arrived. Examples of this  include: that the onset of competition among healthcare providers would lower  unit costs and save a lot of money (just as competition among handheld calculators  in the early 1970s resulted in vastly lower prices for each); that competition  among health plans would lower the cost of health insurance; that  high-deductible healthcare plans would cause more rational purchasing and lower costs;  that competition among drug plans would lower the cost overall; and finally,  Daniels throws in the promise that the introduction of user fees and reliance on  the private sector in developing nations would lower costs for the poorest  people in the world. All these promises have been broken, he shows, leaving us  with an unworkable healthcare system characterized by gross injustices. A lesson  to be learned: it costs a for-profit entity nothing to make promises as vague  and unsecured as the promises he cites, and there is no penalty for breaking  them. Do we have any institutional way of making sure promises are kept? I don't  think so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">One of the more significant essays in the book is  \"The Third Face of Medicine: Ethics, Business and Challenges to  Professionalism,\" by Mary Rorty, Patricia <span class=\"SpellE\">Werhane</span>, and Ann  Mills. This trio has been arguing for the importance of \"organizational ethics,\" a field that combines business ethics and bioethics, for some years. For  a while we were able to maintain a journal of that title. It never caught on;  possibly it was premature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Or possibly its fundamental idea was incoherent.  This essay is most useful for incorporating in its body the confusions that  it accurately identifies. The authors point out in the first paragraphs  that the new struggles with cost control threaten to displace the historical  commitments of the physician to the welfare of the individual patient and to the  progress of medical science through clinical research. (The analogy between the  conflict of commitments embodied in the recruitment of patients, or people who at  least thought they were patients, into clinical trials as research subjects,  and the conflict embodied in the practice of \"medicine\" for physician profit, does not work.) They accurately track the corporatization of medicine,  from the solo practice to the enormous complexity of the contemporary surgical  suite, the enormous growth of the for-profit enterprises in the industry (and  their triumph after the failure of the Clinton Health Care plan of the 1990s).  They correctly point out that \"market\" mechanisms, premised on the freedom of every consumer to make \"his own\" choices and take full responsibility for them, do not fit the provision of health care in the  U.S. now. The worst confusion, they point out, is in what they call the  \"bifurcation\" of the health care consumer, where the employer (or the government)  makes the purchases for unknown consumers, while the patient and physician, who  may or may not be employed by the insurer, make the treatment decisions. They  do not use the category of \"moral hazard\" to describe this condition, but it fits the definition: the person choosing to take the risks, or incur the  costs, will not have to pay for the consequences. At some points they seem to recognize that the purpose of a for-profit enterprise is to make money,  to arrange for income to exceed costs by a margin that will satisfy  investors, and that this legal responsibility must trump concern for \"quality of care\" in all such enterprises. In the end, however, they come back to the  belief that the for-profit enterprises can be \"disciplined\" into adopting goals aligned with traditional medical practice. They do not establish this  belief, and their Stakeholder diagrams do not help. (If anything, the diagrams  seem designed to show that the whole field of health care is much too complex  to understand rationally. It is not.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Is healthcare -- the term that has replaced \"the practice of medicine\" -- to be understood as a complex of profit-seeking institutions, individual and corporate, or as professional service,  oriented to the health of the individual? In an interesting essay aimed at  reconciling the two approaches, George <span class=\"SpellE\">Khushf</span> characterizes  the \"traditional biomedical approach\" not as the physician-patient encounter, but as the depersonalized practice represented by machines and tubes, invading the  patient as object, identified as a case, not a person. He traces the rise of  mechanical medicine to the Flexner Report, claiming that its emphasis on scientific medicine turned patients into things, and encouraged physicians to  practice \"paternalism,\" making all decisions for the patient, since only they knew the mechanics  of the body. (<span class=\"SpellE\">Khushf</span> characterizes the traditional biomedical model as it was exemplified by Michael Bayles in his paper,  \"Disease as Mechanical Breakdown, Physicians as Body Mechanics,\" delivered in London, Western Ontario, in the 1970s. The problematic rise of  fragmentation of medical care came from the same insistence on science and the object; I  do <span class=\"SpellE\">carburetors</span>, not transmissions.) The  bioethics response to such mechanical ways of looking at medicine re-emphasized the  traditional understanding, and demanded a higher level of personal communication and concern. Paul Ramsey (<i style=\"\">The Patient as Person) </i>and Eric <span class=\"SpellE\">Cassell</span> (<i style=\"\">The  Healer's Art</i>), along with the continuing work of Edmund Pellegrino, typified the resistance to such mechanism. The insistence on patient autonomy, represented by the demand for informed consent to all  medical procedures, came out of this counter movement. So far so good<span class=\"GramE\">;</span> that opposition was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">But the alternative to the mechanical model,  advanced by those traditionalists, was a medical encounter characterized by a  greater appreciation of human suffering and the patient's own values, to  moderate the aggressive imposition of treatments by a newly confident scientific  medicine. <span class=\"SpellE\">Khushf</span> takes such discussions as  \"micro-ethical,\" making bioethics complicit with the <span class=\"SpellE\">Flexnerian</span>  model of \"scientific\" medicine, citing as evidence the rejection of Leon <span class=\"SpellE\">Kass's</span> work by the bioethics community as  \"unscientific.\" (The rejections of Leon <span class=\"SpellE\">Kass's</span> work that I  am familiar with do not call him unscientific, they call him wrong.  Possibly just ultraconservative, but anyway wrong.) <span class=\"SpellE\">Khushf</span>  suggests that the remedy for the insulated scientific model is not even  approached by contemporary bioethics, which he takes to be, following Jonathan <span class=\"SpellE\">Imber</span>, the \"Public Relations branch of modern medicine.\" As evidence of the failure, he cites the SUPPORT study, which signally failed to improve, or even change, the practices of hospitals, practices that were in violation of informed consent and hospital  policy. After a brief survey of the 1980s work of George Engel to re-conceive medicine  as \"<span class=\"SpellE\">biopsychosocial</span>,\" which had, in his  view, at least the merit of bringing society back into the picture, he then urges an  integration of Engel with the \"systems approach\" of the IOM proposals of the 1990s. The normative agenda of organizational ethics requires a systems approach. But ways of constructing ethics are dependent on the dominant  view of medicine, <span class=\"GramE\">meaning that</span> \"The altered material conditions of medicine <span class=\"SpellE\">problematize</span> not just medicine, but these dominant traditions of ethics.\" <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span class=\"SpellE\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Khushf</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> concludes that healthcare is now practiced not by individuals but by institutions; therefore, we must understand health holistically.  Healthcare is broader than medicine, and works toward the health of communities. As a  result, there is a new dialectic between normative and scientific aspects of  healthcare. We have moved away from the \"doctor-patient\" dyad, to the \"healthcare institution-patient population\" dyad, away from the paradigm of the patient's search for a \"cure\" and into the larger arena of institutional \"care.\"<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">I wish I understood what he has in mind. If all he means is that blaming individuals for errors in treatment is not  worthwhile, and that we must seek institutional means (like checklists -- you must  read <span class=\"SpellE\">Atul</span> <span class=\"SpellE\">Gawande's</span>  <i style=\"\">New Yorker </i>article on Peter <span class=\"SpellE\">Pronovost</span>,  and on the way checklists save lives) to improve health care, that's fine. But if he means that institutional goals and priorities must take the place of the old medical priorities, I would  note that most of the institutions now involved in healthcare have the priority of  making money, and I tremble to think where medicine will go from here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Let me try to pinpoint the major incongruity in the business/healthcare topic. In the manner of all other animals, we are  born generally healthy, and if we have food and shelter supplied in the  natural way, we will stay healthy until something happens (germs, falls, <span class=\"SpellE\">tumors</span>, etc.) to damage that state. We all have grandfathers (Arnold is a  different generation, so maybe I generalize inaccurately) who worked all their  lives, and boasted that they had never seen a doctor. Unless you need to, there's  no reason to. Health is natural; healthcare is not. And you never had to  pay a penny for that health. Matter of fact, what you have to do to preserve  that health doesn't cost anything either -- don't smoke, don't eat candy or  fast food, walk to work -- in fact, they save money. So where does  \"healthcare insurance\" figure in?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Contrast the clearer case of fire insurance. If you own a home, you paid a lot of money for it; that was a major investment.  It makes sense to insure that investment, hence fire insurance. If you have  a fire, the insurance should give you enough money to rebuild or replace.  If you have no insurance, you are out every penny, without recourse. You have  to pay the whole amount for a new home out of current income or savings. Fires  are few and far between, so fire insurance does not cost very much. The whole arrangement makes sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">But none of that makes sense for health. There was  no investment, and unless evil things happen, there is no maintenance. You  have no way of knowing how much (if any) insurance you will need, for you cannot  put a price on your health and life (since you paid nothing to acquire them),  even if you could foresee the future insults to your health, which you can't.  For those who argue globally that the price of healthcare is \"too high,\" there is a global answer: for the entire history of the human race, we have passionately desired freedom from pain and a long active life, for  ourselves. We can't pay \"too much\" to have these. By a small extension, we want the same for friends, family, and, I'd wager, long-term patients. After life  and health and painlessness, we want money. If the money comes at the  expense of our own, or our friends' pain, or death, it's no go; life is worth more.  But if it comes at the expense of a stranger's pain, some anonymous faraway  person, we have traditionally seen no moral problem. Now that we are civilized, we  are supposed to be ruled by charity and mercy, for the stranger as well as  for our own, but the business system was not set up to be so ruled. What the  current healthcare/insurance system does is import the \"moral hazard\" noted above to the entirety of dealings with patients. If we are an insurance company contemplating  the effects of our policies and practices, we don't care about the pain they produce, or countenance, and as long as we have investors scanning the quarterly returns, it is impossible that we should. Has anyone raised  the suggestion that the entirety of healthcare should be consigned to the  third sector, supported by individual payments as possible, and by taxes as necessary, but under the governance of not-for-profit institutions? If  not, let me be the first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">I promised I'd get back to Dan <span class=\"SpellE\">Wikler</span> and his proposed \"Flexner II.\" This might be a good way to finish this review: We need a thorough re-evaluation of the practice of  medicine (or \"healthcare\") of every description, to separate it from the profit machines of the  insurance industry, to re-orient patient care toward the health of the patient,  and just possibly, to lay out a plan to keep people healthy with many, many fewer medical interventions. I think that Flexner II would be a very good  idea.</span>"

The  essays include: Paul <span class=\"SpellE\">Menzel\xE2\x80\x99s</span> on patents (is the  protection of intellectual property justified in the face of intractable disease  among the developing nations?); Tom Beauchamp\xE2\x80\x99s on the tendency to exploit the disadvantaged in pharmaceutical research (who, after all, is going to  become a \"healthy normal volunteer\" for the trial regimens?); Jason Hubbard\xE2\x80\x99s on the notorious corruption of the medical profession in the practices of pharmaceutical marketing (\"detailing\"); Denis Arnold\xE2\x80\x99s on the ramifications of \"direct to consumer\" marketing, (an excellent survey of the types of pharmaceutical marketing to consumers and the  regulations supposedly governing them -- pointing out, among other criticisms, that  the warnings of adverse effects are nowhere carried out with the precision  that the law is assumed to demand); Carl Elliott\xE2\x80\x99s consideration of the role of industry-sponsorship in bioethics committee and IRB review -- industry sponsorship of IRB review?! (<span class=\"GramE\">he</span> suggests that  there should be no financial ties between those who serve on such committees  and the industries interested in their results -- and where there are such ties,  they should be cut); and Richard <span class=\"SpellE\">DeGeorge\xE2\x80\x99s</span>  solid, if qualified, praise for the pharmaceutical industry. I find these essays excellent, and the problems they call attention to real, yet not  fundamental to the problem of the book. At bottom, the pharmaceutical industry is a  business, falling well within the purview of business ethics. Those of us who have  been in business ethics for some years recognize the problems (the practice  in question: harms consumers or the community; is a conflict of interest or  at least appears to be such; violates law, harms the environment, or  otherwise intrudes on the public). We know how to recognize and suggest  appropriate remedies (the industry must be forbidden by law to engage in certain  practices, or must employ means to disclose fully the nature of the product or the  processes by which it is marketed; all deceptive practices must be stopped). As  long as there is not a real human being, sick and in need of care, in the  picture, we are on solid ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">The most ominous of these essays, by Dan <span class=\"SpellE\">Wikler</span>, explores the invasion of medical education  and practice by the pharmaceutical industry and by all makers of medical  devices that need government approval and professional acceptance to become  profitable. He demonstrates, more thoroughly than I would have thought possible, the entangling corruption of the medical profession, a state that he finds  to be on the brink of the utter destruction of our trust in our physicians. He  comes closest to the deep wound of commercial involvement found in Arnold's  initial question, and is sufficiently alarmed to call for a new review of all  medical education and practice, a \"Flexner II\" that will recommend sweeping reforms for the entire profession. I'll get back to Flexner II at the  end of the review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">This volume taps the long-standing ethics expertise  of many of those mentioned above. Of its eleven essays, the first is by Dan Callahan himself, \"Medicine and the Market,\" in which he undertakes to find a sensible framework for the \"medicine market debate,\" so that we can at least argue intelligently about it. The anger of the old  school medical ethicists (Edmund Pellegrino, Arnold <span class=\"SpellE\">Relman</span>) at the commercialism of current practice has to be set against the  inevitable rise in the costs of health care and the need for institutions outside individual medical practices to provide the efficiency, quality, and  cost control demanded by the public. Callahan correctly identifies the  central division on the question of health care as a conflict of values. On the individual level, does freedom/autonomy (the consumer's preference and  choice) trump beneficence/welfare (the consumer's health and long life)? Is it <i style=\"\">right</i> for me to indulge my taste for hamburgers, candy and beer, as my Type II diabetes worsens? And then,  does the collective freedom of hamburgers, etc. trump the collective interest in  keeping health care costs down? Callahan briefly examines the costs, and  results, of health care in the US and in other developed countries, concluding, as  have many others, that we seem to get less bang for the buck than we have  every right to expect, noting the different habits of thought that divide us  from the rest of the world. Europe, for instance, does not share our enthusiasm  for advances in medical technology, responsible for up to 50% of our cost increases.  Callahan concludes with the observation that the free-market rewards many  practices, but not the promotion of human health. If health is what we want<i style=\"\">  </i>(and it is not clear that it is), the practices of the market must be subordinated to the goal of universal  health care.<b style=\"\"><i style=\"\"> </i></b>Right now we have few ways of doing that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Norm Daniels, whose contribution immediately follows Callahan's, has been evaluating health care systems through the value of justice for (he estimates) three decades now. His unsurprising  conclusion is that market practices, general and specific, have not turned out to be  and will not turn out to be compatible with justice. In the course of  transforming healthcare, he argues, the arrival of profit-oriented institutions has  been eased by the promises they made when they arrived. Examples of this  include: that the onset of competition among healthcare providers would lower  unit costs and save a lot of money (just as competition among handheld calculators  in the early 1970s resulted in vastly lower prices for each); that competition  among health plans would lower the cost of health insurance; that  high-deductible healthcare plans would cause more rational purchasing and lower costs;  that competition among drug plans would lower the cost overall; and finally,  Daniels throws in the promise that the introduction of user fees and reliance on  the private sector in developing nations would lower costs for the poorest  people in the world. All these promises have been broken, he shows, leaving us  with an unworkable healthcare system characterized by gross injustices. A lesson  to be learned: it costs a for-profit entity nothing to make promises as vague  and unsecured as the promises he cites, and there is no penalty for breaking  them. Do we have any institutional way of making sure promises are kept? I don't  think so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">One of the more significant essays in the book is  \"The Third Face of Medicine: Ethics, Business and Challenges to  Professionalism,\" by Mary Rorty, Patricia <span class=\"SpellE\">Werhane</span>, and Ann  Mills. This trio has been arguing for the importance of \"organizational ethics,\" a field that combines business ethics and bioethics, for some years. For  a while we were able to maintain a journal of that title. It never caught on;  possibly it was premature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Or possibly its fundamental idea was incoherent.  This essay is most useful for incorporating in its body the confusions that  it accurately identifies. The authors point out in the first paragraphs  that the new struggles with cost control threaten to displace the historical  commitments of the physician to the welfare of the individual patient and to the  progress of medical science through clinical research. (The analogy between the  conflict of commitments embodied in the recruitment of patients, or people who at  least thought they were patients, into clinical trials as research subjects,  and the conflict embodied in the practice of \"medicine\" for physician profit, does not work.) They accurately track the corporatization of medicine,  from the solo practice to the enormous complexity of the contemporary surgical  suite, the enormous growth of the for-profit enterprises in the industry (and  their triumph after the failure of the Clinton Health Care plan of the 1990s).  They correctly point out that \"market\" mechanisms, premised on the freedom of every consumer to make \"his own\" choices and take full responsibility for them, do not fit the provision of health care in the  U.S. now. The worst confusion, they point out, is in what they call the  \"bifurcation\" of the health care consumer, where the employer (or the government)  makes the purchases for unknown consumers, while the patient and physician, who  may or may not be employed by the insurer, make the treatment decisions. They  do not use the category of \"moral hazard\" to describe this condition, but it fits the definition: the person choosing to take the risks, or incur the  costs, will not have to pay for the consequences. At some points they seem to recognize that the purpose of a for-profit enterprise is to make money,  to arrange for income to exceed costs by a margin that will satisfy  investors, and that this legal responsibility must trump concern for \"quality of care\" in all such enterprises. In the end, however, they come back to the  belief that the for-profit enterprises can be \"disciplined\" into adopting goals aligned with traditional medical practice. They do not establish this  belief, and their Stakeholder diagrams do not help. (If anything, the diagrams  seem designed to show that the whole field of health care is much too complex  to understand rationally. It is not.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Is healthcare -- the term that has replaced \"the practice of medicine\" -- to be understood as a complex of profit-seeking institutions, individual and corporate, or as professional service,  oriented to the health of the individual? In an interesting essay aimed at  reconciling the two approaches, George <span class=\"SpellE\">Khushf</span> characterizes  the \"traditional biomedical approach\" not as the physician-patient encounter, but as the depersonalized practice represented by machines and tubes, invading the  patient as object, identified as a case, not a person. He traces the rise of  mechanical medicine to the Flexner Report, claiming that its emphasis on scientific medicine turned patients into things, and encouraged physicians to  practice \"paternalism,\" making all decisions for the patient, since only they knew the mechanics  of the body. (<span class=\"SpellE\">Khushf</span> characterizes the traditional biomedical model as it was exemplified by Michael Bayles in his paper,  \"Disease as Mechanical Breakdown, Physicians as Body Mechanics,\" delivered in London, Western Ontario, in the 1970s. The problematic rise of  fragmentation of medical care came from the same insistence on science and the object; I  do <span class=\"SpellE\">carburetors</span>, not transmissions.) The  bioethics response to such mechanical ways of looking at medicine re-emphasized the  traditional understanding, and demanded a higher level of personal communication and concern. Paul Ramsey (<i style=\"\">The Patient as Person) </i>and Eric <span class=\"SpellE\">Cassell</span> (<i style=\"\">The  Healer's Art</i>), along with the continuing work of Edmund Pellegrino, typified the resistance to such mechanism. The insistence on patient autonomy, represented by the demand for informed consent to all  medical procedures, came out of this counter movement. So far so good<span class=\"GramE\">;</span> that opposition was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">But the alternative to the mechanical model,  advanced by those traditionalists, was a medical encounter characterized by a  greater appreciation of human suffering and the patient's own values, to  moderate the aggressive imposition of treatments by a newly confident scientific  medicine. <span class=\"SpellE\">Khushf</span> takes such discussions as  \"micro-ethical,\" making bioethics complicit with the <span class=\"SpellE\">Flexnerian</span>  model of \"scientific\" medicine, citing as evidence the rejection of Leon <span class=\"SpellE\">Kass's</span> work by the bioethics community as  \"unscientific.\" (The rejections of Leon <span class=\"SpellE\">Kass's</span> work that I  am familiar with do not call him unscientific, they call him wrong.  Possibly just ultraconservative, but anyway wrong.) <span class=\"SpellE\">Khushf</span>  suggests that the remedy for the insulated scientific model is not even  approached by contemporary bioethics, which he takes to be, following Jonathan <span class=\"SpellE\">Imber</span>, the \"Public Relations branch of modern medicine.\" As evidence of the failure, he cites the SUPPORT study, which signally failed to improve, or even change, the practices of hospitals, practices that were in violation of informed consent and hospital  policy. After a brief survey of the 1980s work of George Engel to re-conceive medicine  as \"<span class=\"SpellE\">biopsychosocial</span>,\" which had, in his  view, at least the merit of bringing society back into the picture, he then urges an  integration of Engel with the \"systems approach\" of the IOM proposals of the 1990s. The normative agenda of organizational ethics requires a systems approach. But ways of constructing ethics are dependent on the dominant  view of medicine, <span class=\"GramE\">meaning that</span> \"The altered material conditions of medicine <span class=\"SpellE\">problematize</span> not just medicine, but these dominant traditions of ethics.\" <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span class=\"SpellE\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Khushf</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> concludes that healthcare is now practiced not by individuals but by institutions; therefore, we must understand health holistically.  Healthcare is broader than medicine, and works toward the health of communities. As a  result, there is a new dialectic between normative and scientific aspects of  healthcare. We have moved away from the \"doctor-patient\" dyad, to the \"healthcare institution-patient population\" dyad, away from the paradigm of the patient's search for a \"cure\" and into the larger arena of institutional \"care.\"<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">I wish I understood what he has in mind. If all he means is that blaming individuals for errors in treatment is not  worthwhile, and that we must seek institutional means (like checklists -- you must  read <span class=\"SpellE\">Atul</span> <span class=\"SpellE\">Gawande's</span>  <i style=\"\">New Yorker </i>article on Peter <span class=\"SpellE\">Pronovost</span>,  and on the way checklists save lives) to improve health care, that's fine. But if he means that institutional goals and priorities must take the place of the old medical priorities, I would  note that most of the institutions now involved in healthcare have the priority of  making money, and I tremble to think where medicine will go from here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Let me try to pinpoint the major incongruity in the business/healthcare topic. In the manner of all other animals, we are  born generally healthy, and if we have food and shelter supplied in the  natural way, we will stay healthy until something happens (germs, falls, <span class=\"SpellE\">tumors</span>, etc.) to damage that state. We all have grandfathers (Arnold is a  different generation, so maybe I generalize inaccurately) who worked all their  lives, and boasted that they had never seen a doctor. Unless you need to, there's  no reason to. Health is natural; healthcare is not. And you never had to  pay a penny for that health. Matter of fact, what you have to do to preserve  that health doesn't cost anything either -- don't smoke, don't eat candy or  fast food, walk to work -- in fact, they save money. So where does  \"healthcare insurance\" figure in?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Contrast the clearer case of fire insurance. If you own a home, you paid a lot of money for it; that was a major investment.  It makes sense to insure that investment, hence fire insurance. If you have  a fire, the insurance should give you enough money to rebuild or replace.  If you have no insurance, you are out every penny, without recourse. You have  to pay the whole amount for a new home out of current income or savings. Fires  are few and far between, so fire insurance does not cost very much. The whole arrangement makes sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">But none of that makes sense for health. There was  no investment, and unless evil things happen, there is no maintenance. You  have no way of knowing how much (if any) insurance you will need, for you cannot  put a price on your health and life (since you paid nothing to acquire them),  even if you could foresee the future insults to your health, which you can't.  For those who argue globally that the price of healthcare is \"too high,\" there is a global answer: for the entire history of the human race, we have passionately desired freedom from pain and a long active life, for  ourselves. We can't pay \"too much\" to have these. By a small extension, we want the same for friends, family, and, I'd wager, long-term patients. After life  and health and painlessness, we want money. If the money comes at the  expense of our own, or our friends' pain, or death, it's no go; life is worth more.  But if it comes at the expense of a stranger's pain, some anonymous faraway  person, we have traditionally seen no moral problem. Now that we are civilized, we  are supposed to be ruled by charity and mercy, for the stranger as well as  for our own, but the business system was not set up to be so ruled. What the  current healthcare/insurance system does is import the \"moral hazard\" noted above to the entirety of dealings with patients. If we are an insurance company contemplating  the effects of our policies and practices, we don't care about the pain they produce, or countenance, and as long as we have investors scanning the quarterly returns, it is impossible that we should. Has anyone raised  the suggestion that the entirety of healthcare should be consigned to the  third sector, supported by individual payments as possible, and by taxes as necessary, but under the governance of not-for-profit institutions? If  not, let me be the first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">I promised I'd get back to Dan <span class=\"SpellE\">Wikler</span> and his proposed \"Flexner II.\" This might be a good way to finish this review: We need a thorough re-evaluation of the practice of  medicine (or \"healthcare\") of every description, to separate it from the profit machines of the  insurance industry, to re-orient patient care toward the health of the patient,  and just possibly, to lay out a plan to keep people healthy with many, many fewer medical interventions. I think that Flexner II would be a very good  idea.</span>"
