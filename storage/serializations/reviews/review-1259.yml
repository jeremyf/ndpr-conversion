content: "<p>Epistemologists worry mostly about what it takes for beliefs to qualify as knowledge or to be at least justified. It is generally taken for granted that people know what the contents of their beliefs are. But lately, in connection with externalism about content (not to be confused with externalism about knowledge or justified belief), a debate has arisen on whether we need empirical information in order to know the contents of our own beliefs. For example, in light of Putnam\xE2\x80\x99s classic Twin-Earth scenario, do we need the empirical information that the common clear liquid that falls as rain and fills lakes and rivers is H2O rather than XYZ in order to know that we believe water quenches thirst? Now Krista Lawlor has raised a rather different question about our access to the contents of our beliefs.</p>   \n\
  <p>This rigorously argued and meticulously written monograph is concerned with a very difficult question: what does it take to ensure that a thought ostensibly about a previously encountered individual really is about the individual one takes it to be about? This question may be couched in terms of validating the form of an inference. Consider the oldest inference in the book:</p>  \t <blockquote> \tAll men are mortal.\r\n\
  \t<u>Socrates is a man.\r\n\
  </u> \tSo, Socrates is mortal.  \t</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In order for this inference to be valid, \xE2\x80\x98Socrates\xE2\x80\x99 must refer to the same individual in both of its occurrences. Since there is no guarantee that it does, we need to be on guard against the possibility that it does not. Accordingly, Lawlor asks, \xE2\x80\x9Chow does one attain defeasible warrant for trading on the presumed coreference of one\xE2\x80\x99s mental terms?\xE2\x80\x9D (40), and seeks \xE2\x80\x9Can account of how it is that one\xE2\x80\x99s taking terms to corefer could be a good guide to one\xE2\x80\x99s terms actually coreferring\xE2\x80\x9D (45).</p>   \n\
  <p>It is important to understand that, contrary to what she advertises in the preface, Lawlor is not offering an account of singular thought itself. Although she does raise the question of \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat makes possible the possession of singular concepts\xE2\x80\x9D and indicates that \xE2\x80\x9Cthis book is an effort to answer that question\xE2\x80\x9D (xi), it is clear from the ensuing discussion that she is really addressing questions about the warranted exercise of singular concepts. She does not take up accounts of what is involved in thinking of an individual one is perceiving, remembers, or is informed of (see Evans 1982 for an original account and Bach 1987/1994 and Recanati 1993 for derivative ones), and she does not acknowledge the fundamental difference between thinking of an object in a <i>de re</i> way and merely under a description. In fact, it is unclear what sort of account of singular thought she favors, except that it utilizes the notion of sense. But we are told simply that sense is \xE2\x80\x9Cthat semantic entity that determines reference\xE2\x80\x9D (7).</p>   \n\
  <p>Lawlor begins by considering Paul Boghossian\xE2\x80\x99s well-known contention, in regard to Twin-Earth thought-experiments, that semantic externalism is incompatible with the \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemic transparency of thought\xE2\x80\x9D (5), entailing that one cannot know <i>a priori</i> the logical properties of one\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts. Externalism seems to imply that a trans-world traveler must be aware of empirical facts to know, e.g., that he is thinking that water quenches thirst. Lawlor is not so much interested in this issue (there is now an extensive literature on it) as she is in pointing out that it is symptomatic of a much more down-to-earth problem: \xE2\x80\x9Cordinary lapses of attention, ordinary mishaps and swaps of referents will make <i>a priori</i> certainty in the matter of sameness of reference at different times impossible\xE2\x80\x9D (14). We are all \xE2\x80\x9Csusceptible to equivocation\xE2\x80\x9D (13), she cautions, but even if we cannot achieve perfect certainty, she assures us that we can generally avoid error about our references by exercising \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemic vigilance ... in thinking of things as the same. ... One\xE2\x80\x99s warrant in making trades on presumed coreference derives from one\xE2\x80\x99s own efforts to make sure that the presuppositions of one\xE2\x80\x99s inferences hold true\xE2\x80\x9D (21).</p>   \n\
  <p>In the second chapter Lawlor examines John Campbell\xE2\x80\x99s (1987) effort to develop an account of sense as \xE2\x80\x9Cdiachronically transparent,\xE2\x80\x9D and in the third chapter she examines Ruth Millikan\xE2\x80\x99s (1997) account of \xE2\x80\x9Cthinking with coreferential purport\xE2\x80\x9D (this is Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s admittedly \xE2\x80\x9Cugly\xE2\x80\x9D catch phrase, not Millikan\xE2\x80\x99s), as well as what she calls the \xE2\x80\x9Cnode\xE2\x80\x9D model. Her critique of these accounts is incisive but constructive. By successively identifying various suggestive difficulties in the other accounts, she progressively sets the stage for her own. For example, instead of abandoning the standard context-independent notion of validity, as Campbell does, she proposes that one can have <i>a priori</i> access to the contents of one\xE2\x80\x99s own thoughts and inferences without having to be infallible about them. Thus she reconciles <i>a priori</i> access with defeasibility. Also, she shows why the node model cannot represent how we can tentatively accept an identity or even undo the acceptance of one.</p>   \n\
  <p>In the last two chapters, Lawlor develops her own account. Unfortunately, she does not clearly separate what is involved in (a) \xE2\x80\x9Cknowing the logical powers of one\xE2\x80\x99s inferences\xE2\x80\x9D (71), (b) continuing to believe things about something, (c) coming to believe new things about something one already has beliefs about, and (d) re-identifying something previously encountered (more examples would have been helpful). She adopts (and adapts) the popular metaphor of files of information to explain what is involved in maintaining defeasible warrant for \xE2\x80\x9Ctrading on presumed coreference.\xE2\x80\x9D The epistemic vigilance required for achieving this requires \xE2\x80\x9Cestablishing and maintaining a tradition or policy of use of a mental term type ... and of maintaining a file about (purportedly) an individual ... [by using] various sorts of file-management\xE2\x80\x9D (23). Here is her main thesis:</p>  \t\t <blockquote>one is warranted in trading on presumed coreference just in case (i) one attempts to maintain an intentional relation to a referent, and (ii) one is reliable in one\xE2\x80\x99s attempt, and (iii) one has some access to the grounds of one\xE2\x80\x99s reliability, and (iv) one\xE2\x80\x99s reliability in this matter arises from one\xE2\x80\x99s epistemic vigilance. (72)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The plausibility of this half internalist, half externalist thesis rests partly on Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s subtle exposure of deficiencies in other views and partly on the appeal of her file-management model and her account of how the \xE2\x80\x9Csensitivity to one\xE2\x80\x99s files\xE2\x80\x9D (91) needed for epistemic vigilance consists in \xE2\x80\x9Ca disposition to self-correction, ... to correct one\xE2\x80\x99s screening and pruning dispositions\xE2\x80\x9D (107).</p>   \n\
  <p>Space does not permit discussing Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s account in detail. She aims to respond to the skeptical suggestion that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe sense of a mental term tokened in one thought might differ from the sense of another term of the same type in a second thought, without the thinker\xE2\x80\x99s <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the difference,\xE2\x80\x9D (27), and attempts to flesh out what underlies \xE2\x80\x9Cthinking with coreferential purport\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ctrading on presumed coreference.\xE2\x80\x9D She does this by explaining the benefits of \xE2\x80\x9Csensitivity to one\xE2\x80\x99s files\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cdetection of one\xE2\x80\x99s own characteristic screening and pruning dispositions,\xE2\x80\x9D provided these dispositions have the required reliability. Her discussion takes a decidedly pragmatic turn and, despite how she originally posed her main question, it seems to me that she does not attend enough to the representational requirements on the \xE2\x80\x9Cmechanics of coreferential thinking.\xE2\x80\x9D She often alludes to the handling and management of information without adequately considering how this information is represented. But that is part of the question at issue, since the same information can be represented in different ways.</p>   \n\
  <p>Recall that Lawlor is trying to give \xE2\x80\x9Can account of how it is that one\xE2\x80\x99s taking terms to corefer could be a good guide to one\xE2\x80\x99s terms actually coreferring.\xE2\x80\x9D This seems to presuppose that we are somehow in a position to manage and manipulate their own mental representations. Even if we do not do this actively and reflectively but merely have unreflective but sensitive dispositions for doing this, we must somehow have cognitive access to our mental representations in order to monitor them. I don\xE2\x80\x99t know about you, but my mental representations are utterly opaque to me. The best I can do is recognize what words I am inclined to use to express my thoughts. When I think about Socrates, for example, I am unaware of the vehicle whereby I think of him, and I am unaware of any sense associated with that vehicle. Insofar as I might ask myself whether I am thinking of the same guy as before when I am disposed to use the name \xE2\x80\x98Socrates\xE2\x80\x99 to refer (or during the course of an inference like the classic one about Socrates\xE2\x80\x99 being mortal), I am asking a question about my use of the natural language name \xE2\x80\x98Socrates\xE2\x80\x99, not the mental representation whereby I think of him. Unless I am badly misconstruing Lawlor, a possibility I cannot rule out given the intelligence displayed on every page of this book, the question she is addressing is predicated on the undefended assumption that we are in a position to represent our mental representations, the vehicles by which they think of individuals (and their properties and relations). (Lawlor herself is neutral about the nature of these vehicles\xE2\x80\x94she does \xE2\x80\x9Cnot endorse the \xE2\x80\x99language of thought\xE2\x80\x99 hypothesis\xE2\x80\x9D (5n) but offers no alternative to it.)</p>   \n\
  <p>The meta-representational capacity that Lawlor seems to assume we have also includes the capacity to think of the senses of representations. In this regard she apparently goes further than Frege, who did not suppose that when we \xE2\x80\x9Cgrasp\xE2\x80\x9D the sense of a term we are aware of its sense (along with its referent). Lawlor rejects Campbell\xE2\x80\x99s assumption that \xE2\x80\x9Cgrasping sameness [must] guarantee that one knows that terms which purport to corefer actually do corefer,\xE2\x80\x9D and opts for the view that \xE2\x80\x9Csomething weaker might suffice to warrant a thinker in trading on coreference,\xE2\x80\x9D supposing that this weaker accomplishment \xE2\x80\x9Cinvolves both one\xE2\x80\x99s grasping a sense and its seeming to one that one grasps sameness of sense\xE2\x80\x9D (72). At first she makes it sound as though only reflective thinkers can exercise the requisite epistemic vigilance: \xE2\x80\x9CUnreflective thinkers, thinkers who are not on guard against error, and who take no particular precautions in their inferences, are in fact susceptible to equivocation ... [and] simply rely on their mental term types to do the job\xE2\x80\x9D (13). But later she suggests that \xE2\x80\x9Cone\xE2\x80\x99s unreflective epistemic dispositions are ... the place to look for the source of one\xE2\x80\x99s justification in taking mental terms to corefer\xE2\x80\x9D and that \xE2\x80\x9Cgrasping a sense ... involve[s] those of unreflective mechanisms\xE2\x80\x94mechanisms whose net effect is to make one reliable about having thought of the Same\xE2\x80\x9D (22). Even if these mechanisms are unreflective, it would seem, at least as she formulates her main question, that sensitivity to the sorts of things necessary for maintaining epistemic vigilance about coreference requires some ability to have thoughts about one\xE2\x80\x99s mental representations and their senses. Otherwise, how can this sensitivity be realized? How can these mechanisms operate without representations to operate on?</p>   \n\
  <p>Even if we grant the meta-representational assumption, there seems to be a further difficulty. If we can monitor our mental representations and engage in the sort of cognitive bookkeeping Lawlor imagines, her question concerning thinking new thoughts about old things becomes a question concerning thinking new thoughts about old mental representations. That is, the epistemic demand that she thinks we must meet in order not to think about the wrong thing can only be met if we meet the further demand not to think with the wrong mental representation. But that requires monitoring these representations. So it seems that the meta-representational assumption combined with Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s views about cognitive bookkeeping leads to a vicious regress. The problem about tracking objects, which her account is supposed to solve, resurfaces as a problem about tracking their representations.</p>   \n\
  <p>Curiously, at one point Lawlor notes that her \xE2\x80\x9Cformulation in meta-linguistic terms, rather than object-level terms ..., is required to prevent a regress\xE2\x80\x9D (28n), and later makes clear the futility of making a \xE2\x80\x9Cmediate\xE2\x80\x9D inference involving a \xE2\x80\x9Cmiddle term\xE2\x80\x9D (these are Millikan\xE2\x80\x99s terms). For example, in regard to the argument that Socrates is mortal, the problem of ensuring that the two occurrences of \xE2\x80\x98Socrates\xE2\x80\x99 corefer can\xE2\x80\x99t be solved by inserting subscripts and adding an identity premise:</p> \t\t <blockquote> All men are mortal.\r\n\
  Socrates<sub>1</sub> is a man.\r\n\
  <u>Socrates</u><sub>1</sub><u> is Socrates</u><sub>2</sub>.\r\n\
  So, Socrates<sub>2</sub> is mortal. </blockquote>   \t\t \n\
  <p>Obviously the problem of coreference recurs, with respect to both the two occurrences of \xE2\x80\x98Socrates<sub>1</sub>\xE2\x80\x99 and the two occurrences of \xE2\x80\x98Socrates<sub>2</sub>\xE2\x80\x99. But it seems that Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s meta-representational account, insofar as it requires \xE2\x80\x9Cits seeming to one that one grasps sameness of sense,\xE2\x80\x9D involves a regress of its own.</p>   \n\
  <p>What is the alternative? Somehow we must able to keep our thoughts on particular individuals without having to guard against representational equivocation. Somehow, this capacity must be built into our cognitive architecture. Lawlor rightly points out that Perry\xE2\x80\x99s file-merge model of representing coreferential purport is too weak, in that it \xE2\x80\x9Cleaves one no room for merely pondering identifications\xE2\x80\x9D (63) and \xE2\x80\x9Ctoo little room for undoing coreferential thought\xE2\x80\x9D (64; see Forbes 1989 for some brief suggestions that provide for both), but it seems that the meta-representational demand imposed by her file-management model is too strong.</p>   \n\
  <p>Perhaps I have read too much into Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s model. She claims that we possess not just \xE2\x80\x9Ccapacities for reflective or meta-cognitive thought\xE2\x80\x9D but \xE2\x80\x9Cmany unreflective dispositions whose aim is the maintenance of correct information about individuals as individuals,\xE2\x80\x9D which are, she believes, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe place to look for the source of one\xE2\x80\x99s justification in taking mental terms to corefer\xE2\x80\x9D (22). Yet this very way of putting her point (\xE2\x80\x9Ctaking mental terms to corefer\xE2\x80\x9D) invokes the troubling meta-representational assumption. On the other hand, \xE2\x80\x9Cgrasping a sense again does involve a host of unreflective mechanisms\xE2\x80\x9D (22), in which \xE2\x80\x9Cwe must allow a certain degree of trust\xE2\x80\x9D (28). Her later (ch. 4) discussion of what these mechanisms do, and what they have to do in order for \xE2\x80\x9Ctrading on presumed coreference\xE2\x80\x9D to be warranted, does not really include an account of how they do what they do. Either these mechanisms do involve representations of one\xE2\x80\x99s representations (and their senses) or they do not. If they do, the problems mentioned above seem to arise. If they do not, then it is a mystery how they work. The only way out of this dilemma is to take a less internalist approach, one that does not require constant vigilance of the sort Lawlor demands. Then the capacity of warrant trading on presumed coreference would be built into our cognitive architecture and its natural workings, rather than on our vigilant control over it.</p>   \n\
  <p>This is a brilliant book in many ways. So I wonder whether my skepticism about people\xE2\x80\x99s ability to engage in meta-representational file management with the vigilance that Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s account seems to require isn\xE2\x80\x99t the product of some meta-representational blindspot. If her account of the mechanics of coreferential thinking and the dispositions it involves does not make the meta-representational assumption that it seems to make, it needs to include an account of how these dispositions get realized otherwise. The present monograph is actually her dissertation, and one hopes that in future work she will integrate her account of thinking new thoughts about old things with a theory of singular thought itself and develop it with the help of relevant ideas in cognitive science.</p>     \n\
  <p>Note: The publisher\xE2\x80\x99s copy editor was asleep at the wheel: there are scattered (harmless) typos, the index is skimpy, and many of the bibliographical references are incomplete (Millikan 1997 is cited as appearing in the wrong year in the wrong journal).\r\n\

She aims to respond to the skeptical suggestion that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe sense of a mental term tokened in one thought might differ from the sense of another term of the same type in a second thought, without the thinker\xE2\x80\x99s <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the difference,\xE2\x80\x9D (27), and attempts to flesh out what underlies \xE2\x80\x9Cthinking with coreferential purport\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ctrading on presumed coreference.\xE2\x80\x9D She does this by explaining the benefits of \xE2\x80\x9Csensitivity to one\xE2\x80\x99s files\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cdetection of one\xE2\x80\x99s own characteristic screening and pruning dispositions,\xE2\x80\x9D provided these dispositions have the required reliability. Her discussion takes a decidedly pragmatic turn and, despite how she originally posed her main question, it seems to me that she does not attend enough to the representational requirements on the \xE2\x80\x9Cmechanics of coreferential thinking.\xE2\x80\x9D She often alludes to the handling and management of information without adequately considering how this information is represented. But that is part of the question at issue, since the same information can be represented in different ways.</p>   \n\
  <p>Recall that Lawlor is trying to give \xE2\x80\x9Can account of how it is that one\xE2\x80\x99s taking terms to corefer could be a good guide to one\xE2\x80\x99s terms actually coreferring.\xE2\x80\x9D This seems to presuppose that we are somehow in a position to manage and manipulate their own mental representations. Even if we do not do this actively and reflectively but merely have unreflective but sensitive dispositions for doing this, we must somehow have cognitive access to our mental representations in order to monitor them. I don\xE2\x80\x99t know about you, but my mental representations are utterly opaque to me. The best I can do is recognize what words I am inclined to use to express my thoughts. When I think about Socrates, for example, I am unaware of the vehicle whereby I think of him, and I am unaware of any sense associated with that vehicle. Insofar as I might ask myself whether I am thinking of the same guy as before when I am disposed to use the name \xE2\x80\x98Socrates\xE2\x80\x99 to refer (or during the course of an inference like the classic one about Socrates\xE2\x80\x99 being mortal), I am asking a question about my use of the natural language name \xE2\x80\x98Socrates\xE2\x80\x99, not the mental representation whereby I think of him. Unless I am badly misconstruing Lawlor, a possibility I cannot rule out given the intelligence displayed on every page of this book, the question she is addressing is predicated on the undefended assumption that we are in a position to represent our mental representations, the vehicles by which they think of individuals (and their properties and relations). (Lawlor herself is neutral about the nature of these vehicles\xE2\x80\x94she does \xE2\x80\x9Cnot endorse the \xE2\x80\x99language of thought\xE2\x80\x99 hypothesis\xE2\x80\x9D (5n) but offers no alternative to it.)</p>   \n\
  <p>The meta-representational capacity that Lawlor seems to assume we have also includes the capacity to think of the senses of representations. In this regard she apparently goes further than Frege, who did not suppose that when we \xE2\x80\x9Cgrasp\xE2\x80\x9D the sense of a term we are aware of its sense (along with its referent). Lawlor rejects Campbell\xE2\x80\x99s assumption that \xE2\x80\x9Cgrasping sameness [must] guarantee that one knows that terms which purport to corefer actually do corefer,\xE2\x80\x9D and opts for the view that \xE2\x80\x9Csomething weaker might suffice to warrant a thinker in trading on coreference,\xE2\x80\x9D supposing that this weaker accomplishment \xE2\x80\x9Cinvolves both one\xE2\x80\x99s grasping a sense and its seeming to one that one grasps sameness of sense\xE2\x80\x9D (72). At first she makes it sound as though only reflective thinkers can exercise the requisite epistemic vigilance: \xE2\x80\x9CUnreflective thinkers, thinkers who are not on guard against error, and who take no particular precautions in their inferences, are in fact susceptible to equivocation ... [and] simply rely on their mental term types to do the job\xE2\x80\x9D (13). But later she suggests that \xE2\x80\x9Cone\xE2\x80\x99s unreflective epistemic dispositions are ... the place to look for the source of one\xE2\x80\x99s justification in taking mental terms to corefer\xE2\x80\x9D and that \xE2\x80\x9Cgrasping a sense ... involve[s] those of unreflective mechanisms\xE2\x80\x94mechanisms whose net effect is to make one reliable about having thought of the Same\xE2\x80\x9D (22). Even if these mechanisms are unreflective, it would seem, at least as she formulates her main question, that sensitivity to the sorts of things necessary for maintaining epistemic vigilance about coreference requires some ability to have thoughts about one\xE2\x80\x99s mental representations and their senses. Otherwise, how can this sensitivity be realized? How can these mechanisms operate without representations to operate on?</p>   \n\
  <p>Even if we grant the meta-representational assumption, there seems to be a further difficulty. If we can monitor our mental representations and engage in the sort of cognitive bookkeeping Lawlor imagines, her question concerning thinking new thoughts about old things becomes a question concerning thinking new thoughts about old mental representations. That is, the epistemic demand that she thinks we must meet in order not to think about the wrong thing can only be met if we meet the further demand not to think with the wrong mental representation. But that requires monitoring these representations. So it seems that the meta-representational assumption combined with Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s views about cognitive bookkeeping leads to a vicious regress. The problem about tracking objects, which her account is supposed to solve, resurfaces as a problem about tracking their representations.</p>   \n\
  <p>Curiously, at one point Lawlor notes that her \xE2\x80\x9Cformulation in meta-linguistic terms, rather than object-level terms ..., is required to prevent a regress\xE2\x80\x9D (28n), and later makes clear the futility of making a \xE2\x80\x9Cmediate\xE2\x80\x9D inference involving a \xE2\x80\x9Cmiddle term\xE2\x80\x9D (these are Millikan\xE2\x80\x99s terms). For example, in regard to the argument that Socrates is mortal, the problem of ensuring that the two occurrences of \xE2\x80\x98Socrates\xE2\x80\x99 corefer can\xE2\x80\x99t be solved by inserting subscripts and adding an identity premise:</p> \t\t <blockquote> All men are mortal.\r\n\
  Socrates<sub>1</sub> is a man.\r\n\
  <u>Socrates</u><sub>1</sub><u> is Socrates</u><sub>2</sub>.\r\n\
  So, Socrates<sub>2</sub> is mortal. </blockquote>   \t\t \n\
  <p>Obviously the problem of coreference recurs, with respect to both the two occurrences of \xE2\x80\x98Socrates<sub>1</sub>\xE2\x80\x99 and the two occurrences of \xE2\x80\x98Socrates<sub>2</sub>\xE2\x80\x99. But it seems that Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s meta-representational account, insofar as it requires \xE2\x80\x9Cits seeming to one that one grasps sameness of sense,\xE2\x80\x9D involves a regress of its own.</p>   \n\
  <p>What is the alternative? Somehow we must able to keep our thoughts on particular individuals without having to guard against representational equivocation. Somehow, this capacity must be built into our cognitive architecture. Lawlor rightly points out that Perry\xE2\x80\x99s file-merge model of representing coreferential purport is too weak, in that it \xE2\x80\x9Cleaves one no room for merely pondering identifications\xE2\x80\x9D (63) and \xE2\x80\x9Ctoo little room for undoing coreferential thought\xE2\x80\x9D (64; see Forbes 1989 for some brief suggestions that provide for both), but it seems that the meta-representational demand imposed by her file-management model is too strong.</p>   \n\
  <p>Perhaps I have read too much into Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s model. She claims that we possess not just \xE2\x80\x9Ccapacities for reflective or meta-cognitive thought\xE2\x80\x9D but \xE2\x80\x9Cmany unreflective dispositions whose aim is the maintenance of correct information about individuals as individuals,\xE2\x80\x9D which are, she believes, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe place to look for the source of one\xE2\x80\x99s justification in taking mental terms to corefer\xE2\x80\x9D (22). Yet this very way of putting her point (\xE2\x80\x9Ctaking mental terms to corefer\xE2\x80\x9D) invokes the troubling meta-representational assumption. On the other hand, \xE2\x80\x9Cgrasping a sense again does involve a host of unreflective mechanisms\xE2\x80\x9D (22), in which \xE2\x80\x9Cwe must allow a certain degree of trust\xE2\x80\x9D (28). Her later (ch. 4) discussion of what these mechanisms do, and what they have to do in order for \xE2\x80\x9Ctrading on presumed coreference\xE2\x80\x9D to be warranted, does not really include an account of how they do what they do. Either these mechanisms do involve representations of one\xE2\x80\x99s representations (and their senses) or they do not. If they do, the problems mentioned above seem to arise. If they do not, then it is a mystery how they work. The only way out of this dilemma is to take a less internalist approach, one that does not require constant vigilance of the sort Lawlor demands. Then the capacity of warrant trading on presumed coreference would be built into our cognitive architecture and its natural workings, rather than on our vigilant control over it.</p>   \n\
  <p>This is a brilliant book in many ways. So I wonder whether my skepticism about people\xE2\x80\x99s ability to engage in meta-representational file management with the vigilance that Lawlor\xE2\x80\x99s account seems to require isn\xE2\x80\x99t the product of some meta-representational blindspot. If her account of the mechanics of coreferential thinking and the dispositions it involves does not make the meta-representational assumption that it seems to make, it needs to include an account of how these dispositions get realized otherwise. The present monograph is actually her dissertation, and one hopes that in future work she will integrate her account of thinking new thoughts about old things with a theory of singular thought itself and develop it with the help of relevant ideas in cognitive science.</p>     \n\
