content: "<p>This book is a brief history of German aesthetics from Baumgarten and Mendelssohn in the mid-eighteenth century to Heidegger, Gadamer, and Adorno in the mid-twentieth century--although, as the author notes, it should be called a history of Germanic aesthetics, since it includes S\xC3\xB8ren Kierkegaard, a Dane, Gy\xC3\xB6rgy Luk\xC3\xA1cs, a Hungarian who wrote in German, and Herbert Marcuse, who did the work discussed here in the U.S. (pp. x-xi). The author defends the restriction of his work to this tradition because, he claims, the \xE2\x80\x9CGerman aesthetic tradition is resistant to outside influences to an unusually high degree\xE2\x80\x9D -- a claim that I would deny in the case of all of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers he discusses, and for at least some of the twentieth-century ones -- and because \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophers outside this discourse respond to German concepts without themselves having a significant influence in shaping the tradition\xE2\x80\x9D (p. x) -- again, I think, a dubious claim in at least some cases.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Hammermeister states that he will organize his discussion of the individual figures around three issues: \xE2\x80\x9Cthe philosopher\xE2\x80\x99s ontological discussion of art, the...epistemic role attributed to art and beauty, and...the practical function the writer locates in artworks\xE2\x80\x9D (p. xiv). He fulfills this promise more in some cases than in others. The thesis of the work is \xE2\x80\x9Cthat paradigmatic positions in aesthetic philosophy were established during the period of German idealism and romanticism, that these paradigmatic positions were subsequently challenged by writers in the nineteenth century\xE2\x80\x9D -- though he has to twist himself into a pretzel to make Schopenhauer\xE2\x80\x99s challenge subsequent to Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s paradigm (pp. 111-12) -- \xE2\x80\x9Cand that in the twentieth century all the positions were renewed precisely in the order in which they first emerged\xE2\x80\x9D (p. xii). I found the author\xE2\x80\x99s discussions of the figures he treats less systematic than these two claims would suggest and did not always find a clear statement of the paradigms the authors in the period from Kant to Hegel were supposed to have established. His statement of the historical thesis of the work is particularly misleading because his discussion of Adorno, the last major figure from the twentieth century treated, aligns him with Schelling and describes him as emphatically rejecting the Hegelian view that art (or anything else) contributes to the emergence of an unified, integrative view of reality.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Hammermeister begins with a brief discussion of Baumgarten and Mendelssohn, maintaining that neither broke significantly from the framework of Leibniz and Wolff, although Baumgarten emphasized the cognitive value of perception and Mendelssohn recognized the value of the artistic expression of emotion in a way that his predecessors had not. I think this account underestimates the significance of Baumgarten\xE2\x80\x99s conversion of the Wolffian definition of pleasure as the \xE2\x80\x9Csensitive cognition of perfection\xE2\x80\x9D into the \xE2\x80\x9Cperfection of sensitive cognition,\xE2\x80\x9D which really makes Baumgarten\xE2\x80\x99s account of the potential pleasures in the use of our perceptual powers independent from the Leibnizian metaphysics of perfection; and I think he also underestimates the significance of Baumgarten\xE2\x80\x99s conception of aesthetic experience as \xE2\x80\x9Cclear but confused\xE2\x80\x9D -- or as some translate \xE2\x80\x9Cfused\xE2\x80\x9D -- perception, which had a tremendous influence on conceptions of the syntax of aesthetic objects from the \xE2\x80\x9Caesthetic ideas\xE2\x80\x9D of Kant through Hegel to Suzanne Langer and Nelson Goodman. I believe that Hammermeister also underestimates the power of Mendelssohn\xE2\x80\x99s complex model of the sources of pleasure in aesthetic experience. But the focus of Hammermeister\xE2\x80\x99s first chapter is on Kant. He presents Kant as \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivizing\xE2\x80\x9D aesthetics by focusing on the experience rather than the work of art, as advocating the \xE2\x80\x9Cautonomy of art,\xE2\x80\x9D and as being unable to reconnect aesthetics and morality once he has sundered them. As the contrast between the \xE2\x80\x9Csubjective\xE2\x80\x9D and the \xE2\x80\x9Cobjective\xE2\x80\x9D is a central theme of the work, with the progress of Schelling and Hegel over Kant and that of Heidegger and Gadamer over Ernst Cassirer being alleged to consist in the move from \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D to \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D conceptions of the aesthetic, I think that both the charge that Kant \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivized\xE2\x80\x9D aesthetics and the contrast itself need a far more careful examination than Hammermeister gives them; he seems to accept uncritically Gadamer\xE2\x80\x99s view that Kant is the source of this sin. His account also confuses Kant\xE2\x80\x99s conception of the autonomy of aesthetic <i>judgment</i> -- the idea that such judgment must be made entirely on the basis of one\xE2\x80\x99s own feeling even though it aims at intersubjective validity -- with the idea, a century later, of the autonomy of <i>art</i>. I don\xE2\x80\x99t believe that Kant ever entertained the later idea of \xE2\x80\x9Cart for art\xE2\x80\x99s sake\xE2\x80\x9D; rather, he confidently held that where art does not have moral significance it quickly becomes distasteful to us.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Hammermeister next presents Schiller as introducing a moral function for art -- holding out to us an ideal of a world that is better than the one we currently occupy but attainable -- which also allows \xE2\x80\x9Cthe beautiful to transcend the subjective sphere\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 55). He begins his chapter by stating that Schiller introduces an \xE2\x80\x9Canthropological and historical foundation\xE2\x80\x9D rather than \xE2\x80\x9Ctranscendental grounding of beauty\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 43), but ends up claiming that Schiller is unable \xE2\x80\x9Cto successfully fuse the historical and the formal aspect of his aesthetic theory\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 69). He then argues that Schelling develops a more successful account of how art allows the individual (subjective) consciousness to achieve identity with an absolute (objective) object, through the history of the development of art (which, as he notes, Schelling borrows wholesale from A.W. Schlegel), which represents \xE2\x80\x9Cthe harmony of conscious and unconscious activities\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 70). But Schelling\xE2\x80\x99s account (at least through the 1800 <i>System of Transcendental Idealism</i>) overemphasizes the significance of art as the only genuine \xE2\x80\x9Corganon\xE2\x80\x9D (as Schelling says) of truth, and it is up to Hegel to provide an account of the genuine cognitive and moral, objective significance of art, which however places art in a proper position of both historical and theoretical subservience to philosophy. Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s key insight, according to Hammermeister, is that while art is genuinely objective, it \xE2\x80\x9Ccan only retain its claim to truth if it is not considered as containing the truth of totality, but that of the multiplicity of the real\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 104). I do not think that Hammermeister recognizes how dependent Schelling\xE2\x80\x99s conception of art as bridging the unconscious and the conscious is on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s conception of genius, and thus how problematic the basic distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D conceptions of art really is; and while he recognizes that Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cdeath of art\xE2\x80\x9D thesis puts into question whether art actually has enduring objective significance on Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s account, I found his discussion of this threat (pp. 101-5) quite inconclusive.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In Part II, \xE2\x80\x9CChallenging the Paradigms,\xE2\x80\x9D Hammermeister discusses Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche. On his account, Schopenhauer reverts to a \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D standpoint even more extreme than Kant\xE2\x80\x99s, and with his emphasis on art as a tool for the individual alleviation of suffering gives up all effort to connect the aesthetic to a communal morality. Kierkegaard, with his radical distinction in <i>Either/Or</i> between \xE2\x80\x9Caesthetic\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cethical\xE2\x80\x9D attitudes, likewise gives up on any serious effort to connect the aesthetic and the ethical. Nietzsche, conversely, especially in his works of the 1880s, \xE2\x80\x9Caestheticizes\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy itself, although without providing precise definitions of his central categories of taste, beauty, and \xE2\x80\x9Caesthetics as physiology\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 149). Although Hammermeister does not make explicit any connections between Nietzsche on the one hand and the paradigms of Schelling and Hegel on the other, on his account Nietzsche could be seen as parodying Schelling\xE2\x80\x99s early claim for the superiority of art over philosophy and rejecting Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s position that art is essentially a stepping-stone on the way to philosophy. Instead, Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s cardinal sin is to reduce all philosophy to a matter of personal taste -- the ultimate in \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivism.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In Part III, \xE2\x80\x9CRenewing the Paradigms,\xE2\x80\x9D Hammermeister presents Cassirer as a neo-Kantian, Luk\xC3\xA1cs as a neo-Schillerian, and both Heidegger (with his disciple Gadamer) as well as Adorno as neo-Schellingians -- there is apparently no room for a revival of Hegel in the twentieth century. He criticizes Cassirer for reviving, in his own theory of symbolic forms, Kant\xE2\x80\x99s alleged separation of art from both science and morality, rather than allowing that Cassirer may also be exploring commonalities among these human enterprises by analyzing them all as forms of symbolic expression. Luk\xC3\xA1cs \xE2\x80\x9Cechoes\xE2\x80\x9D Schiller in seeing art as a \xE2\x80\x9Ctranshistorical aesthetic norm\xE2\x80\x9D for a better human life but makes no attempt to \xE2\x80\x9Cdeduce\xE2\x80\x9D this norm nor offers any clear way to \xE2\x80\x9Csquare this notion with a thoroughly materialist aesthetics\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 165). Heidegger \xE2\x80\x9Cinsists with Schelling on art as a <i>Wahrheitsgeschehen</i>...an occasion when truth becomes conspicuous,\xE2\x80\x9D and, while not insisting with Schelling that art offers \xE2\x80\x9Cthe <i>only</i> access to truth\xE2\x80\x9D, he nevertheless places it \xE2\x80\x9C<i>above</i> the propositional correctness of science, and, hence, some versions of philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 173). Hammermeister does not question Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s assumption that there <i>is</i> some deep \xE2\x80\x9Ctruth\xE2\x80\x9D about \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing\xE2\x80\x9D -- as opposed to many truths about many beings and our experiences of them -- for art to reveal, nor does he question Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s Luddite hostility to modern science and technology -- as if the solution to the ills of the twentieth (or twenty-first) century were to turn the calendar back to some premodern page rather than to learn how to use politics and diplomacy to control arms-races and instead put the potential of modern science and technology to work for the betterment of ever larger numbers of individual human beings. On the connection between art and morality, Hammermeister credits Heidegger with continuing \xE2\x80\x9Cthat idealist tradition that had always regarded art as a communal event\xE2\x80\x9D and seeing that art not only \xE2\x80\x9Cbreaks down the barriers between men\xE2\x80\x9D but is also \xE2\x80\x9Cone of man\xE2\x80\x99s primary activities on which all social life is based\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 184). Hammermeister treads remarkably lightly on Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s Nazism, claiming that there is nothing about Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s praise for the community-building function of art that \xE2\x80\x9Cmakes this concept specific for a National Socialist aesthetics,\xE2\x80\x9D but that \xE2\x80\x9Cnevertheless, the fact that Heidegger drops the political references in his writings on art in the in the 1950s and 1960s could be understood as a result of his disappointment with the National Socialists\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 185). Poor Heidegger -- disappointed by the \xE2\x80\x9CNational Socialists\xE2\x80\x9D! I have to say that the use of this term rather than the blunt \xE2\x80\x9CNazis,\xE2\x80\x9D thereby suggesting that the Nazis were just some sort of ordinary political party, makes me shudder. Following the discussion of Heidegger, Gadamer is given a few pages, in which he is described as taking \xE2\x80\x9Cup those interpretations of art that consider it as a form of play\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 190) and recognizing that \xE2\x80\x9Cart provides order in a disorderly, chaotic world\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 192). When Schiller (or for that matter Luk\xC3\xA1cs) characterize art as holding out to us an image of how a better world might be, that is apparently \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D and utopian; but when Gadamer says that art <i>does</i> provide order in a chaotic world, there is apparently no need for criticism.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Finally, Hammermeister\xE2\x80\x99s account of Adorno is fraught with tension. On the one hand, he claims that for Adorno, like Schelling but opposed to Kant, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot only does art offer cognition, but it also offers such cognition where the philosophical concept falls short\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 205). On the other hand, all that art can do with its alleged cognition is to keep alive \xE2\x80\x9Cthe hope for a better life in a better world\xE2\x80\x9D by saying \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99No\xE2\x80\x99 to the present\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 201), and \xE2\x80\x9Cart can only be political by completely refusing to participate in all matters social -- it must negate communication\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 207). Something has to give here -- although I am prepared to think that these tensions are Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s, not Hammermeister\xE2\x80\x99s -- for if art can offer some cognition, even only cognition that there must be some way in which the world could be better than it is now, then, one would think, it must have some way of communicating this cognition, while if art must negate communication, then one might think that it must also negate cognition. Of course, maybe there\xE2\x80\x99s some deep sense of \xE2\x80\x9Ccognition\xE2\x80\x9D independent of all possibility of communication that I\xE2\x80\x99m failing to understand here, just as I fail to understand some deep sense of \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing\xE2\x80\x9D independent of all particular beings.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Hammermeister clearly feels that there is something profoundly wrong with \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cahistorical\xE2\x80\x9D aesthetic theories and something profoundly right with \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Chistorical\xE2\x80\x9D theories. But he does not offer any general account of what the aims and tasks of aesthetic theory should be which would allow us to see why this must be so. And while he is explicit in his criticism of those whom he regards as \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivists,\xE2\x80\x9D he allows the most implausible claims of his \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivists\xE2\x80\x9D to pass without any critical examination at all. The historiography of the whole work, as I have already suggested, is very much based on Gadamer\xE2\x80\x99s view that Kant sent modern aesthetics down the wrong path by his \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivizing\xE2\x80\x9D emphasis on aesthetic experience rather than aesthetic objects. But Hammermeister never asks whether there is really anything we need to say about aesthetic objects that we can\xE2\x80\x99t say by talking about what is distinctive in our experience of such objects, including the social, political, and historical conditions and significance of such experience, or, conversely, whether there is anything we have to say about aesthetic experience that we can\xE2\x80\x99t say by talking about what is distinctive about the objects of such experience, including their social, political, and historical functions. In other words, Hammermeister never subjects to critical scrutiny the dichotomy on which his book is based. This is a serious limitation on the philosophical value of his work. The book provides brief introductions to the works of its subjects, which could certainly be of some use to new students of aesthetics if they are guided by well-seasoned teachers, but it does not attain the high level of the scholarship on the history of aesthetics that has been produced by philosophers in the last several decades, let alone advance that scholarship.</p>"

  <p>Hammermeister begins with a brief discussion of Baumgarten and Mendelssohn, maintaining that neither broke significantly from the framework of Leibniz and Wolff, although Baumgarten emphasized the cognitive value of perception and Mendelssohn recognized the value of the artistic expression of emotion in a way that his predecessors had not. I think this account underestimates the significance of Baumgarten\xE2\x80\x99s conversion of the Wolffian definition of pleasure as the \xE2\x80\x9Csensitive cognition of perfection\xE2\x80\x9D into the \xE2\x80\x9Cperfection of sensitive cognition,\xE2\x80\x9D which really makes Baumgarten\xE2\x80\x99s account of the potential pleasures in the use of our perceptual powers independent from the Leibnizian metaphysics of perfection; and I think he also underestimates the significance of Baumgarten\xE2\x80\x99s conception of aesthetic experience as \xE2\x80\x9Cclear but confused\xE2\x80\x9D -- or as some translate \xE2\x80\x9Cfused\xE2\x80\x9D -- perception, which had a tremendous influence on conceptions of the syntax of aesthetic objects from the \xE2\x80\x9Caesthetic ideas\xE2\x80\x9D of Kant through Hegel to Suzanne Langer and Nelson Goodman. I believe that Hammermeister also underestimates the power of Mendelssohn\xE2\x80\x99s complex model of the sources of pleasure in aesthetic experience. But the focus of Hammermeister\xE2\x80\x99s first chapter is on Kant. He presents Kant as \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivizing\xE2\x80\x9D aesthetics by focusing on the experience rather than the work of art, as advocating the \xE2\x80\x9Cautonomy of art,\xE2\x80\x9D and as being unable to reconnect aesthetics and morality once he has sundered them. As the contrast between the \xE2\x80\x9Csubjective\xE2\x80\x9D and the \xE2\x80\x9Cobjective\xE2\x80\x9D is a central theme of the work, with the progress of Schelling and Hegel over Kant and that of Heidegger and Gadamer over Ernst Cassirer being alleged to consist in the move from \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D to \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D conceptions of the aesthetic, I think that both the charge that Kant \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivized\xE2\x80\x9D aesthetics and the contrast itself need a far more careful examination than Hammermeister gives them; he seems to accept uncritically Gadamer\xE2\x80\x99s view that Kant is the source of this sin. His account also confuses Kant\xE2\x80\x99s conception of the autonomy of aesthetic <i>judgment</i> -- the idea that such judgment must be made entirely on the basis of one\xE2\x80\x99s own feeling even though it aims at intersubjective validity -- with the idea, a century later, of the autonomy of <i>art</i>. I don\xE2\x80\x99t believe that Kant ever entertained the later idea of \xE2\x80\x9Cart for art\xE2\x80\x99s sake\xE2\x80\x9D; rather, he confidently held that where art does not have moral significance it quickly becomes distasteful to us.</p>  \t\t \n\

Luk\xC3\xA1cs \xE2\x80\x9Cechoes\xE2\x80\x9D Schiller in seeing art as a \xE2\x80\x9Ctranshistorical aesthetic norm\xE2\x80\x9D for a better human life but makes no attempt to \xE2\x80\x9Cdeduce\xE2\x80\x9D this norm nor offers any clear way to \xE2\x80\x9Csquare this notion with a thoroughly materialist aesthetics\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 165). Heidegger \xE2\x80\x9Cinsists with Schelling on art as a <i>Wahrheitsgeschehen</i>...an occasion when truth becomes conspicuous,\xE2\x80\x9D and, while not insisting with Schelling that art offers \xE2\x80\x9Cthe <i>only</i> access to truth\xE2\x80\x9D, he nevertheless places it \xE2\x80\x9C<i>above</i> the propositional correctness of science, and, hence, some versions of philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 173). Hammermeister does not question Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s assumption that there <i>is</i> some deep \xE2\x80\x9Ctruth\xE2\x80\x9D about \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing\xE2\x80\x9D -- as opposed to many truths about many beings and our experiences of them -- for art to reveal, nor does he question Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s Luddite hostility to modern science and technology -- as if the solution to the ills of the twentieth (or twenty-first) century were to turn the calendar back to some premodern page rather than to learn how to use politics and diplomacy to control arms-races and instead put the potential of modern science and technology to work for the betterment of ever larger numbers of individual human beings. On the connection between art and morality, Hammermeister credits Heidegger with continuing \xE2\x80\x9Cthat idealist tradition that had always regarded art as a communal event\xE2\x80\x9D and seeing that art not only \xE2\x80\x9Cbreaks down the barriers between men\xE2\x80\x9D but is also \xE2\x80\x9Cone of man\xE2\x80\x99s primary activities on which all social life is based\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 184). Hammermeister treads remarkably lightly on Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s Nazism, claiming that there is nothing about Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s praise for the community-building function of art that \xE2\x80\x9Cmakes this concept specific for a National Socialist aesthetics,\xE2\x80\x9D but that \xE2\x80\x9Cnevertheless, the fact that Heidegger drops the political references in his writings on art in the in the 1950s and 1960s could be understood as a result of his disappointment with the National Socialists\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 185). Poor Heidegger -- disappointed by the \xE2\x80\x9CNational Socialists\xE2\x80\x9D! I have to say that the use of this term rather than the blunt \xE2\x80\x9CNazis,\xE2\x80\x9D thereby suggesting that the Nazis were just some sort of ordinary political party, makes me shudder. Following the discussion of Heidegger, Gadamer is given a few pages, in which he is described as taking \xE2\x80\x9Cup those interpretations of art that consider it as a form of play\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 190) and recognizing that \xE2\x80\x9Cart provides order in a disorderly, chaotic world\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 192). When Schiller (or for that matter Luk\xC3\xA1cs) characterize art as holding out to us an image of how a better world might be, that is apparently \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D and utopian; but when Gadamer says that art <i>does</i> provide order in a chaotic world, there is apparently no need for criticism.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Finally, Hammermeister\xE2\x80\x99s account of Adorno is fraught with tension. On the one hand, he claims that for Adorno, like Schelling but opposed to Kant, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot only does art offer cognition, but it also offers such cognition where the philosophical concept falls short\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 205). On the other hand, all that art can do with its alleged cognition is to keep alive \xE2\x80\x9Cthe hope for a better life in a better world\xE2\x80\x9D by saying \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99No\xE2\x80\x99 to the present\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 201), and \xE2\x80\x9Cart can only be political by completely refusing to participate in all matters social -- it must negate communication\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 207). Something has to give here -- although I am prepared to think that these tensions are Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s, not Hammermeister\xE2\x80\x99s -- for if art can offer some cognition, even only cognition that there must be some way in which the world could be better than it is now, then, one would think, it must have some way of communicating this cognition, while if art must negate communication, then one might think that it must also negate cognition. Of course, maybe there\xE2\x80\x99s some deep sense of \xE2\x80\x9Ccognition\xE2\x80\x9D independent of all possibility of communication that I\xE2\x80\x99m failing to understand here, just as I fail to understand some deep sense of \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing\xE2\x80\x9D independent of all particular beings.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Hammermeister clearly feels that there is something profoundly wrong with \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cahistorical\xE2\x80\x9D aesthetic theories and something profoundly right with \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivist\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Chistorical\xE2\x80\x9D theories. But he does not offer any general account of what the aims and tasks of aesthetic theory should be which would allow us to see why this must be so. And while he is explicit in his criticism of those whom he regards as \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivists,\xE2\x80\x9D he allows the most implausible claims of his \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivists\xE2\x80\x9D to pass without any critical examination at all. The historiography of the whole work, as I have already suggested, is very much based on Gadamer\xE2\x80\x99s view that Kant sent modern aesthetics down the wrong path by his \xE2\x80\x9Csubjectivizing\xE2\x80\x9D emphasis on aesthetic experience rather than aesthetic objects. But Hammermeister never asks whether there is really anything we need to say about aesthetic objects that we can\xE2\x80\x99t say by talking about what is distinctive in our experience of such objects, including the social, political, and historical conditions and significance of such experience, or, conversely, whether there is anything we have to say about aesthetic experience that we can\xE2\x80\x99t say by talking about what is distinctive about the objects of such experience, including their social, political, and historical functions. In other words, Hammermeister never subjects to critical scrutiny the dichotomy on which his book is based. This is a serious limitation on the philosophical value of his work. The book provides brief introductions to the works of its subjects, which could certainly be of some use to new students of aesthetics if they are guided by well-seasoned teachers, but it does not attain the high level of the scholarship on the history of aesthetics that has been produced by philosophers in the last several decades, let alone advance that scholarship.</p>"
