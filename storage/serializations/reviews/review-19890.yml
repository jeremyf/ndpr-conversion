The pure intuitionistic continuum of Brouwer is not constituted of a nondenumerable set of points, but more resembles the Aristotelian continuum as a site of potential points.

Aristotle and Descartes are seen as the founders of the atomized time, and Heidegger as the correct alternative. Along with the Cartesian atomization and arithmetization of time, the development of the mechanical clock and the machinery of the industrial revolution were producing an atomization of time that paralleled, fed, and reinforced the intellectual trend. Edward P. Thompson did a classic study of the role of the factory and clock in this change of consciousness.<sup><a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[5]</span></a></sup> Numerous studies from Lewis Mumford on have linked the rise of the clock and the disciplining and slicing of work and human life by ever more divided units of time. Anthropologists and anthropologically-influenced historians, such as the French <i>Annales</i></span><span style=\" color: black;\"> school, who, in turn, influenced the Marxism of Louis Althusser, have noted the role of different temporal rhythms and cycles in the account of history. These social analyses within Marxism, including Marcuse's, should have a greater role to play in a Marxist analysis of the alienation attendant on digital or discrete time than Eldred allows. Eldred approaches these issues as an ontologist and does not want to derive digitalization from economic and \"mere\" sociological influences.<sup><a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[6]</span></a></sup> However, one could claim that Heidegger's treatment of time in fundamental ontology is correct, but that the \"fallen\" modes of time-awareness and time description are a product of capitalism and social individualism.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\" color: black;\">Eldred ignores the whole postmodern claim that the predominance of information and communication has made Marxist analyses of production obsolescent. There certainly is the \"modes of information\" analysis of forms of media as replacing modes of production, and the claim that the rise of the service economy (ambiguous as the notion is) has replaced the productivist, manufacturing economy, at least in the developed countries. Eldred sidesteps this approach, but his own value-form approach also shifts the emphasis from Marx's productivist economics of manufacture to an emphasis on exchange and circulation more appropriate to the contemporary financialization of the economy.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\" color: black;\">Surprisingly, given his theme, topic, and mathematical comprehension, Eldred does not discuss Claude Shannon's information theory, which seems to fit seamlessly into the digitalization of being and the global network of communication. Alfred Borgmann, for instance, has made a very preliminary and dystopian stab at a Heideggerian account of information.<sup><a href=\"#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[7]</span></a></sup> Someone with Eldred's thorough knowledge of Heidegger, combined with the mathematical skills needed to investigate and characterize information theory at a much deeper level than does Borgmann, would be well placed to tackle a better Heideggerian critique of information theory.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\" color: black;\">Another topic that Eldred mentions in passing, the carry-over of the digital code notion to DNA genetics, could have been further developed (p. 72). There is a dispute among philosophers of molecular biology and genetics regarding how serious or how literally to take talk of \"genetic information\" in molecular biology. Some (Sahotra Sarkar, and Evelyn Fox Keller) have claimed that information talk serves merely as a sort of external ideological window dressing to molecular biology and does no real scientific work. Others (Maynard Smith, Peter Godfrey Smith) take talk of genetic information more literally. Whatever its worth, information talk has been reinforced by the growth of the field of bioinformatics out of computer scans of base sequences in the Human Genome Project and its congeners.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\" color: black;\">Eldred rejects strongly deterministic interpretations of Marx, not surprisingly, as do most \"Western Marxists\", but seems to do so even more completely, even in terms of the \"trends\" of vol. 3 of <i>Capital</i></span><span style=\" color: black;\">. Eldred's rejection of constraints of any sort moves him to a position closer to the early understanding of Sartre than to Heidegger. Furthermore, he rejects the labor theory of value and the Marxist theory of alienation. He plausibly says one does not need to accept Marx's human nature and value theory of alienation to accept that alienation exists in modern societies. After all, Kierkegaard, Heidegger and others have religion and \"human condition\" accounts of alienation. However, when one adds up all these rejections on the part of Eldred, one wonders whether he needs to incorporate Marx at all into his Heideggerian account. Other Heideggerian Marxists such as Herbert Marcuse<sup><a href=\"#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[8]</span></a></sup> </span><span style=\"\">attempt to integrate Heidegger's account of time with Marx's account of time in the labor process. Eldred's Marx is closer to those that emphasize \"the logic of capital\" than to the 'Heideggerian Marxism' of Marcuse or Andrew Feenberg.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Eldred, who did decades of productive scholarship and writing on the value-form interpretation of Marxism<sup><a href=\"#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[9]</span></a></sup>, seems in recent years to have divested himself of so many of Marx's theses that the retention of the Marxist apparatus may be a residue of habit. In his social ontology and other recent writings, he defends capitalism as not intrinsically unjust, so long as a level playing field for the conflict of entrepreneurs and between capital and labor is maintained. (He praises in the manner of Georges Sorel the struggle of powers between capital and labor. His appreciation of this opposition of powers sounds more Nietzschean than Marxist.) Eldred dismisses claims about injustice of grossly disparate economic rewards or the power of the capitalist to hire and fire workers as envy and resentment. Marx did consider capitalism to be just on its own terms, by holding an historically relative conception of justice. In more recent writings Eldred seems to believe that capitalism and freedom are intrinsically related, but more along the lines of Milton Friedman than those of Marx (both of whom link formal freedom with capitalism), insofar as Eldred rejects the notion of any solidarity superior to capitalist freedom.<sup><a href=\"#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[10]</span></a></sup> Eldred's emphasis on the money form rather than the concrete or even physiological notion of labor is valuable in that it makes Marxism better able to deal with the financial explosion and productive stagnation of recent decades. However, Eldred seems to have dropped most of that original Marxism with respect to critical evaluation of the market or envisaging<b> </b></span><span style=\"\">a society beyond possessive individualism.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The recent Eldred describes capitalism as the \"gainful game\" and wishes to contrast a totally indeterminate play with Marxist laws or even trends and with quantitative and predictive social science in general. However, it is well to remember that games of chance gave rise to the theory of probability contemporary with Descartes, and to twentieth century game theory.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\"><i>The Digital Cast of Being</i></span><span style=\"\"> is a very ambitious attempt to integrate fundamental ontology with a social ontology of the digital economy.

Eldred approaches these issues as an ontologist and does not want to derive digitalization from economic and \"mere\" sociological influences.<sup><a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[6]</span></a></sup> However, one could claim that Heidegger's treatment of time in fundamental ontology is correct, but that the \"fallen\" modes of time-awareness and time description are a product of capitalism and social individualism.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\" color: black;\">Eldred ignores the whole postmodern claim that the predominance of information and communication has made Marxist analyses of production obsolescent. There certainly is the \"modes of information\" analysis of forms of media as replacing modes of production, and the claim that the rise of the service economy (ambiguous as the notion is) has replaced the productivist, manufacturing economy, at least in the developed countries. Eldred sidesteps this approach, but his own value-form approach also shifts the emphasis from Marx's productivist economics of manufacture to an emphasis on exchange and circulation more appropriate to the contemporary financialization of the economy.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\" color: black;\">Surprisingly, given his theme, topic, and mathematical comprehension, Eldred does not discuss Claude Shannon's information theory, which seems to fit seamlessly into the digitalization of being and the global network of communication. Alfred Borgmann, for instance, has made a very preliminary and dystopian stab at a Heideggerian account of information.<sup><a href=\"#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[7]</span></a></sup> Someone with Eldred's thorough knowledge of Heidegger, combined with the mathematical skills needed to investigate and characterize information theory at a much deeper level than does Borgmann, would be well placed to tackle a better Heideggerian critique of information theory.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\" color: black;\">Another topic that Eldred mentions in passing, the carry-over of the digital code notion to DNA genetics, could have been further developed (p. 72). There is a dispute among philosophers of molecular biology and genetics regarding how serious or how literally to take talk of \"genetic information\" in molecular biology. Some (Sahotra Sarkar, and Evelyn Fox Keller) have claimed that information talk serves merely as a sort of external ideological window dressing to molecular biology and does no real scientific work. Others (Maynard Smith, Peter Godfrey Smith) take talk of genetic information more literally. Whatever its worth, information talk has been reinforced by the growth of the field of bioinformatics out of computer scans of base sequences in the Human Genome Project and its congeners.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\" color: black;\">Eldred rejects strongly deterministic interpretations of Marx, not surprisingly, as do most \"Western Marxists\", but seems to do so even more completely, even in terms of the \"trends\" of vol. 3 of <i>Capital</i></span><span style=\" color: black;\">. Eldred's rejection of constraints of any sort moves him to a position closer to the early understanding of Sartre than to Heidegger. Furthermore, he rejects the labor theory of value and the Marxist theory of alienation. He plausibly says one does not need to accept Marx's human nature and value theory of alienation to accept that alienation exists in modern societies. After all, Kierkegaard, Heidegger and others have religion and \"human condition\" accounts of alienation. However, when one adds up all these rejections on the part of Eldred, one wonders whether he needs to incorporate Marx at all into his Heideggerian account. Other Heideggerian Marxists such as Herbert Marcuse<sup><a href=\"#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[8]</span></a></sup> </span><span style=\"\">attempt to integrate Heidegger's account of time with Marx's account of time in the labor process. Eldred's Marx is closer to those that emphasize \"the logic of capital\" than to the 'Heideggerian Marxism' of Marcuse or Andrew Feenberg.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">Eldred, who did decades of productive scholarship and writing on the value-form interpretation of Marxism<sup><a href=\"#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[9]</span></a></sup>, seems in recent years to have divested himself of so many of Marx's theses that the retention of the Marxist apparatus may be a residue of habit. In his social ontology and other recent writings, he defends capitalism as not intrinsically unjust, so long as a level playing field for the conflict of entrepreneurs and between capital and labor is maintained. (He praises in the manner of Georges Sorel the struggle of powers between capital and labor. His appreciation of this opposition of powers sounds more Nietzschean than Marxist.) Eldred dismisses claims about injustice of grossly disparate economic rewards or the power of the capitalist to hire and fire workers as envy and resentment. Marx did consider capitalism to be just on its own terms, by holding an historically relative conception of justice. In more recent writings Eldred seems to believe that capitalism and freedom are intrinsically related, but more along the lines of Milton Friedman than those of Marx (both of whom link formal freedom with capitalism), insofar as Eldred rejects the notion of any solidarity superior to capitalist freedom.<sup><a href=\"#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\">[10]</span></a></sup> Eldred's emphasis on the money form rather than the concrete or even physiological notion of labor is valuable in that it makes Marxism better able to deal with the financial explosion and productive stagnation of recent decades. However, Eldred seems to have dropped most of that original Marxism with respect to critical evaluation of the market or envisaging<b> </b></span><span style=\"\">a society beyond possessive individualism.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\">The recent Eldred describes capitalism as the \"gainful game\" and wishes to contrast a totally indeterminate play with Marxist laws or even trends and with quantitative and predictive social science in general. However, it is well to remember that games of chance gave rise to the theory of probability contemporary with Descartes, and to twentieth century game theory.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\"><i>The Digital Cast of Being</i></span><span style=\"\"> is a very ambitious attempt to integrate fundamental ontology with a social ontology of the digital economy.
