content: "<p>I felt sure I would like Nomy Arpaly\xE2\x80\x99s book when I opened it to the first page and saw John LeCarr\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s name in the first sentence. I was not disappointed. Arpaly uses an engaging mix of literary examples and rigorous analysis to present and argue for a variety of interesting claims relating to virtue. Arpaly has something novel and interesting to say about autonomy, agency, moral worth, and virtue. This is an excellent book, and one of the best I\xE2\x80\x99ve read recently.</p>  \n\
  <p>Arpaly believes (and I agree) that moral theory has all too often been concerned with discussions of unreal agents; ones who are either positive or negative moral exemplars. Thus, the fuzzy middle cases tend to be avoided. Yet, she argues, these are the cases that have much to show us about moral worth in the real world.</p>  \n\
  <p>Let\xE2\x80\x99s consider first the LeCarr\xC3\xA9 example she uses, that of Oliver Single, who makes a momentous decision to side with the legal system and against his own father, and who makes this decision in a kind of mental haze. One can see that when it comes to momentous decisions, surely, people are often not the clear-headed rational paragons discussed in most of the philosophy literature. They are complicated, fuzzy, and while responsive to reasons not always clearly aware of the very reasons they seem to respond to in their actions. This sort of case is dear to my heart, since I have long held that virtue ethics in particular sets the bar way too high when it comes to criteria for moral virtue.<sup><a name=\"1b\" href=\"#1\">1</a></sup> Good people often don\xE2\x80\x99t have a clear understanding of their own motivations and the reasons that drive them. This is a theme that Arpaly deftly takes up in her own work, though she is focusing on the issue of autonomy and moral worth. Her account of moral worth offers, in one respect, an improvement over other accounts in the past \xE2\x80\x93 mainly focusing on virtue, again \xE2\x80\x93 which sought to account for similar sorts of cases. For example, in my account I try to argue that characters like Huckleberry Finn are virtuous, yes \xE2\x80\x93 and I give a consequentialist account of character traits to account for this. Arpaly, however, avoids the tangled debate over which account of moral evaluation is correct. Instead, she focuses on the more basic reason for why someone like Huck is praiseworthy: he is responsive to the right sort of moral reasons. And this is what counts, even though he cannot correctly represent those reasons as moral reasons, and he himself does not understand the nature of his actions. Her account is simple and elegant and captures the intuitive force behind the different cases without making contentious claims about the criteria for moral evaluation. Of course, that\xE2\x80\x99s not to say she doesn\xE2\x80\x99t make other contentious claims.</p>  \n\
  <p>Let\xE2\x80\x99s look at her claims about moral worth. Her main project is to come up with an account of \xE2\x80\x99praise\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x99blame\xE2\x80\x99 that is not autonomy based. One of the things she would like to do is give an account of why in some cases ignorance does not make one morally blameworthy, whereas in other cases it does. What is the relevant difference between the cases? On her view it is the quality of the will and the motivation. Is the person\xE2\x80\x99s heart in the right place, is she responsive to the right sorts of reasons, is her action \xE2\x80\x99authentic\xE2\x80\x99? If the person satisfies these criteria, she is praiseworthy. Consider again the case of Huckleberry Finn, a case well discussed in the virtue literature.<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> Huckleberry is na\xC3\xAFve and utterly mistaken about what is morally right \xE2\x80\x93 he helps a friend escape slavery, and actually feels guilty about it. Yet, in the end he does the right thing. The diagnosis of this case for Arpaly is that in spite of what he consciously believes, Huck is nevertheless responsive to the right sorts of reasons. I suspect that one reason we think well of Huckleberry Finn is that we do think that, transplanted to 21 <sup> st</sup> Century America, he would not have the ignorant views he in fact had. His basic will is a good one. This is not true of the inveterate racist, whose will is such that he is really simply looking for an excuse to hate. It is these sorts of thoughts that affect our intuitions in these cases. But I\xE2\x80\x99d like to add another one. We feel that, in light of these personality differences, one won\xE2\x80\x99t see someone like Huckleberry Finn hurting people, actually causing harm to others; whereas, in the other case, we don\xE2\x80\x99t feel nearly as confident. I think that Arpaly is neutral on this point, at least for now. She acknowledges that an account of what makes an action <i>right</i> is a gap in her account. But, as I noted earlier, this could also be viewed as an improvement, since her account makes the case for the goodness of these qualities \xE2\x80\x93 like Huck\xE2\x80\x99s brand of sympathy \xE2\x80\x93 which doesn\xE2\x80\x99t depend on a particular background theory. </p>  \n\
  <p>One of her targets in the later part of the book is the claim that agent-autonomy underlies normative-autonomy. Agent-autonomy is the \xE2\x80\x99self-control\xE2\x80\x99 sense of autonomy, and there are numerous ways to spell out this sense. However it is spelled out, though, it is distinct from normative-autonomy, which is <i>respect for</i> persons, or <i>respect for</i> their autonomy. Many hold the view that in order for normative-autonomy to be warranted, the agent must be exhibiting agent-autonomy. Arpaly critically discusses this claim, focusing on cases where it seems that we ought to respect a person\xE2\x80\x99s decisions (i.e. normative-autonomy) though that person does not seem to be fully agent-autonomous. Her aim is fairly modest; she simply wants to show that there is no <i>obvious</i> connection between the two.</p>  \n\
  <p>I guess that what I would want from the account is more sharpness and precision. To say that \xE2\x80\x9Cboth reason responsiveness and authenticity, if depth of concern is a substantial part of authenticity, are relevant to moral praiseworthiness and blameworthiness, and hence to moral responsibility\xE2\x80\x9D(131) doesn\xE2\x80\x99t do much to differentiate her account from what a lot of other different accounts would be committed to. \xE2\x80\x9CRelevant\xE2\x80\x9D covers a lot of territory, and her claims are driven more by cases than by theory. For example, I would very much agree with her on this, that \xE2\x80\x99responsiveness to reasons\xE2\x80\x99 is relevant, but then disagree with her take on some of the examples she uses. The agent, to even be an agent, needs to be responsive to reasons. It is responsiveness to the right sorts of reasons which contribute to praiseworthiness, but in the end what really matters is \xE2\x80\x93 what does the agent <i>do</i>, how does her behavior make a positive difference (or, more realistically, how could it reasonably be expected to make a positive difference)? Arpaly doesn\xE2\x80\x99t want to go in this direction, but on my view this is one other way to differentiate the Huck Finn\xE2\x80\x99s from the monsters who act horribly, though tormented by their own behavior. They are responsive to the right sorts of reasons <i>emotionally</i>, but it makes no difference to what they actually do. However, Arpaly doesn\xE2\x80\x99t want to commit herself in this direction. But this is basically a quibble. Arpaly has done an excellent job of generating an account of moral worth that is far more nuanced than most.</p>  \n\
  <p>There are gaps in the account, which she readily acknowledges, but these can and should be viewed as interesting issues for future exploration. Arpaly has written a book that is philosophically interesting and engaging. I encourage you to read it. You will not be disappointed.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
