content: "<p>The title of George Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s arresting <i>Breakdown of Will</i> is a <i>double</i> (at least) <i>entendre</i>. Most centrally, the title refers to those patterns of self-defeating behavior (akrasia, addictions, procrastination, compulsions, etc.) that Ainslie has stalked for many years. Just as important, though, the \xE2\x80\x9Cbreakdown\xE2\x80\x9D in <i>Breakdown of Will</i> refers to Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s own fascinating effort to break the will down, in the way one breaks down a mechanical device into its constituent parts in order to understand its construction and operation. The will, for Ainslie, is neither a mysterious organ nor an idle cog; it is a bargaining situation in which temporally distinct populations of partially cooperating interests compete for selection and, so, for survival. <i>Breakdown of Will</i> offers, <i>via</i> the investigation, diagnosis and explanation of various forms of irrationality and an account of the nature and the variable efficacy of self-control, nothing less than a genealogy of rational agency itself. In short, <i>Breakdown of Will</i> is heady stuff.</p>  \n\
  <p>Readers of Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s earlier, provocative, difficult, and massive <i>Picoeconomics: The Strategic Interaction of Successive Motivational States within the Person</i> (1992) will encounter much that is familiar here. Indeed, Ainslie notes in his Preface that he wrote <i>Breakdown of Will</i> as a result of his editor\xE2\x80\x99s invitation to summarize that earlier work. He writes that \xE2\x80\x9C[this] book is simpler, and, I think clearer. I have also added a great deal, both of research and theory . . .\xE2\x80\x9D (ix). There\xE2\x80\x99s no doubt that Ainslie is right about the fact that this is no mere summary of <i>Picoeconomics</i>. Moreover, the presentation here, though engaging, is less quirky, more direct, and more sharply focused than that of the earlier work. My sense is that readers are apt to find Ainslie\xE2\x80\x94who is a psychiatrist\xE2\x80\x94dealing here more straightforwardly with issues that squarely engage philosophical attention. This is not, however, to say that <i>Breakdown of Will</i> is an undemanding read.</p>  \n\
  <p>For Ainslie, the key to seeing our way through to his picoeconomic (or micro-microeconomic) perspective is to fix our attention squarely on the sort of behavior whereby human beings, all too frequently, destroy their own lives. Consider, for example, John Cheever\xE2\x80\x99s regard for his own alcoholism:</p>  <blockquote>Year after year I read in [my journals] that I am drinking too much . . . I waste more days, I suffer deep pangs of guilt, I wake up at three in the morning with the feelings of a temperance worker. Drink, its implements, environments, and effects all seem disgusting. And yet each noon I reach for the whiskey bottle. (1990, 54)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>Much of the early portion of the book is taken up with displaying how thin, by Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s lights, our understanding is of such irrational behavior. We haven\xE2\x80\x99t, according to Ainslie, really done much better than Plato\xE2\x80\x99s talk of a battle between reason and appetite\xE2\x80\x94reason is sometimes the victor, at other times appetite triumphs; but this intuitive picture produces no explanation of why one faculty is the winner in any particular contest. (Ainslie writes: \xE2\x80\x9CWhile science stands by, mystified, people keep wrecking their own lives\xE2\x80\x9D (28).)</p>  \n\
  <p>Cheever\xE2\x80\x99s problem isn\xE2\x80\x99t that he is subject to some form of visceral impulse fundamentally distinct from motivation in general. No, Cheever\xE2\x80\x99s problem is that he is subject to a reversal of preferences. (We\xE2\x80\x99ll see below that, according to Ainslie, Cheever suffers from another\xE2\x80\x94more serious\xE2\x80\x94problem: he\xE2\x80\x99s not very skilled at intertemporal bargaining.) This fact about Cheever is hardly an oddity, though. As Ainslie puts it: \xE2\x80\x9CPeople indeed maximize their prospective reward, but they discount their prospects using a different formula than the one that\xE2\x80\x99s obviously rational\xE2\x80\x9D (28). The traditional expected utility model presumes that my preferences are consistent. If Cheever prefers the smaller, earlier reward (whiskey), at a particular time (noon) to the larger, later reward (productivity in the evening, or quality time with his daughter), it is assumed that he will do so at every time. In short, the standard view is that actors\xE2\x80\x99 discount curves (the rate at which one discounts future goods) are exponential. (This is one reason standard utility theory would seem to have no use for the will.)</p>  \n\
  <p>But while Ainslie is a utility theorist, he is a heretical one, and throughout much of Part I of <i>Breakdown of Will</i>, he marshals an impressive body of evidence (animal studies, experiments with human subjects, as well as clinical observations, and neuroanatomical data) in support of the claim that our discount curve is not exponential but hyperbolic\xE2\x80\x94more deeply bowed than the exponential curve. Here is one picturesque illustration of hyperbolic discounting at play:</p>  <blockquote>If I ask a room full of people to imagine that they\xE2\x80\x99ve won a contest and can choose between a certified check for $100 that they can cash immediately and a postdated certified check for $200 that they can\xE2\x80\x99t cash for three years, more than half the people usually say that they would rather have the $100 now. If I then ask what about $100 in six years versus $200 in nine years, virtually everyone picks the $200. But this is the same choice seen at six years greater distance. (33)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>This is the \xE2\x80\x9Cwarp\xE2\x80\x9D in how we evaluate the future. Its presence is clearly visible in the case of someone like Cheever. In the early morning he prefers abstinence to intoxication, but then as noon approaches, he comes to prefer drink to the later larger reward, and then in the aftermath of his drinking (a choice that makes unavailable the later larger reward of, for example, an evening spent at work), he comes again to prefer abstinence, with, as he writes \xE2\x80\x9Cthe feelings of a temperance worker.\xE2\x80\x9D In the language of the fable of the ant and the grasshopper, we are all natural grasshoppers\xE2\x80\x94seduced by temporally nearer but smaller rewards. For Ainslie, then, the puzzle is not so much the explanation of irrational behavior, but rather the explanation of (what we\xE2\x80\x99re apt to regard as) rational behavior. Rational agency is an achievement\xE2\x80\x94a matter of getting ourselves to choose as if our discount curves were exponential. In sum, then, an akratic agent, such as Cheever, does, in fact, maximize expected reward; it\xE2\x80\x99s just that he discounts \xE2\x80\x9Cin highly bowed curves.\xE2\x80\x9D (There is a question here it, seems to me, as to whether this counts as an explanation of akrasia, rather than merely a representation of it.)</p>  \n\
  <p>This way of casting the problem sets the stage for Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s break down of the will in the second sense noted above. For, over time, someone like Cheever will come to view his own behavior as self-defeating. Indeed, he\xE2\x80\x99ll often make plans in the morning that he\xE2\x80\x99ll frustrate in the afternoon. If he is ever to satisfy his longer-term interests and secure the temporally more distant but objectively larger reward, he must, somehow, take into consideration that his goal of productivity in the evening is likely to become unpreferred through a certain temporal period during the afternoon. In short, the problem is how to \xE2\x80\x9Cget through\xE2\x80\x9D the period during which he prefers drink to abstinence. This, we\xE2\x80\x99ll see, is a matter of intertemporal bargaining between an individual\xE2\x80\x99s temporal distinct interests.</p>  \n\
  <p>Before turning to that issue, I want briefly to consider Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s appeal to hyperbolic discounting. The first, and, perhaps, obvious, thing to note, is that hyperbolic discounting describes a form of diachronic instability or inconsistency (Elster, 1999, 429). But this will come as a disappointment to those who regard akrasia, for example, as a problem of synchronic inconsistency or irrationality. That is, after all, meant to be a telling difference between the akrates and the intemperate or impulsive individual. The former, even while reaching for the bottle, holds or judges that there is another action open to him that is, all things told, better or more rational, or, indeed, preferable. The latter, on the other hand, is apt to think \xE2\x80\x9CWhat the heck\xE2\x80\x9D before reaching for the whiskey. I don\xE2\x80\x99t suggest that Ainslie doesn\xE2\x80\x99t have the resources to explain the <i>appearance</i> of synchronic inconsistency. (I suggest only that the phenomenon explained isn\xE2\x80\x99t the phenomenon many had in mind.) Indeed, there is a fascinating discussion in Chapter seven in which Ainslie argues that the akratic\xE2\x80\x99s belief that there is a better or more valued action available to her is just a bargaining ploy\xE2\x80\x94in this case, a failed one\xE2\x80\x94a \xE2\x80\x9Cpale\xE2\x80\x9D personal rule. (\xE2\x80\x9CPeople want,\xE2\x80\x9D Ainslie writes, \xE2\x80\x9Cto characterize value as something we <i>discern</i>, for the very reason\xE2\x80\x94my argument goes\xE2\x80\x94that framing the rule as a belief will make it more stable\xE2\x80\x9D (110).) Remarkably, then, our appeal to reasons is a kind of talisman, one that adds incentive in support of our longer-term interests. One is left\xE2\x80\x94I was left\xE2\x80\x94wishing for more about this important matter.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s appeal to hyperbolic discounting isn\xE2\x80\x99t limited to akrasia and addiction. Indeed, the experience of such preference reversals will differ according to how long they last. Some, \xE2\x80\x9Ccompulsions\xE2\x80\x9D (\xE2\x80\x9Cworkaholism\xE2\x80\x9D and miserliness), Ainslie terms them, may last years. Others, such as those distinctive of addictions, last hours or days. But, in other cases, the cycles of preference reversal may be very rapid indeed. As Ainslie argues in Chapter four, what we experience as deliberate behavior is only one species of reward-sensitive behavior. In this way, pains, itches, and emotions, like panic, may be conceived of as reward-dependent behaviors. (Hyperbolic discounting, the fact that we are subject to preference reversal, predicts, or at least makes space for, \xE2\x80\x9Ca split between <i>reward</i> and <i>pleasure</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (59). Strictly, for Ainslie, reward just is whatever it is that increases the probability of the occurrence of the behavior or process it follows.) These experiences (or at least most of them) aren\xE2\x80\x99t mandatory\xE2\x80\x94think of the ways in which we distract ourselves from pains or panic attacks (with mixed success). Something is seducing or luring us into the experience or behavior. But in certain cases, pain is certainly one, the lure is followed so rapidly by the non-reward, that there\xE2\x80\x99s no sense of our participation in the process. Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s discussion here is a <i>tour de force</i>. What Ainslie is offering us, then, is a unified theory of behavior, not one that must appeal to the mechanism of classical conditioning as a patch to deal with generally aversive behavior.</p>  \n\
  <p>The chief problem, as I noted above is how, given that I am subject to hyperbolic discounting, I am ever to satisfy my longer-range interests? Interests compete for reward, but the trouble for Cheever\xE2\x80\x99s interest in being productive in the evening is that the temporarily ascendant interest in drinking trumps it in the afternoon. But interests, at different points on time\xE2\x80\x99s arrow, can engage in tactics that render more likely their own satisfaction. Ainslie considers four such tactics: extrapsychic commitments, the manipulation of attention, the preparation of emotion, and, most important as it is the tactic that generates the experience of the will, personal rules. I\xE2\x80\x99ll briefly mention the first, and then turn to the last.</p>  \n\
  <p>The first is, of course, familiar from Jon Elster\xE2\x80\x99s (not to mention Homer\xE2\x80\x99s) discussion of Ulysses and the sirens. What\xE2\x80\x99s crucial to extrapsychic commitment is this: a longer-term interest (in the typical case) might, while it is dominant, make it impossible or at least more difficult to choose the temporarily preferred alternative; in addition, the dominant interest might somehow add to the incentive bearing on some future choice. If I\xE2\x80\x99m apt to be a spendthrift in a certain store, I might give my wife my wallet before the shopping-trip. Or, if I\xE2\x80\x99ve vowed to quit smoking on a certain day, I can tell everyone I know, adding public humiliation to the stakes at risk in the choice to smoke or not to smoke in future. These tactics don\xE2\x80\x99t require much conceptual sophistication. (Ainslie notes that pigeons display such self-binding behavior.) They\xE2\x80\x99re also not particularly flexible and invite certain predictable responses by competing interests: if I\xE2\x80\x99ve told everyone I\xE2\x80\x99m quitting cigarettes, I might find myself, when I prefer to smoke, taking long solitary drives to country to indulge.</p>  \n\
  <p>Hyperbolic discounting does, however give rise to another tactic, at least in conceptually sophisticated humans beings: personal rules\xE2\x80\x94a tool that, Ainslie argues, emerges from intertemporal bargaining and gives rise to what we describe as \xE2\x80\x9Cwillpower\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cthe will.\xE2\x80\x9D Indeed, given that it will become temporarily unpreferred, what enforces my resolve not to smoke or my intention to complete that overdue review? As we know, it seems to take effort. What explains this?</p>  \n\
  <p>In brief, Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s solution is to point out that I must come to choose in terms of categories or bunches of successive rewards rather than in terms of a single reward. Put it this way: even when Cheever reaches for the whiskey bottle (after all, at noon he prefers whiskey to productivity in the evening), it\xE2\x80\x99s likely that he prefers the prospect of a future series of abstentions to a future series of successive intoxications (cf. Bratman, 1999). Put another way, even while preferring drink now to work later, Cheever prefers a life of thoughtful productivity to a drunkard\xE2\x80\x99s life. As Ainslie notes, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe incentives for choosing between these two categories of rewards will be the summed expected values of the series of reward\xE2\x80\x9D (82). This works, Ainslie emphasizes, only if the shape of the discount curve is highly bowed, i.e., hyperbolic. So this manner of choosing\xE2\x80\x94categorically, in bunches\xE2\x80\x94is the basis of the personal rule. It is for Ainslie the source of the notion that we, sometimes at least, choose on principle. Of course, I\xE2\x80\x99ll be motivated to stick to principle, to my personal rule (for example, \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t have a drink before 9:00 p.m.\xE2\x80\x9D) only if there\xE2\x80\x99s a basis for thinking that I\xE2\x80\x99ll be consistently so motivated in the future. The basis of the choice is just this expectation. If I believe I\xE2\x80\x99m not going to succeed in getting the <i>series</i> of larger later rewards, I\xE2\x80\x99ll drink up, since I prefer drink <i>now</i> to productivity <i>now</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>As Ainslie is at pains to show (and as all our experience seconds), however, such a maneuver does not extinguish the lure of smaller, nearer rewards. The problem is not, according to Ainslie, how to explain the way in which such categorical choice \xE2\x80\x9Crecruits motivational support for long-range interests\xE2\x80\x9D (87). Human beings <i>can</i> look ahead to survey a future series of successive rewards\xE2\x80\x94and the summation effect, noted above, does the rest. The problem is that even as Cheever prefers the future series of abstentions to drinkings, what he <i>most</i> prefers (or, rather, what he most prefers at noon) is the future series of abstentions <i>and</i> drinking now. Here is Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s elegant formulation of the hard problem of the will: \xE2\x80\x9CActing in my long-range interest, how do I keep my short-range interest from repeatedly proposing an exception to my rule, \xE2\x80\x98just this once?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D (ibid.).</p>  \n\
  <p>Well, the short answer is that too many exceptions to the personal rule spoil the expectation that I\xE2\x80\x99ll succeed in getting the series of larger rewards. The will or willpower depends upon my regarding my current choices as precedents for my future choices. A <i>really</i> good excuse doesn\xE2\x80\x99t shake my expectation that I\xE2\x80\x99ll abstain in the future, since it isn\xE2\x80\x99t reasonably regarded by me as a precedent. But too many defections, in the language of the repeated prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s dilemma that Ainslie deploys, undoes my expectation that I\xE2\x80\x99ll succeed in securing the series of larger rewards. My motivation for cleaving to my principle is a matter of my saving the expectation that I will stick to it in the future. In this way, for Ainslie, self-control is a matter of reasonable self-prediction.</p>  \n\
  <p>Throughout Part II this picture is developed in compelling detail. (Chapter seven includes a wonderfully persuasive description of the ways in which the model predicts the properties traditionally attributed to the will.) If there\xE2\x80\x99s reason to worry about the effort to build the will and rational agency from such limited resources, I suspect Michael Bratman\xE2\x80\x99s (1999) worry in response to the earlier <i>Picoeconomics</i>, remains pressing. Too briefly, the worry is this: does my abstaining (or drinking) today give me a practical reason (on the basis of which I can make a rational choice) to abstain tomorrow? I will abstain now only if I can reasonably maintain my expectation of so acting in the future. If I drink now, I risk losing that series of larger rewards by virtue of the ways in which future selves will choose in the light of my current self\xE2\x80\x99s choice to drink. That is, I must now reasonably regard my current choice as a precedent for future choices\xE2\x80\x94a precedent that I can now reasonably take to make more likely my future selves\xE2\x80\x99 defection or cooperation. Again, it\xE2\x80\x99s a matter of aiming to maintain the expectation of future obedience to the personal rule <i>via</i> a current decision to choose in accord with the personal rule. Perhaps the thought is this: tomorrow, struggling with the same choice, I may think: \xE2\x80\x9CWell, yesterday I faced the same situation, the same considerations were relevant, etc., and I chose to abstain, so that\xE2\x80\x99s what I\xE2\x80\x99ll do today. What\xE2\x80\x99s more, in acting in this way today, I\xE2\x80\x99ll be in the same position tomorrow.\xE2\x80\x9D But this doesn\xE2\x80\x99t seem like deliberation; rather, I seem to be using choices or behavior as <i>evidence</i>, by appeal to which I predict what I\xE2\x80\x99m going to do. Ainslie is certainly right to emphasize that in making such choices what is fundamentally at stake is my credibility to myself (94), a kind of self-trust. After a certain number of lapses of the \xE2\x80\x9Cjust this once\xE2\x80\x9D variety, I\xE2\x80\x99m simply not going to take myself seriously. The question is whether the mechanism of intertemporal bargaining alone can provide a rational basis for the expectation that I will continue to choose to abstain. (See pp. 93-95 for what may well be an answer.)</p>  \n\
  <p>In this already too long review I haven\xE2\x80\x99t (sadly) considered Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of the ways in which the will is not an unmixed blessing. That discussion is masterful. Rule-based choice, Ainslie argues, will tend to generate compulsions and rigidity, will magnify lapses, generate self-deception, and undermine appetite. Ultimately, as Ainslie remarks, we\xE2\x80\x99re brought to \xE2\x80\x9Cthe heart of a central human paradox: that the better the will is at getting rewards, the less reward it will finally obtain\xE2\x80\x9D (175).</p>  \n\
  <p>The overall impression produced by <i>Breakdown of Will</i> is astonishment\xE2\x80\x94at its ambition, at the breadth and depth of learning on display, at the power and coherence and all-encompassing nature of Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s picoeconomic perspective. Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s immensely impressive achievement cannot be ignored.</p>    <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">References\r\n\

In the early morning he prefers abstinence to intoxication, but then as noon approaches, he comes to prefer drink to the later larger reward, and then in the aftermath of his drinking (a choice that makes unavailable the later larger reward of, for example, an evening spent at work), he comes again to prefer abstinence, with, as he writes \xE2\x80\x9Cthe feelings of a temperance worker.\xE2\x80\x9D In the language of the fable of the ant and the grasshopper, we are all natural grasshoppers\xE2\x80\x94seduced by temporally nearer but smaller rewards. For Ainslie, then, the puzzle is not so much the explanation of irrational behavior, but rather the explanation of (what we\xE2\x80\x99re apt to regard as) rational behavior. Rational agency is an achievement\xE2\x80\x94a matter of getting ourselves to choose as if our discount curves were exponential. In sum, then, an akratic agent, such as Cheever, does, in fact, maximize expected reward; it\xE2\x80\x99s just that he discounts \xE2\x80\x9Cin highly bowed curves.\xE2\x80\x9D (There is a question here it, seems to me, as to whether this counts as an explanation of akrasia, rather than merely a representation of it.)</p>  \n\
  <p>This way of casting the problem sets the stage for Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s break down of the will in the second sense noted above. For, over time, someone like Cheever will come to view his own behavior as self-defeating. Indeed, he\xE2\x80\x99ll often make plans in the morning that he\xE2\x80\x99ll frustrate in the afternoon. If he is ever to satisfy his longer-term interests and secure the temporally more distant but objectively larger reward, he must, somehow, take into consideration that his goal of productivity in the evening is likely to become unpreferred through a certain temporal period during the afternoon. In short, the problem is how to \xE2\x80\x9Cget through\xE2\x80\x9D the period during which he prefers drink to abstinence. This, we\xE2\x80\x99ll see, is a matter of intertemporal bargaining between an individual\xE2\x80\x99s temporal distinct interests.</p>  \n\
  <p>Before turning to that issue, I want briefly to consider Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s appeal to hyperbolic discounting. The first, and, perhaps, obvious, thing to note, is that hyperbolic discounting describes a form of diachronic instability or inconsistency (Elster, 1999, 429). But this will come as a disappointment to those who regard akrasia, for example, as a problem of synchronic inconsistency or irrationality. That is, after all, meant to be a telling difference between the akrates and the intemperate or impulsive individual. The former, even while reaching for the bottle, holds or judges that there is another action open to him that is, all things told, better or more rational, or, indeed, preferable. The latter, on the other hand, is apt to think \xE2\x80\x9CWhat the heck\xE2\x80\x9D before reaching for the whiskey. I don\xE2\x80\x99t suggest that Ainslie doesn\xE2\x80\x99t have the resources to explain the <i>appearance</i> of synchronic inconsistency. (I suggest only that the phenomenon explained isn\xE2\x80\x99t the phenomenon many had in mind.) Indeed, there is a fascinating discussion in Chapter seven in which Ainslie argues that the akratic\xE2\x80\x99s belief that there is a better or more valued action available to her is just a bargaining ploy\xE2\x80\x94in this case, a failed one\xE2\x80\x94a \xE2\x80\x9Cpale\xE2\x80\x9D personal rule. (\xE2\x80\x9CPeople want,\xE2\x80\x9D Ainslie writes, \xE2\x80\x9Cto characterize value as something we <i>discern</i>, for the very reason\xE2\x80\x94my argument goes\xE2\x80\x94that framing the rule as a belief will make it more stable\xE2\x80\x9D (110).) Remarkably, then, our appeal to reasons is a kind of talisman, one that adds incentive in support of our longer-term interests. One is left\xE2\x80\x94I was left\xE2\x80\x94wishing for more about this important matter.</p>  \n\
  <p>Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s appeal to hyperbolic discounting isn\xE2\x80\x99t limited to akrasia and addiction. Indeed, the experience of such preference reversals will differ according to how long they last. Some, \xE2\x80\x9Ccompulsions\xE2\x80\x9D (\xE2\x80\x9Cworkaholism\xE2\x80\x9D and miserliness), Ainslie terms them, may last years. Others, such as those distinctive of addictions, last hours or days. But, in other cases, the cycles of preference reversal may be very rapid indeed. As Ainslie argues in Chapter four, what we experience as deliberate behavior is only one species of reward-sensitive behavior. In this way, pains, itches, and emotions, like panic, may be conceived of as reward-dependent behaviors. (Hyperbolic discounting, the fact that we are subject to preference reversal, predicts, or at least makes space for, \xE2\x80\x9Ca split between <i>reward</i> and <i>pleasure</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (59). Strictly, for Ainslie, reward just is whatever it is that increases the probability of the occurrence of the behavior or process it follows.) These experiences (or at least most of them) aren\xE2\x80\x99t mandatory\xE2\x80\x94think of the ways in which we distract ourselves from pains or panic attacks (with mixed success). Something is seducing or luring us into the experience or behavior. But in certain cases, pain is certainly one, the lure is followed so rapidly by the non-reward, that there\xE2\x80\x99s no sense of our participation in the process. Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s discussion here is a <i>tour de force</i>. What Ainslie is offering us, then, is a unified theory of behavior, not one that must appeal to the mechanism of classical conditioning as a patch to deal with generally aversive behavior.</p>  \n\
  <p>The chief problem, as I noted above is how, given that I am subject to hyperbolic discounting, I am ever to satisfy my longer-range interests? Interests compete for reward, but the trouble for Cheever\xE2\x80\x99s interest in being productive in the evening is that the temporarily ascendant interest in drinking trumps it in the afternoon. But interests, at different points on time\xE2\x80\x99s arrow, can engage in tactics that render more likely their own satisfaction. Ainslie considers four such tactics: extrapsychic commitments, the manipulation of attention, the preparation of emotion, and, most important as it is the tactic that generates the experience of the will, personal rules. I\xE2\x80\x99ll briefly mention the first, and then turn to the last.</p>  \n\
  <p>The first is, of course, familiar from Jon Elster\xE2\x80\x99s (not to mention Homer\xE2\x80\x99s) discussion of Ulysses and the sirens. What\xE2\x80\x99s crucial to extrapsychic commitment is this: a longer-term interest (in the typical case) might, while it is dominant, make it impossible or at least more difficult to choose the temporarily preferred alternative; in addition, the dominant interest might somehow add to the incentive bearing on some future choice. If I\xE2\x80\x99m apt to be a spendthrift in a certain store, I might give my wife my wallet before the shopping-trip. Or, if I\xE2\x80\x99ve vowed to quit smoking on a certain day, I can tell everyone I know, adding public humiliation to the stakes at risk in the choice to smoke or not to smoke in future. These tactics don\xE2\x80\x99t require much conceptual sophistication. (Ainslie notes that pigeons display such self-binding behavior.) They\xE2\x80\x99re also not particularly flexible and invite certain predictable responses by competing interests: if I\xE2\x80\x99ve told everyone I\xE2\x80\x99m quitting cigarettes, I might find myself, when I prefer to smoke, taking long solitary drives to country to indulge.</p>  \n\
  <p>Hyperbolic discounting does, however give rise to another tactic, at least in conceptually sophisticated humans beings: personal rules\xE2\x80\x94a tool that, Ainslie argues, emerges from intertemporal bargaining and gives rise to what we describe as \xE2\x80\x9Cwillpower\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cthe will.\xE2\x80\x9D Indeed, given that it will become temporarily unpreferred, what enforces my resolve not to smoke or my intention to complete that overdue review? As we know, it seems to take effort. What explains this?</p>  \n\
  <p>In brief, Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s solution is to point out that I must come to choose in terms of categories or bunches of successive rewards rather than in terms of a single reward. Put it this way: even when Cheever reaches for the whiskey bottle (after all, at noon he prefers whiskey to productivity in the evening), it\xE2\x80\x99s likely that he prefers the prospect of a future series of abstentions to a future series of successive intoxications (cf. Bratman, 1999). Put another way, even while preferring drink now to work later, Cheever prefers a life of thoughtful productivity to a drunkard\xE2\x80\x99s life. As Ainslie notes, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe incentives for choosing between these two categories of rewards will be the summed expected values of the series of reward\xE2\x80\x9D (82). This works, Ainslie emphasizes, only if the shape of the discount curve is highly bowed, i.e., hyperbolic. So this manner of choosing\xE2\x80\x94categorically, in bunches\xE2\x80\x94is the basis of the personal rule. It is for Ainslie the source of the notion that we, sometimes at least, choose on principle. Of course, I\xE2\x80\x99ll be motivated to stick to principle, to my personal rule (for example, \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t have a drink before 9:00 p.m.\xE2\x80\x9D) only if there\xE2\x80\x99s a basis for thinking that I\xE2\x80\x99ll be consistently so motivated in the future. The basis of the choice is just this expectation. If I believe I\xE2\x80\x99m not going to succeed in getting the <i>series</i> of larger later rewards, I\xE2\x80\x99ll drink up, since I prefer drink <i>now</i> to productivity <i>now</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>As Ainslie is at pains to show (and as all our experience seconds), however, such a maneuver does not extinguish the lure of smaller, nearer rewards. The problem is not, according to Ainslie, how to explain the way in which such categorical choice \xE2\x80\x9Crecruits motivational support for long-range interests\xE2\x80\x9D (87). Human beings <i>can</i> look ahead to survey a future series of successive rewards\xE2\x80\x94and the summation effect, noted above, does the rest. The problem is that even as Cheever prefers the future series of abstentions to drinkings, what he <i>most</i> prefers (or, rather, what he most prefers at noon) is the future series of abstentions <i>and</i> drinking now. Here is Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s elegant formulation of the hard problem of the will: \xE2\x80\x9CActing in my long-range interest, how do I keep my short-range interest from repeatedly proposing an exception to my rule, \xE2\x80\x98just this once?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D (ibid.).</p>  \n\
  <p>Well, the short answer is that too many exceptions to the personal rule spoil the expectation that I\xE2\x80\x99ll succeed in getting the series of larger rewards. The will or willpower depends upon my regarding my current choices as precedents for my future choices. A <i>really</i> good excuse doesn\xE2\x80\x99t shake my expectation that I\xE2\x80\x99ll abstain in the future, since it isn\xE2\x80\x99t reasonably regarded by me as a precedent. But too many defections, in the language of the repeated prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s dilemma that Ainslie deploys, undoes my expectation that I\xE2\x80\x99ll succeed in securing the series of larger rewards. My motivation for cleaving to my principle is a matter of my saving the expectation that I will stick to it in the future. In this way, for Ainslie, self-control is a matter of reasonable self-prediction.</p>  \n\
  <p>Throughout Part II this picture is developed in compelling detail. (Chapter seven includes a wonderfully persuasive description of the ways in which the model predicts the properties traditionally attributed to the will.) If there\xE2\x80\x99s reason to worry about the effort to build the will and rational agency from such limited resources, I suspect Michael Bratman\xE2\x80\x99s (1999) worry in response to the earlier <i>Picoeconomics</i>, remains pressing. Too briefly, the worry is this: does my abstaining (or drinking) today give me a practical reason (on the basis of which I can make a rational choice) to abstain tomorrow? I will abstain now only if I can reasonably maintain my expectation of so acting in the future. If I drink now, I risk losing that series of larger rewards by virtue of the ways in which future selves will choose in the light of my current self\xE2\x80\x99s choice to drink. That is, I must now reasonably regard my current choice as a precedent for future choices\xE2\x80\x94a precedent that I can now reasonably take to make more likely my future selves\xE2\x80\x99 defection or cooperation. Again, it\xE2\x80\x99s a matter of aiming to maintain the expectation of future obedience to the personal rule <i>via</i> a current decision to choose in accord with the personal rule. Perhaps the thought is this: tomorrow, struggling with the same choice, I may think: \xE2\x80\x9CWell, yesterday I faced the same situation, the same considerations were relevant, etc., and I chose to abstain, so that\xE2\x80\x99s what I\xE2\x80\x99ll do today. What\xE2\x80\x99s more, in acting in this way today, I\xE2\x80\x99ll be in the same position tomorrow.\xE2\x80\x9D But this doesn\xE2\x80\x99t seem like deliberation; rather, I seem to be using choices or behavior as <i>evidence</i>, by appeal to which I predict what I\xE2\x80\x99m going to do. Ainslie is certainly right to emphasize that in making such choices what is fundamentally at stake is my credibility to myself (94), a kind of self-trust. After a certain number of lapses of the \xE2\x80\x9Cjust this once\xE2\x80\x9D variety, I\xE2\x80\x99m simply not going to take myself seriously. The question is whether the mechanism of intertemporal bargaining alone can provide a rational basis for the expectation that I will continue to choose to abstain. (See pp. 93-95 for what may well be an answer.)</p>  \n\
  <p>In this already too long review I haven\xE2\x80\x99t (sadly) considered Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of the ways in which the will is not an unmixed blessing. That discussion is masterful. Rule-based choice, Ainslie argues, will tend to generate compulsions and rigidity, will magnify lapses, generate self-deception, and undermine appetite. Ultimately, as Ainslie remarks, we\xE2\x80\x99re brought to \xE2\x80\x9Cthe heart of a central human paradox: that the better the will is at getting rewards, the less reward it will finally obtain\xE2\x80\x9D (175).</p>  \n\
  <p>The overall impression produced by <i>Breakdown of Will</i> is astonishment\xE2\x80\x94at its ambition, at the breadth and depth of learning on display, at the power and coherence and all-encompassing nature of Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s picoeconomic perspective. Ainslie\xE2\x80\x99s immensely impressive achievement cannot be ignored.</p>    <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">References\r\n\
