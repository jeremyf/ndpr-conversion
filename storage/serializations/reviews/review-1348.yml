content: "<p>There is a well-known tradition in the philosophy of mind and language that attempts to explain the representational properties of expressions in natural language as derivative from the representational properties of the mental states of their users. According to this tradition, words represent by being conventionally associated with concepts or mental representations. This picture of mind and language, often dubbed \xE2\x80\x9Cmental representationalism\xE2\x80\x9D, has a long and distinguished history, going back at least to Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s famous discussion in <i>De Interpretatione</i> and continuing even to the present. This traditional picture has increasingly come under attack, especially from philosophers influenced by the <i>Linguistic Turn</i>, a movement whose general methodological position reverses the priority of thought over language. Such philosophers reject the traditional \xE2\x80\x9CAristotelian\xE2\x80\x9D account of linguistic meaning and mental representation, placing language itself at the very foundation of traditional problems of philosophy.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>It is against this background that <i>Thomist Realism and the Linguistic Turn</i> must be understood. In this book John O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan presents and develops Thomas Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s account of mind and language with the specific aim of distancing one of Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s greatest followers from the so-called Aristotelian tradition of mind and language, and thereby showing that at least the <i>Thomistic</i>-Aristotelian tradition may be brought into fruitful dialogue with contemporary discussions influenced by the <i>Linguistic Turn</i>. As O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan himself describes his project, it has both a positive and a negative aim, namely, to \xE2\x80\x9Cmake some progress toward a better understanding of what the Thomistic-Aristotelian tradition does and does not claim about the relations that hold among words, thoughts, and things\xE2\x80\x9D (3). O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s discussion is rich and, in many ways, compelling. As we shall see, however, it succeeds more in accomplishing its negative aim (that of showing what Aquinas does not hold) than it does in accomplishing its positive aim (that of making clear what Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s positive views are).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The book can be divided into four parts. In the first part (chaps. 1-2), O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan considers Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s treatment of the famous <i>De Interpretatione</i> passage (16a3-8) in which Aristotle sets out his \xE2\x80\x9Csemantic triangle.\xE2\x80\x9D In this passage Aristotle claims that words signify thoughts, which in turn are likenesses of things. This passage is traditionally interpreted as providing the genesis of a semantic theory according to which words signify concepts primarily and things only secondarily (i.e., only <i>through</i> the mediation of such concepts).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan argues convincingly that Aquinas does not interpret Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s semantic triangle as identifying the <i>significata</i> of natural language expressions with concepts. On the contrary, Aquinas <i>simply takes for granted</i> (and assumes that Aristotle does as well) that words primarily signify extra-mental things. According to Aquinas, the only reason Aristotle mentions concepts in the <i>De Interpretatione</i> passage is to explain how <i>universal</i> expressions can signify things. Since, according to Aquinas, there are no universal <i>things</i> to be the <i>significata</i> for such expressions, their generality has to be accounted for in some other way. It is for this purpose, he says, that Aristotle introduces concepts as the \xE2\x80\x9C<i>modus significandi</i>\xE2\x80\x9D of universal words\xE2\x80\x94the manner in which they signify particulars. Thus, according to O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan, \xE2\x80\x9Cwere it not for the manner in which general words signify, intellect [and its concepts] would not play a part in the analysis of signification\xE2\x80\x9D (22).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>On the basis of all this, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan concludes that \xE2\x80\x9CSt. Thomas is not subject to the charge [of mental representationalism] at the level of his textual interpretation of Aristotle\xE2\x80\x9D (77). However, as he immediately goes on to point out, \xE2\x80\x9Csimply showing that St. Thomas is not subject to the charge at the level of his textual interpretation of Aristotle does not bring an end to the matter since his substantive philosophical discussion might still fall prey to it\xE2\x80\x9D (77). In the remainder of the book, therefore, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan goes on to argue that even in his more \xE2\x80\x9Csubstantive philosophical discussions\xE2\x80\x9D of mind, what is on offer in Aquinas is not any form of representationalism.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>As a way of setting the dialectical stage for his argument, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan provides, in the second part of the book (chs. 3-5) an overview of early modern and contemporary representationalist theories of mind together with a survey of the some of the most important criticisms lodged against such theories (especially by Hilary Putnam). This part includes: a brief survey of empiricist views about mind and language (specifically as found in Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), as well as early criticisms of these views by thinkers such as Reid, Husserl, Frege, and Wittgenstein (chap. 3); an outline of Jerry Fodor\xE2\x80\x99s attempt to revive the empiricist tradition via his account of mental representation and the Language of Thought (chap. 4); and a overview of Putnam\xE2\x80\x99s characterization and criticism of this broadly \xE2\x80\x9CAristotelian\xE2\x80\x9D tradition (chap. 5).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan uses the discussion in the second part of his book to draw out three \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophical assumptions\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Csubstantive theses\xE2\x80\x9D that he thinks lie at the heart of representationalism and the criticisms of it. He then argues in the third part of the book (chaps. 6-8) that Aquinas rejects each of these theses and hence escapes not only the criticisms that are associated with them, but also \xE2\x80\x9Cthe charge of representationalism\xE2\x80\x9D itself. The three theses and O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s reason for thinking Aquinas rejects them may be briefly summarized as follows:</p>  \t\t <blockquote> \t\t\t<i>Thesis I</i>: \xE2\x80\x9Cthere are things or objects in the mind that may be akin to pictures, appearances, effects, or some other mode of representation of things outside the mind\xE2\x80\x9D (155). O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan calls this the \xE2\x80\x9CThird Thing Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D and argues (in chap. 6) that Aquinas rejects it on the grounds that for Aquinas \xE2\x80\x9Ca <i>concept</i> is [nothing but] the informed activity of the intellect as it grasps <i>res extra animam</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (168). Thus, just as in grasping a pen in order to write \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is no third thing that exists between my hand and pen . . . [s]imilarly, there is no third thing other than the conceiving intellect and the <i>res extra animam</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (169-170).</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote> \t\t\t<i>Thesis II:</i> \xE2\x80\x9Cthe mind in its activity of thinking directs itself to these internal objects as what it primarily knows or attends to, or is related to\xE2\x80\x9D (156). O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan labels this the \xE2\x80\x9CIntrospectibility Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D and argues (in chap. 7) that Aquinas explicitly rejects something similar to it. What O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan has in mind is Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 contention that intelligible species are not <i>what</i> the intellect understands, but that <i>by which</i> it understands. Moreover, since that <i>by which</i> the intellect understands is not (except in cases of introspection) itself an object of cognition, it is not an object of consciousness.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote> \t\t\t<i>Thesis III:</i> \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is no intrinsic or necessary relation between the so-called \xE2\x80\x99mental representations\xE2\x80\x99 in the mind and the represented things outside it\xE2\x80\x9D (156). O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan calls this last thesis the \xE2\x80\x9CInternalist Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D. He attempts to show (in chap. 8) that Aquinas rejects it, arguing that since Aquinas holds (1) that in cognizing the intellect becomes formally (or structurally) identical to the things cognized and (2) that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe structure the intellect takes\xC3\x82\xE2\x80\xA6is a result of the particular way in which the human person interacts causally with its environment,\xE2\x80\x9D (249) he must be conceived as an externalist about mental content.</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In the fourth and final part of the book (chap. 9), O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan briefly discusses what Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s views have to contribute to contemporary discussions influenced by linguistically-turned philosophers such as Putnam and McDowell. According to O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan, what Aquinas offers us is an account of language not typically recognized by philosophers such as Putnam\xE2\x80\x94namely, an account that connects meaning with the mind, but not with <i>mental representations</i> or <i>mental \xE2\x80\x9Csymbols</i>\xE2\x80\x9D. Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s theory doesn\xE2\x80\x99t render language and knowledge internal, private, or \xE2\x80\x9Coverly-individualistic\xE2\x80\x9D, but is rather more like McDowell\xE2\x80\x99s in its attempt to \xE2\x80\x9Celiminate the dualism of the internal and external in our philosophical reflection upon knowledge\xE2\x80\x9D (279). Indeed, according to O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan, Aquinas is more successful at this than is McDowell, since for Aquinas, language and knowledge do not constitute a <i>sui-generis</i> form of life \xE2\x80\x9Cuntethered from the characteristically animal modes of human life, or at best with nothing more than a \xE2\x80\x99foothold\xE2\x80\x99 in them\xE2\x80\x9D (285). On the Thomistic picture these aspects of human nature are really just \xE2\x80\x9Ca more perfect form of natural existence\xE2\x80\x9D (297). It is this picture of the continuity of language and knowledge with more basic forms of human life that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan sees as the most significant contribution emerging from the <i>Thomistic</i>-Aristotelian tradition.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s book is well worth reading. His project is both ambitious and interesting and the way in which he develops it highlights that, while Aquinas may be one of the more well-studied figures among medieval philosophers, we still have much to learn from (and about) his work. O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan situates Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 theory of mind and language vis-\xC3\xA0-vis contemporary dialectical debates in a way that is useful and, in doing so, succeeds in showing that Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of mind and language is more sophisticated, and has more in common with contemporary discussions than one might expect. When it comes to the explaining of <i>the</i> \t\t\t<i>details</i> of Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 theory of mind and language, however, I think it must be said that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s discussion is much less satisfying. This fact, I shall suggest, may owe partly to the overall dialectical strategy that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan pursues, and partly to the audience for whom he\xE2\x80\x99s writing.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>As should be clear from the foregoing overview, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s project has a largely negative aim. Although he does make an effort to characterize Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s positive views about mind and language, as well as to indicate their potential for advancing certain contemporary debates, his main goal is to establish what views Aquinas does <i>not</i> hold. Thus, he devotes the lion\xE2\x80\x99s share of the book to showing that Aquinas is <i>not</i> committed to three theses associated with mental representationalism, and therefore that, ultimately, Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 account does not fit within the Aristotelian\xE2\x80\x94or mental representationalist\xE2\x80\x94tradition.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>With regard to Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s rejection of the first two representationalist theses, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s arguments are, for the most part, compelling. The case he makes for Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s rejection of the \xE2\x80\x9CInternalist Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D is, however, less convincing. Recall that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s case rests on attributing to Aquinas two claims: (1) concepts and things conceived by them are formally identical and (2) what concepts we possess depends on our causal interactions with the world. But it\xE2\x80\x99s not clear that Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s commitment to these two claims is, by itself, sufficient to establish his rejection of the \xE2\x80\x9CInternalist Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D. Although the formal identity of concepts and their objects establishes, in some sense, an \xE2\x80\x9Cintrinsic\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cnecessary\xE2\x80\x9D relation between them, this isn\xE2\x80\x99t, as O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan acknowledges, sufficient to show that Aquinas rejects internalism. But adding the second claim doesn\xE2\x80\x99t seem to help. For even if (2) is true, all that follows is that concepts are <i>causally dependent</i> on their objects, <i>not logically</i> or <i>metaphysically dependent</i>. But the strong claim is what must be shown to establish that Aquinas is an externalist about mental content.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Even setting aside any worries about Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s relation to the three theses, important questions still remain. For, <i>even if</i> O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan is right and Aquinas is not committed to <i>any</i> of these theses, it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t obviously follow that Aquinas isn\xE2\x80\x99t, nevertheless, committed to <i>some</i> version of mental representationalism. In order to establish that Aquinas doesn\xE2\x80\x99t hold any form of mental representationalism, much more is required\xE2\x80\x94in particular, a more careful and a more detailed analysis of Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s positive views about mind and language. To the extent that one approaches this book expecting this kind of detailed positive analysis, one can\xE2\x80\x99t help but be a bit disappointed.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>There are at least two reasons for this. First, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan does very little to clarify crucial (and often technical) notions in Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 theory of mind. In the case of some technical notions, such as, for example, agent and possible intellect, he leaves them entirely unexplained, whereas in the case of others, e.g., abstraction, concepts, and formal identity, his discussion is either vague or merely suggestive. Second, to the extent that he does attempt to clarify these notions, the strategy he pursues is largely negative. For example, when O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan takes up Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 notion of abstraction, he begins with the following vague but suggestive description: abstraction is \xE2\x80\x9Ca progress from a general and confused act based on sense experience to a more specific and precise act\xE2\x80\x9D (222) and, thus, ultimately a kind of \xE2\x80\x9Cdevelopmental view of concept use\xE2\x80\x9D (252). Then, all he offers us by way of clarification is an account of how <i>not</i> to understand this abstraction process: it\xE2\x80\x99s <i>not</i> a process of \xE2\x80\x9Cmoving forms from place to place\xE2\x80\x9D, of \xE2\x80\x9Cillumination\xE2\x80\x9D or of \xE2\x80\x9Cselectively attending\xE2\x80\x9D or of \xE2\x80\x9Cselectively ignoring\xE2\x80\x9D. The case is much the same when it comes to O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of concepts. For Aquinas, he says, concepts are \xE2\x80\x9Cthe informed activity of the intellect as it grasps the <i>res extra animam</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (168). But isn\xE2\x80\x99t this characterization compatible with a number of more substantive views about the nature of concepts? While O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan states at various points what he thinks the substantive account is <i>not</i> (e.g. concepts thus construed are not \xE2\x80\x9Can inner language\xE2\x80\x9D, not \xE2\x80\x9Crepresentations\xE2\x80\x9D or mental \xE2\x80\x9Csymbols\xE2\x80\x9D nor are they \xE2\x80\x9Ccapacities to use linguistic signs\xE2\x80\x9D) he says little more about what it is. O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s tendency to rely on a kind of <i>via negativa</i> approach or to leave certain technical notions altogether unexplained is unfortunate. For it not only undermines, at crucial points, his attempt to communicate in an informative way what Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s theory of mind actually is; it also makes the volume as a whole less useful than it otherwise might have been.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>To be fair, it must be said that what I am describing as shortcomings may be a function of the audience for whom O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan intends the book. There are several indications that this text is intended, not as introduction to Aquinas for contemporary philosophers of language and mind, but rather as an introduction for Thomists (or people already familiar with Aquinas) to those aspects of discussions in contemporary philosophy of mind relevant for situating Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s views with respect to them. There is, for example, the fact that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan spends three chapters introducing and explaining basic developments in early modern and contemporary discussions in philosophy of mind and language, while often passing over important (and, for most, very foreign) aspects of Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysics, psychology, and semantics. All of this makes sense if O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan is assuming an audience well acquainted with Aquinas but less familiar with contemporary philosophy. For such an audience a full presentation of the details of Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 view may not be necessary; for such an audience it may be enough simply to rule out various alternative readings in order for O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan to locate his own interpretation.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Insofar as no text can be suited for every audience, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s approach is, of course, perfectly acceptable. Nonetheless, I suspect that those still struggling to understand Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s thought will be disappointed that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan hasn\xE2\x80\x99t done more to open it up for us\xE2\x80\x94especially since, given his conversancy with the contemporary literature, he is in such a good position to do so. Even so, this book will be useful for anyone wanting either an introduction to some important issues in contemporary philosophy of mind and language (e.g. the summary of Fodor\xE2\x80\x99s views in chap. 4 is quite good) or some broad direction in thinking about how Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s thought relates to them.<sup><a name=\"1b\" href=\"#1\">1</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

[s]imilarly, there is no third thing other than the conceiving intellect and the <i>res extra animam</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (169-170).</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote> \t\t\t<i>Thesis II:</i> \xE2\x80\x9Cthe mind in its activity of thinking directs itself to these internal objects as what it primarily knows or attends to, or is related to\xE2\x80\x9D (156). O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan labels this the \xE2\x80\x9CIntrospectibility Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D and argues (in chap. 7) that Aquinas explicitly rejects something similar to it. What O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan has in mind is Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 contention that intelligible species are not <i>what</i> the intellect understands, but that <i>by which</i> it understands. Moreover, since that <i>by which</i> the intellect understands is not (except in cases of introspection) itself an object of cognition, it is not an object of consciousness.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote> \t\t\t<i>Thesis III:</i> \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is no intrinsic or necessary relation between the so-called \xE2\x80\x99mental representations\xE2\x80\x99 in the mind and the represented things outside it\xE2\x80\x9D (156). O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan calls this last thesis the \xE2\x80\x9CInternalist Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D. He attempts to show (in chap. 8) that Aquinas rejects it, arguing that since Aquinas holds (1) that in cognizing the intellect becomes formally (or structurally) identical to the things cognized and (2) that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe structure the intellect takes\xC3\x82\xE2\x80\xA6is a result of the particular way in which the human person interacts causally with its environment,\xE2\x80\x9D (249) he must be conceived as an externalist about mental content.</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In the fourth and final part of the book (chap. 9), O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan briefly discusses what Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s views have to contribute to contemporary discussions influenced by linguistically-turned philosophers such as Putnam and McDowell. According to O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan, what Aquinas offers us is an account of language not typically recognized by philosophers such as Putnam\xE2\x80\x94namely, an account that connects meaning with the mind, but not with <i>mental representations</i> or <i>mental \xE2\x80\x9Csymbols</i>\xE2\x80\x9D. Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s theory doesn\xE2\x80\x99t render language and knowledge internal, private, or \xE2\x80\x9Coverly-individualistic\xE2\x80\x9D, but is rather more like McDowell\xE2\x80\x99s in its attempt to \xE2\x80\x9Celiminate the dualism of the internal and external in our philosophical reflection upon knowledge\xE2\x80\x9D (279). Indeed, according to O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan, Aquinas is more successful at this than is McDowell, since for Aquinas, language and knowledge do not constitute a <i>sui-generis</i> form of life \xE2\x80\x9Cuntethered from the characteristically animal modes of human life, or at best with nothing more than a \xE2\x80\x99foothold\xE2\x80\x99 in them\xE2\x80\x9D (285). On the Thomistic picture these aspects of human nature are really just \xE2\x80\x9Ca more perfect form of natural existence\xE2\x80\x9D (297). It is this picture of the continuity of language and knowledge with more basic forms of human life that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan sees as the most significant contribution emerging from the <i>Thomistic</i>-Aristotelian tradition.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s book is well worth reading. His project is both ambitious and interesting and the way in which he develops it highlights that, while Aquinas may be one of the more well-studied figures among medieval philosophers, we still have much to learn from (and about) his work. O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan situates Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 theory of mind and language vis-\xC3\xA0-vis contemporary dialectical debates in a way that is useful and, in doing so, succeeds in showing that Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of mind and language is more sophisticated, and has more in common with contemporary discussions than one might expect. When it comes to the explaining of <i>the</i> \t\t\t<i>details</i> of Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 theory of mind and language, however, I think it must be said that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s discussion is much less satisfying. This fact, I shall suggest, may owe partly to the overall dialectical strategy that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan pursues, and partly to the audience for whom he\xE2\x80\x99s writing.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>As should be clear from the foregoing overview, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s project has a largely negative aim. Although he does make an effort to characterize Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s positive views about mind and language, as well as to indicate their potential for advancing certain contemporary debates, his main goal is to establish what views Aquinas does <i>not</i> hold. Thus, he devotes the lion\xE2\x80\x99s share of the book to showing that Aquinas is <i>not</i> committed to three theses associated with mental representationalism, and therefore that, ultimately, Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 account does not fit within the Aristotelian\xE2\x80\x94or mental representationalist\xE2\x80\x94tradition.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>With regard to Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s rejection of the first two representationalist theses, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s arguments are, for the most part, compelling. The case he makes for Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s rejection of the \xE2\x80\x9CInternalist Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D is, however, less convincing. Recall that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s case rests on attributing to Aquinas two claims: (1) concepts and things conceived by them are formally identical and (2) what concepts we possess depends on our causal interactions with the world. But it\xE2\x80\x99s not clear that Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s commitment to these two claims is, by itself, sufficient to establish his rejection of the \xE2\x80\x9CInternalist Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D. Although the formal identity of concepts and their objects establishes, in some sense, an \xE2\x80\x9Cintrinsic\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cnecessary\xE2\x80\x9D relation between them, this isn\xE2\x80\x99t, as O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan acknowledges, sufficient to show that Aquinas rejects internalism. But adding the second claim doesn\xE2\x80\x99t seem to help. For even if (2) is true, all that follows is that concepts are <i>causally dependent</i> on their objects, <i>not logically</i> or <i>metaphysically dependent</i>. But the strong claim is what must be shown to establish that Aquinas is an externalist about mental content.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Even setting aside any worries about Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s relation to the three theses, important questions still remain. For, <i>even if</i> O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan is right and Aquinas is not committed to <i>any</i> of these theses, it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t obviously follow that Aquinas isn\xE2\x80\x99t, nevertheless, committed to <i>some</i> version of mental representationalism. In order to establish that Aquinas doesn\xE2\x80\x99t hold any form of mental representationalism, much more is required\xE2\x80\x94in particular, a more careful and a more detailed analysis of Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s positive views about mind and language. To the extent that one approaches this book expecting this kind of detailed positive analysis, one can\xE2\x80\x99t help but be a bit disappointed.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>There are at least two reasons for this. First, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan does very little to clarify crucial (and often technical) notions in Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 theory of mind. In the case of some technical notions, such as, for example, agent and possible intellect, he leaves them entirely unexplained, whereas in the case of others, e.g., abstraction, concepts, and formal identity, his discussion is either vague or merely suggestive. Second, to the extent that he does attempt to clarify these notions, the strategy he pursues is largely negative. For example, when O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan takes up Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 notion of abstraction, he begins with the following vague but suggestive description: abstraction is \xE2\x80\x9Ca progress from a general and confused act based on sense experience to a more specific and precise act\xE2\x80\x9D (222) and, thus, ultimately a kind of \xE2\x80\x9Cdevelopmental view of concept use\xE2\x80\x9D (252). Then, all he offers us by way of clarification is an account of how <i>not</i> to understand this abstraction process: it\xE2\x80\x99s <i>not</i> a process of \xE2\x80\x9Cmoving forms from place to place\xE2\x80\x9D, of \xE2\x80\x9Cillumination\xE2\x80\x9D or of \xE2\x80\x9Cselectively attending\xE2\x80\x9D or of \xE2\x80\x9Cselectively ignoring\xE2\x80\x9D. The case is much the same when it comes to O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of concepts. For Aquinas, he says, concepts are \xE2\x80\x9Cthe informed activity of the intellect as it grasps the <i>res extra animam</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (168). But isn\xE2\x80\x99t this characterization compatible with a number of more substantive views about the nature of concepts? While O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan states at various points what he thinks the substantive account is <i>not</i> (e.g. concepts thus construed are not \xE2\x80\x9Can inner language\xE2\x80\x9D, not \xE2\x80\x9Crepresentations\xE2\x80\x9D or mental \xE2\x80\x9Csymbols\xE2\x80\x9D nor are they \xE2\x80\x9Ccapacities to use linguistic signs\xE2\x80\x9D) he says little more about what it is. O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s tendency to rely on a kind of <i>via negativa</i> approach or to leave certain technical notions altogether unexplained is unfortunate. For it not only undermines, at crucial points, his attempt to communicate in an informative way what Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s theory of mind actually is; it also makes the volume as a whole less useful than it otherwise might have been.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>To be fair, it must be said that what I am describing as shortcomings may be a function of the audience for whom O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan intends the book. There are several indications that this text is intended, not as introduction to Aquinas for contemporary philosophers of language and mind, but rather as an introduction for Thomists (or people already familiar with Aquinas) to those aspects of discussions in contemporary philosophy of mind relevant for situating Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s views with respect to them. There is, for example, the fact that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan spends three chapters introducing and explaining basic developments in early modern and contemporary discussions in philosophy of mind and language, while often passing over important (and, for most, very foreign) aspects of Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysics, psychology, and semantics. All of this makes sense if O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan is assuming an audience well acquainted with Aquinas but less familiar with contemporary philosophy. For such an audience a full presentation of the details of Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99 view may not be necessary; for such an audience it may be enough simply to rule out various alternative readings in order for O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan to locate his own interpretation.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Insofar as no text can be suited for every audience, O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan\xE2\x80\x99s approach is, of course, perfectly acceptable. Nonetheless, I suspect that those still struggling to understand Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s thought will be disappointed that O\xE2\x80\x99Callaghan hasn\xE2\x80\x99t done more to open it up for us\xE2\x80\x94especially since, given his conversancy with the contemporary literature, he is in such a good position to do so. Even so, this book will be useful for anyone wanting either an introduction to some important issues in contemporary philosophy of mind and language (e.g. the summary of Fodor\xE2\x80\x99s views in chap. 4 is quite good) or some broad direction in thinking about how Aquinas\xE2\x80\x99s thought relates to them.<sup><a name=\"1b\" href=\"#1\">1</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
