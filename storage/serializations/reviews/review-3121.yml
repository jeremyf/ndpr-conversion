  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Dennis Thompson tells the story of the director of a super market chain who, at a business ethics conference for corporate leaders, emphasized the need to teach customers ethical behavior so they would not steal grocery carts for use at home.<span style="">  </span>The executive, Thompson believes, mistakenly placed undue emphasis on a problem of individual ethics, rather than focusing on more important questions concerning institutional ethics.<span style="">  </span>Institutional ethics concerns "the relations of individuals as members of organizations and as citizens" (300).<span style="">  </span>For the last twenty-five years Thompson has been arguing that applied ethicists should focus their attention on problems related to institutional responsibility rather than mere individual responsibility.<span style="">  </span>This book is a collection of sixteen essays written in that period, two-thirds of which have as their subject governmental institutions.<span style="">  </span>The main theme of the essays is that institutions in democratic societies will better serve the public if they operate in accordance with democratically determined ethical principles.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The title of this book is somewhat misleading in that the author is not concerned with "restoring responsibility" that has disappeared from once honorable public institutions.<span style="">  </span>Indeed, he believes that such institutions are less vicious than in the past.<span style="">  </span>His aim is instead to defend a more robust conception of responsibility for social and political institutions.<span style="">  </span>The account of responsibility that emerges includes a number of distinctive features.<span style="">  </span>First, it is democratic in that it regards individual agents within institutions as responsible for institutional failings.<span style="">  </span>One might suppose that an applied ethicist who was interested in turning attention away from individuals and toward institutions would place the locus of responsibility for wrongdoing upon the institution itself rather than individual members of the institutions. Instead, Thompson argues that in democratic societies, individuals are ultimately accountable for their institutions.<span style="">  </span>Major responsibility lies with the designers of the institutions, but even low-level bureaucrats bear some of the responsibility for institutional failings.<span style="">  </span>In "The Problem of Many Hands," for example, Thompson argues that their responsibility ought to be assessed by a hypothetical criterion based on what the average bureaucrat could accomplish in the circumstances -- he thus invokes a "reasonable bureaucrat standard" (28).<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">A second feature of the account of institutional responsibility defended here concerns justification.<span style="">  </span>In democracies, reasonable persons may disagree about the principles that apply in institutional life.<span style="">  </span>In such cases, individuals ought to be expected to justify their positions and defend them against competing views.<span style="">  </span>For example, in "Judicial Responsibility" Thompson argues that judges act irresponsibly when their legal opinions do not reflect their actual reasons for a judgment.<span style="">  </span>To prevent such occurrences he recommends Kant's view that "no rule can be an acceptable principle of public law unless it can be publicly stated without defeating its own purpose" (81).<span style="">  </span>Legal opinions that cannot meet this criterion should not be regarded as acceptable.<span style="">  </span>It is of considerable interest that the standards of justification Thompson defends are intended, in part, to prevent particular interest groups from having undue influence over institutional outcomes.<span style="">  </span>The position he defends allows experts to determine institutional ethics policies while remaining responsive to communities.<span style="">  </span>Thompson is an advocate of democratic responsiveness, rather than interest group politics.<span style="">  </span>This is evident in "Hospital Ethics" where he argues for the robust use of ethics committees in establishing hospital policies and procedures.<span style="">  </span>Hospitals that do this will, he believes, be in a better position to respond to external pressures and challenges (284-287).<span style="">  </span>By establishing clear ethical norms for hospitals, ethics committees can help to reduce the need for "ethics consults" with the ethics committee that so many medical practitioners are reluctant to request because of the time and energy necessary for a successful consult.<span style="">  </span>There is a tension here, however, between the democratic responsiveness the author advocates, and the role of experts such as those who serve on ethics committees.<span style="">  </span>A typical ethics committee will include experienced physicians, senior nurses, trained social workers, hospital administrators, and at least one medical ethicist. The level of expertise necessary for making sound judgments in many cases is substantial. Yet if a hospital is supposed to be democratically responsive in a serious manner, it must take into account the judgments of community members who may be in fundamental disagreement with the ethics committee while lacking relevant clinical expertise.<span style="">  </span>A committee that can insulate itself against criticism from the community at large by appealing to carefully reasoned ethical judgments grounded in sound clinical expertise may well be in the best interest of the hospital and its patients, but it seems a poor example of democratic responsiveness.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">A third feature of the author's account of institutional responsibility concerns institutional failures.<span style="">  </span>What is to be done in response to the systemic failures at major institutions such as Enron, Arthur Andersen, the Catholic Church, and the FBI?<span style="">  </span>One popular view holds that such institutions, at least those still in existence, need to take proactive, credible steps to ensure that they are staffed and managed by trustworthy individuals.<span style="">  </span>Once this is done, the public at large will again have a legitimate basis for trust. Thompson is more skeptical.<span style="">  </span>He argues in "Restoring Distrust" that we need to institutionalize distrust. At Arthur Andersen, for example, Enron's auditors shared office space with the more lucrative Enron consulting unit of the company.<span style="">  </span>Andersen either trusted that its management consultants would not exert influence over the judgment of its auditors, or it turned a blind eye to the practice.<span style="">  </span>One means of avoiding such conflicts of interest is to institutionalize distrust within organizations.<span style="">  </span>Andersen might have avoided such transparent conflicts of interest if it had built firewalls between its auditors and its management consultants throughout the organization.<span style="">  </span>To do so would not be, as some might contend, to assume that all employees would engage in unscrupulous behavior if given a chance, but instead to recognize that inevitably some will.<span style="">  </span>The prudential deployment of mistrust in an organization might thereby restore the public's trust in the same organization.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The final feature of Thompson's account of institutional ethics concerns his method of analysis.<span style="">  </span>Because, in his judgment, "institutional ethics does not aspire to be a branch of philosophy" its focus should be on institutional norms (7).<span style="">  </span>While he acknowledges the usefulness of codes of conduct, he believes that the attention of applied ethics ought to be on the general principles that govern individual institutions. He eschews altogether the need for theorizing at a deeper level about foundational ethical principles. His reason for this appears to be pragmatic.<span style="">  </span>Debates at this midrange can better accommodate the diverse perspectives of citizens in democratic societies.
