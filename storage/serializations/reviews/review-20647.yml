content: "\xE2\x80\x80<p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Jonathan  Cohen's thoughtful interrogation of <i>Human, All-too-Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">  asks many of the right questions.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup> Often (though perhaps not always) it gets the answers importantly right.  As Cohen remarks, there are relatively few studies of individual Nietzsche  texts, and <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, marking as it does the  transition from the early, metaphysical romanticism to the naturalism that  characterised the remainder of his career, is surely a crucial work. Cohen's study  does not, however, attempt to be comprehensive. There is no discussion of <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">'s praise for the 'noble' religion of the Greeks, its  account of the role of art in a reformed culture, its advocacy of euthanasia and  eugenics, its critique of the modern state,<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup> its advocacy of the disappearance of petty nationalisms in a united  Europe, nor of its ambition that a reformed Western culture should take over the  entire globe. Nor does Cohen discuss either <i>Assorted Opinions and Maxims </i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">or <i>The Wanderer and His Shadow</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> which together, in 1886, became volume II of an expanded <i>Human,  All-too-Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">. Instead, he discusses, as  his title promises, the interrelated themes of science, culture and free-spiritedness as they appear in the  original 1878 work. <i>Human, All-too-Human: Central Themes </i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">might be an alternative title. In addition to examining these -- indeed  central -- themes there is a discussion of the 'literary integrity' of the work  (chapter 6). Here, Cohen is at pains to show that the work is no mere rag-bag of 'aphorisms' but has a literary, even logical, structure. He makes the  original and plausible suggestion that the model for the 1886 expansion of <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> into a two-volume work was Schopenhauer's 1844 addition  of a volume II to the 1818 <i>The World as Will and Representation.</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> A final chapter argues, correctly in my view, that the  basic relationship between science, culture and free-spiritedness established in <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> remains with Nietzsche for the rest of his career.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 1 deals with the  views on science and culture presented in the texts of the early period, <i>The  Birth of Tragedy</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> and the four <i>Untimely  Meditations</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">. As Cohen observes, these  texts are anti-science. In <i>The Birth</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">  science ('Socratism') is held to be that which destroyed the 'Dionysian' metaphysics on which Greek cheerfulness depended, while in  the <i>Untimely</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> <i>Meditations</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> science as 'objective, impartial, and unselective' (p. 65), as a mere 'encyclopaedia of facts'  (p. 68), threatens the unity on which culture depends -- culture being  defined by Nietzsche as a 'unity of artistic style in all the expressions of the  life of a people'. Cohen detects an inherent 'instability' in this early  conception of culture: on the one hand it is supposed to 'cultivate' individuality  which would require it to be 'variegated', but on the other it's supposed to  be unified. (pp. 41-4).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This is, I think, the least  satisfactory chapter. It suffers from trying, in a mere twenty pages, to provide a homogeneous account of five highly individual texts and from not  inquiring more closely into what Nietzsche means by 'science' (<i>Wissenschaft</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">). What actually connects 'science' to the idea of an  'encyclopaedia of facts' is that, most of the time, what he has in mind is not natural  science but rather -- particularly historical -- scholarship. Yet it is not, in  fact, scholarship itself Nietzsche regards as a threat to culture. Rather it  is the unparalleled access nineteenth-century scholarship has provided to past  and foreign cultures (BT 23) that has turned, not science, but rather <i>modern  man</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, into a mere 'walking encyclopaedia'  (UM II 4) and 'fairground motley' (UM I 1). Nietzsche's objection to modernity's information  overload is that it undermines both our meaning-giving faith in our own culture and  our creativity: creativity succumbs to the sense that 'it's all been done  before' so that all that is left is a (postmodern) combination of bits and  pieces of past and alien cultures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A second difficulty in this  opening chapter is the idea that culture cannot be unified and yet at the same  time promote individuality. It seems to me that a central theme that runs  through all Nietzsche's works early and late is precisely the denial of this. As  he says in <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, human  'greatness' consists in 'the very scope and variety of humanity, in unity in  multiplicity' (BGE 212). This mistake, the confusion of unity with homogeneity, is  quite serious because it runs through the whole book. According to Cohen, from  <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> onwards, Nietzsche wants his  readers to learn to be happy in the 'atomism' that is modern culture (pp. 186-7). In fact, however,  'atomized culture' is for Nietzsche always an oxymoron. As early Nietzsche scorns  the 'fairground motley' of modernity, so does Zarathustra: he scorns the  town called 'Motley Cow' not just because of its herd-like character but also because it is 'motley'. He -- Nietzsche -- scorns modernity because it  is 'chaos', a 'half-barbarism' --'half' because though we have no unified <i>Kultur</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> we do have <i>Civilization</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">  (plumbing and the police) (BGE 223-4). Even in <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> itself it is clear that where there is 'culture' there is unity: 'The  greatest fact in the cultivation of Greece remains that Homer became pan-Hellenic  so early . . . for Homer, by centralising, made everything level, and  dissolved the more serious instincts for independence' (HH 262). According to <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">'s volume II the artist of a reformed culture must  recreate such unity: he must<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">emulate  the artists of earlier [Greek] times who imaginatively developed the  existing images of the gods and <i>imaginatively develop</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> a beautiful image of man; he will scent out those cases in which . . . the  great and beautiful soul is still possible, still able to embody itself in the harmonious and well-proportioned, thus acquiring visibility, duration  and the status of a model (AOM 99).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 2 asks why the turn  from the science-hatred of the early works to the science-enthusiasm of <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> happened. Cohen rejects the influence of Paul R\xC3\xA9e as a  sufficient cause and points out that there were no scientific advances between 1874  and 1878 of such a magnitude as to make the power -- and hence claim to  truth -- of modern science unmistakable. (There were, however, tremendous  technological advances between 1840 and 1878 -- railways, the telegraph and the  telephone -- which may have had a delayed impact on Nietzsche's view of science.)  Cohen eventually finds the 'trigger' for Nietzsche's changed outlook in the  first Bayreuth Festival of 1876. The over-heated emotionalism of the  Wagnerians needed calming down by the application of cool scientific method. And  the dispassionate assembly of little, metaphysics-puncturing facts that <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> engages in is ideally suited to the task.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The contrast, here between  hot and cold is insightful. Nietzsche's erstwhile best friend, Erwin Rohde,  complained that <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> transported him  from the 'hot bath' of Nietzsche's romantic-Wagnerian period into an 'ice-room'.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup> Nonetheless, even given Nietzsche's undoubted obsession with Wagner, the  idea that the aim of his turn to science is simply to deal with a couple of  thousand Wagnerians surely makes his target too small. For what he is clearly  entertaining is the idea that a whole-hearted embrace of science and the scientific  spirit will benefit Western culture <i>as a whole</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">.  In this regard it is important, I think, to observe that his and Wagner's  romanticism was always a <i>neo</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">-romanticism, that the  romantic movement proper was long past and that among educated people in the post-Darwinian world 'positivism' was the order of the day. What  Nietzsche is doing in <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, I believe, is finally  embracing the spirit of his age and -- in the experimental way that characterises  all his mature thought -- seeing how well one can live with, and within, it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 3 observes correctly  that the attack on metaphysics in Part I of <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">  is a matter of many local skirmishes ('skirmishes of an untimely man') rather  than the production of one, all-obliterating killer argument. Cohen provides an interesting take on the difficult question of just what the overall  method is that Nietzsche deploys. He sees it as made up of two components. The  first consists in offering alternative naturalistic explanations of phenomena  which the likes of Kant and Schopenhauer appeal to metaphysics to explain. For example, seemingly altruistic actions which for them demand a self that transcends the deterministic world of nature are explained as simply one  drive overcoming another (as a businessman's concern for his reputation might overcome his desire for a quick profit). By themselves, Cohen suggests, 'alternative explanation arguments' only result in a 'draw' between two  equally comprehensive explanatory systems. However, the second string to  Nietzsche's bow, his 'origin of belief' arguments, provides us with a criterion for preferring the naturalistic to the metaphysical explanations. The  systematic demonstration that the <i>causes</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> of  metaphysical beliefs are anything but <i>reasons</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> for  those beliefs -- what causes us to believe that 'deep' music gives us  information about another world is the long association of such music with  metaphysical linguistic images -- provides the missing criterion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Most scholars, I think, would  be inclined to the view that <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">'s  'historical method' consists in 'origin of belief' arguments alone. And it is hard  to assess Cohen's claim that such arguments work in tandem with  'alternative explanation' arguments, since he provides only the one example of such  an explanation mentioned above. Cohen's worry is that while Nietzsche  claims to have 'refuted' metaphysics, to make that claim on the basis of 'origin  of belief' arguments alone is to commit the 'genetic fallacy' (p. 90),  since no matter how bad its causes are a belief may still be true. But since in  the same section in which Nietzsche claims his method 'refutes' metaphysics he  also admits that when all is said and done 'it is [still] true there could be  a metaphysical world' (HH 9), it seems clear that 'refutation' consists in something short of demonstrating falsehood.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 4 introduces those  'for' whom, according to its subtitle, <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> is  written, the 'free spirits'. Free spirits <i>alone</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> --  Cohen rightly emphasises that Nietzsche's aphoristic, or better 'terse', style  of writing is designed to deter the lazy and therefore inappropriate  reader. The first question discussed is: does the intended readership already exist  or does the work have to create its audience by psychoanalysing potential free  spirits into realising their potential? Cohen is inclined to the second  alternative on the grounds that the 1886 preface claims that the 1878 author had to  'invent' his readership in order to compensate for his lack of fellow spirits.  But this looks back in self-pity through the pain of the R\xC3\xA9e-Lou Salom\xC3\xA9-Nietzsche disaster of 1882. In 1872 he certainly regarded R\xC3\xA9e, for one, as a  fellow free spirit. More importantly, as I have argued in my biography, given  Nietzsche's ongoing ambition to found an intellectual-spiritual commune, a  'monastery for free spirits' on the model of his 1876-7 stay in Sorrento with Malwida  von Meysenbug, R\xC3\xA9e and Albert Brenner (during which much of <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> was written), one should view Nietzsche's positivism in  relation to the 'Life Reform Movement', a general, free-spirited movement away from Victorian stuffiness and towards such things as communal living, free  love, vegetarianism, dance, nudism. <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, it  seems to me, is Nietzsche's attempt to steer that movement in his own particular direction.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[5]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Nietzsche writes that 'a free  spirit [is one] who thinks differently from what, on the basis of his origin,  environment, his class and profession, or on the basis of the dominant view of the  age would be expected of him'. Cohen worries that this relativity to background  means that someone brought up a Quaker would have to approve of Bismarck (p.  107). But that confuses conformity with conformism: the free spirit can surely sometimes hold the same opinions as 'fettered spirits' ('herd types') -- driving on the right side of the road, he can agree, is a good idea --  it will just be that mostly the 'thinking' that gets him to those opinions will  be different from that of the fettered spirit -- usually simply in virtue  of <i>being</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> thinking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 5 addresses the  central question of why free spirits are important. And one of the great merits of the  book is that it gets the answer basically right. In Nietzsche's theory of  cultural evolution there is, Cohen observes, a 'division of labour'. The  'fettered spirits' (the <i>Gay Science</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> says that  they must always be in the majority) are those who protect the existing integrity  of a culture, protect it from collapse into chaos. But the free spirits are crucially important because they alone protect a society from cultural 'stagnation', propel it forward to a 'higher' state. A healthy society  needs both the fettered and the free. This means that Nietzsche is to be read  neither as an 'elitist' nor as an 'egalitarian'. He is, rather, a mixture of the  two. Though the free spirits are 'aristocrats of the soul' (if they were not  they would lack the self-confidence to stand out from the herd) they also act  -- with Nietzsche's approval -- for the good of society as a whole. As  Cohen rightly observes, this theory of cultural health (it actually first  appears in the third <i>Untimely Meditation</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> (UM III  6)) stayed with Nietzsche for the rest of his career.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Cohen poses the important  question of just how the free spirits effect cultural transformation, why the  'fettered' majority follows their lead given its hatred of anyone who threatens to  disturb the status quo. I do not, however, find a clear answer to the question.  The real answer seems that mostly the herd does <i>not</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> follow the free spirit -- mostly they get 'martyred' (GM III 9) in one  way or another. Once in a while, however, there is a manifest 'fit' between  desperate need and the novel life-form proposed by the free spirit which overcomes  the innate conservatism of the fettered. (Democracy, socialism and  environmentalism might be candidate examples of such life-forms. One needs to note the similarity between the free spirit and Darwin's 'random mutation' to see  the importance, here, of 'desperate need'.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Nietzsche writes: 'a higher  culture must give man a double brain, as it were two brain-ventricles, one for the perceptions of science the other for non-science' (HH 251). This is  elucidated by section 276's remark that the 'hall of culture' must be large enough  to accommodate 'the arts and music' at one end and 'the spirit of science'  at the other. These passages lead Cohen to the odd view that whereas the free  spirit is a 'paragon of science' the agent of a higher culture must in fact be  an 'ex-free spirit' (p. 172), someone who has transcended the spirit of  science and embraces the arts. But in my judgment the free spirit was never  conceived as a paragon of scient<i>ism</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">. The idea  that he is stems from taking <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">'s positivism to  be the <i>exact</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> affirmation of the  previously despised 'Socratism', the view that nothing other than science is needed for a flourishing life. In fact,  though, Nietzsche is always clear (as, for that matter, are the 'logical  positivists') that science alone cannot create values. But that is precisely the task  of free spirits, those 'seed bearers of the future . . . spiritual colonizers  and shapers of new states and communities' (GS 23).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I have disagreed with Cohen  on a number of points -- in, I hope, a conversational rather than querulous spirit.  Let me end, however, by re-emphasising that this is an important book,  thoughtful, clearly (that is, honestly) written, and utterly sound on the precedence  of the published texts over the <i>Nachlass</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, as  well as on the need to periodize Nietzsche's path of thinking<i>.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>    <div style=\"\">\r\n  <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">    <div style=\"\" id=\"edn1\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> In the following, references to Nietzsche's works will be abbreviated as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">BT  <i>The Birth of Tragedy<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">UM  <i>Untimely Meditation<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">HH  <i>Human, All-too-Human<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">AOM<i> Assorted Opinions and Maxims<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">GS  <i>The Gay Science<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">BGE  <i>Beyond Good and Evil<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">GM  <i>On the Genealogy of Morals<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">TI<span style=\"\">  </span><i>Twilight of the Idols.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Numerals refer  to sections not pages, Roman numerals to parts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn2\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> That culture is threatened by  the 'means to culture' (section 520) is surely a reference not to science (p. 163)  but to Bismarck's state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn3\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> See Julian Young, <i>Friedrich  Nietzsche: a Philosophical Biography</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010) p. 274.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn4\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref4\" name=\"_edn4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span><span style=\"\">Compare, too, the movement of thought in the partly autobiographical </span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'the  true [i.e. metaphysical] world [is] now a . . . superfluous idea -- <i>consequently</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> . . . let us abolish it' (TI IV:  my emphasis).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn5\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref5\" name=\"_edn5\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[5]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> See Young (op. cit.) chapters  14.</span></p>  </div>  </div>"

In fact, however,  'atomized culture' is for Nietzsche always an oxymoron. As early Nietzsche scorns  the 'fairground motley' of modernity, so does Zarathustra: he scorns the  town called 'Motley Cow' not just because of its herd-like character but also because it is 'motley'. He -- Nietzsche -- scorns modernity because it  is 'chaos', a 'half-barbarism' --'half' because though we have no unified <i>Kultur</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> we do have <i>Civilization</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">  (plumbing and the police) (BGE 223-4). Even in <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> itself it is clear that where there is 'culture' there is unity: 'The  greatest fact in the cultivation of Greece remains that Homer became pan-Hellenic  so early . . . for Homer, by centralising, made everything level, and  dissolved the more serious instincts for independence' (HH 262). According to <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">'s volume II the artist of a reformed culture must  recreate such unity: he must<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">emulate  the artists of earlier [Greek] times who imaginatively developed the  existing images of the gods and <i>imaginatively develop</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> a beautiful image of man; he will scent out those cases in which . . . the  great and beautiful soul is still possible, still able to embody itself in the harmonious and well-proportioned, thus acquiring visibility, duration  and the status of a model (AOM 99).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 2 asks why the turn  from the science-hatred of the early works to the science-enthusiasm of <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> happened. Cohen rejects the influence of Paul R\xC3\xA9e as a  sufficient cause and points out that there were no scientific advances between 1874  and 1878 of such a magnitude as to make the power -- and hence claim to  truth -- of modern science unmistakable. (There were, however, tremendous  technological advances between 1840 and 1878 -- railways, the telegraph and the  telephone -- which may have had a delayed impact on Nietzsche's view of science.)  Cohen eventually finds the 'trigger' for Nietzsche's changed outlook in the  first Bayreuth Festival of 1876. The over-heated emotionalism of the  Wagnerians needed calming down by the application of cool scientific method. And  the dispassionate assembly of little, metaphysics-puncturing facts that <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> engages in is ideally suited to the task.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The contrast, here between  hot and cold is insightful. Nietzsche's erstwhile best friend, Erwin Rohde,  complained that <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> transported him  from the 'hot bath' of Nietzsche's romantic-Wagnerian period into an 'ice-room'.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup> Nonetheless, even given Nietzsche's undoubted obsession with Wagner, the  idea that the aim of his turn to science is simply to deal with a couple of  thousand Wagnerians surely makes his target too small. For what he is clearly  entertaining is the idea that a whole-hearted embrace of science and the scientific  spirit will benefit Western culture <i>as a whole</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">.  In this regard it is important, I think, to observe that his and Wagner's  romanticism was always a <i>neo</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">-romanticism, that the  romantic movement proper was long past and that among educated people in the post-Darwinian world 'positivism' was the order of the day. What  Nietzsche is doing in <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, I believe, is finally  embracing the spirit of his age and -- in the experimental way that characterises  all his mature thought -- seeing how well one can live with, and within, it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 3 observes correctly  that the attack on metaphysics in Part I of <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">  is a matter of many local skirmishes ('skirmishes of an untimely man') rather  than the production of one, all-obliterating killer argument. Cohen provides an interesting take on the difficult question of just what the overall  method is that Nietzsche deploys. He sees it as made up of two components. The  first consists in offering alternative naturalistic explanations of phenomena  which the likes of Kant and Schopenhauer appeal to metaphysics to explain. For example, seemingly altruistic actions which for them demand a self that transcends the deterministic world of nature are explained as simply one  drive overcoming another (as a businessman's concern for his reputation might overcome his desire for a quick profit). By themselves, Cohen suggests, 'alternative explanation arguments' only result in a 'draw' between two  equally comprehensive explanatory systems. However, the second string to  Nietzsche's bow, his 'origin of belief' arguments, provides us with a criterion for preferring the naturalistic to the metaphysical explanations. The  systematic demonstration that the <i>causes</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> of  metaphysical beliefs are anything but <i>reasons</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> for  those beliefs -- what causes us to believe that 'deep' music gives us  information about another world is the long association of such music with  metaphysical linguistic images -- provides the missing criterion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Most scholars, I think, would  be inclined to the view that <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">'s  'historical method' consists in 'origin of belief' arguments alone. And it is hard  to assess Cohen's claim that such arguments work in tandem with  'alternative explanation' arguments, since he provides only the one example of such  an explanation mentioned above. Cohen's worry is that while Nietzsche  claims to have 'refuted' metaphysics, to make that claim on the basis of 'origin  of belief' arguments alone is to commit the 'genetic fallacy' (p. 90),  since no matter how bad its causes are a belief may still be true. But since in  the same section in which Nietzsche claims his method 'refutes' metaphysics he  also admits that when all is said and done 'it is [still] true there could be  a metaphysical world' (HH 9), it seems clear that 'refutation' consists in something short of demonstrating falsehood.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 4 introduces those  'for' whom, according to its subtitle, <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> is  written, the 'free spirits'. Free spirits <i>alone</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> --  Cohen rightly emphasises that Nietzsche's aphoristic, or better 'terse', style  of writing is designed to deter the lazy and therefore inappropriate  reader. The first question discussed is: does the intended readership already exist  or does the work have to create its audience by psychoanalysing potential free  spirits into realising their potential? Cohen is inclined to the second  alternative on the grounds that the 1886 preface claims that the 1878 author had to  'invent' his readership in order to compensate for his lack of fellow spirits.  But this looks back in self-pity through the pain of the R\xC3\xA9e-Lou Salom\xC3\xA9-Nietzsche disaster of 1882. In 1872 he certainly regarded R\xC3\xA9e, for one, as a  fellow free spirit. More importantly, as I have argued in my biography, given  Nietzsche's ongoing ambition to found an intellectual-spiritual commune, a  'monastery for free spirits' on the model of his 1876-7 stay in Sorrento with Malwida  von Meysenbug, R\xC3\xA9e and Albert Brenner (during which much of <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> was written), one should view Nietzsche's positivism in  relation to the 'Life Reform Movement', a general, free-spirited movement away from Victorian stuffiness and towards such things as communal living, free  love, vegetarianism, dance, nudism. <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, it  seems to me, is Nietzsche's attempt to steer that movement in his own particular direction.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[5]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Nietzsche writes that 'a free  spirit [is one] who thinks differently from what, on the basis of his origin,  environment, his class and profession, or on the basis of the dominant view of the  age would be expected of him'. Cohen worries that this relativity to background  means that someone brought up a Quaker would have to approve of Bismarck (p.  107). But that confuses conformity with conformism: the free spirit can surely sometimes hold the same opinions as 'fettered spirits' ('herd types') -- driving on the right side of the road, he can agree, is a good idea --  it will just be that mostly the 'thinking' that gets him to those opinions will  be different from that of the fettered spirit -- usually simply in virtue  of <i>being</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> thinking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 5 addresses the  central question of why free spirits are important. And one of the great merits of the  book is that it gets the answer basically right. In Nietzsche's theory of  cultural evolution there is, Cohen observes, a 'division of labour'. The  'fettered spirits' (the <i>Gay Science</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> says that  they must always be in the majority) are those who protect the existing integrity  of a culture, protect it from collapse into chaos. But the free spirits are crucially important because they alone protect a society from cultural 'stagnation', propel it forward to a 'higher' state. A healthy society  needs both the fettered and the free. This means that Nietzsche is to be read  neither as an 'elitist' nor as an 'egalitarian'. He is, rather, a mixture of the  two. Though the free spirits are 'aristocrats of the soul' (if they were not  they would lack the self-confidence to stand out from the herd) they also act  -- with Nietzsche's approval -- for the good of society as a whole. As  Cohen rightly observes, this theory of cultural health (it actually first  appears in the third <i>Untimely Meditation</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> (UM III  6)) stayed with Nietzsche for the rest of his career.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Cohen poses the important  question of just how the free spirits effect cultural transformation, why the  'fettered' majority follows their lead given its hatred of anyone who threatens to  disturb the status quo. I do not, however, find a clear answer to the question.  The real answer seems that mostly the herd does <i>not</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> follow the free spirit -- mostly they get 'martyred' (GM III 9) in one  way or another. Once in a while, however, there is a manifest 'fit' between  desperate need and the novel life-form proposed by the free spirit which overcomes  the innate conservatism of the fettered. (Democracy, socialism and  environmentalism might be candidate examples of such life-forms. One needs to note the similarity between the free spirit and Darwin's 'random mutation' to see  the importance, here, of 'desperate need'.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Nietzsche writes: 'a higher  culture must give man a double brain, as it were two brain-ventricles, one for the perceptions of science the other for non-science' (HH 251). This is  elucidated by section 276's remark that the 'hall of culture' must be large enough  to accommodate 'the arts and music' at one end and 'the spirit of science'  at the other. These passages lead Cohen to the odd view that whereas the free  spirit is a 'paragon of science' the agent of a higher culture must in fact be  an 'ex-free spirit' (p. 172), someone who has transcended the spirit of  science and embraces the arts. But in my judgment the free spirit was never  conceived as a paragon of scient<i>ism</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">. The idea  that he is stems from taking <i>Human</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">'s positivism to  be the <i>exact</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> affirmation of the  previously despised 'Socratism', the view that nothing other than science is needed for a flourishing life. In fact,  though, Nietzsche is always clear (as, for that matter, are the 'logical  positivists') that science alone cannot create values. But that is precisely the task  of free spirits, those 'seed bearers of the future . . . spiritual colonizers  and shapers of new states and communities' (GS 23).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I have disagreed with Cohen  on a number of points -- in, I hope, a conversational rather than querulous spirit.  Let me end, however, by re-emphasising that this is an important book,  thoughtful, clearly (that is, honestly) written, and utterly sound on the precedence  of the published texts over the <i>Nachlass</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, as  well as on the need to periodize Nietzsche's path of thinking<i>.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>    <div style=\"\">\r\n  <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">    <div style=\"\" id=\"edn1\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> In the following, references to Nietzsche's works will be abbreviated as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">BT  <i>The Birth of Tragedy<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">UM  <i>Untimely Meditation<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">HH  <i>Human, All-too-Human<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">AOM<i> Assorted Opinions and Maxims<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">GS  <i>The Gay Science<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">BGE  <i>Beyond Good and Evil<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">GM  <i>On the Genealogy of Morals<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">TI<span style=\"\">  </span><i>Twilight of the Idols.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Numerals refer  to sections not pages, Roman numerals to parts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn2\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> That culture is threatened by  the 'means to culture' (section 520) is surely a reference not to science (p. 163)  but to Bismarck's state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn3\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> See Julian Young, <i>Friedrich  Nietzsche: a Philosophical Biography</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010) p. 274.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn4\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref4\" name=\"_edn4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span><span style=\"\">Compare, too, the movement of thought in the partly autobiographical </span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'the  true [i.e. metaphysical] world [is] now a . . . superfluous idea -- <i>consequently</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> . . . let us abolish it' (TI IV:  my emphasis).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn5\">  <p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref5\" name=\"_edn5\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"\">[5]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> See Young (op. cit.) chapters  14.</span></p>  </div>  </div>"
