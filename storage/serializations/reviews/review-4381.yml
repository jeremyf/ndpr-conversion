content: "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From Plato\xE2\x80\x99s banishment of the poets from the Republic to Ayer\xE2\x80\x99s dismissal of aesthetics (alongside normative ethics) as a legitimate field of philosophical inquiry, aesthetics has often been treated as the red-headed stepchild of philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span>Gregory Currie blames this state of affairs in recent times on aestheticians who have attempted to \xE2\x80\x9Ccarve out a domain of problems about the arts that could be investigated without serious help from other areas of philosophy.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>This attempt, he believes, resulted in \xE2\x80\x9Cstagnation and marginalization,\xE2\x80\x9D since many problems about the arts depend for their solution on the philosophies of mind and language, and on psychological theories of human development.<span style=\"\">  </span>Currie hastens to add that the stagnation and marginalization of aesthetics has, at this point in time, been largely reversed.<span style=\"\">  </span>He also believes that at least some problems in aesthetics are not illuminated by empirical research (whether or not he believes there can be a philosophy of art that isn\xE2\x80\x99t derivative from other philosophical disciplines he does not say).<span style=\"\">  </span>Nevertheless, this book is offered as an attempt to address several of the thorniest problems in aesthetics within a broader philosophical context.<span style=\"\">  </span>Even if he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t solve these problems outright, Currie hopes to show that any solution that neglects the broader context is doomed to failure. </p>     <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> The book is a collection of thirteen papers written over the past twelve years.<span style=\"\">  </span>Five of the papers are appearing for the first time in this volume.<span style=\"\">  </span>Three others have been substantially revised.<span style=\"\">  </span>The papers vary greatly in topic and focus.<span style=\"\">  </span>Some ask grand questions about the nature of interpretation (in narrative works of fiction and in general), the ontological status of fictional characters, and the possibility of a \xE2\x80\x9Cliterary philosophy of time.\xE2\x80\x9D Others explore very narrow aesthetic questions, e.g. what is a documentary, what is the nature and limits of genre, what does it mean for a narrative to be unreliable.<span style=\"\">  </span>Though all of the essays are well crafted and well argued, the book as a whole, unified as it is under the rather weak them of \xE2\x80\x9Caesthetics within, and dependent on, a broader context\xE2\x80\x9D, does not really exist except as a vehicle for the publication of some new essays and the revision of some previously published work.<span style=\"\">  </span></p>     <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> There is one essay, one of the previously unpublished ones, that is not only interesting in its own right but also deals explicitly with the book\xE2\x80\x99s general theme of aesthetics\xE2\x80\x99 dependence on other philosophical and empirical disciplines.<span style=\"\">  </span>The essay is entitled \xE2\x80\x9CInterpretation and Pragmatics\xE2\x80\x9D, and argues for author-intentionalism \xE2\x80\x93 the highly contentious view that interpretation of narrative art works involves deciphering in some way the intentions of the work\xE2\x80\x99s author.<span style=\"\">  </span>Currie is well aware of the long tradition that stands in opposition to this view, but believes that this opposition rests on a mistake: \xE2\x80\x9C[I]n the course of the large-scale philosophizing which has driven [movements in semiotic, new critical, and structuralist traditions], their advocates have not given us plausible, detailed and empirically testable hypotheses about how people actually go about interpreting the things they hear and read.<span style=\"\">  </span>Indeed, they don\xE2\x80\x99t seem to have thought of this as a relevant part of the project.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>Currie believes that aesthetics must be informed by other philosophical and empirical disciplines, that aesthetic activity is a psychological activity.<span style=\"\">  </span>And the act of aesthetic interpretation is a species of communication generally.<span style=\"\">  </span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Currie\xE2\x80\x99s argument in this essay is based on recent work in the philosophy of language which seeks to explain the way we process communicative acts as a function of efficient stimuli processing in general.<span style=\"\">  </span>We have \xE2\x80\x9Cevolved to be seekers of relevance: [we] seek to process stimuli so as to get the maximum cognitive effect for the minimum effort.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>Since the aim of a communicative act is the transmission of some cognitive content from speaker to hearer, the most efficient way of dealing with communicative acts \xE2\x80\x93 the way to get the maximum cognitive effect with the least effort \xE2\x80\x93 is to ascertain the speaker\xE2\x80\x99s intended meaning. Since works of art are a species of communicative act, interpreting these works must also be a matter of ascertaining the speaker\xE2\x80\x99s, i.e. the artist\xE2\x80\x99s, intentions.<span style=\"\">  </span></p>     <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Currie further refines his argument by differentiating two basic claims made by author-intentionalism: \xE2\x80\x9C1) We use the text, together with various other things, to come up with the best ideas we can about what the author intended to convey; 2) legitimate interpretations are exactly those that correspond with what the author intended to convey.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>His position is a \xE2\x80\x9Crevised\xE2\x80\x9D author-intentionalism because he endorses the first claim but rejects the second. Currie also embraces a pluralistic, as opposed to a monistic, theory of interpretation, which means that he believes that there can be at least two contrasting, equally legitimate interpretations of the same work.<span style=\"\">  </span>So his view is not the nearly universally rejected, rather na\xC3\xAFve view that appreciating art means figuring out what the author had in mind when she created the work \xE2\x80\x93 a view that reduces aesthetic activity to a kind of puzzle solving.<span style=\"\">  </span>Rather, he argues that \xE2\x80\x9Can interpretation of the work cannot be legitimate unless it provides us with a way of seeing the text of the work as an appropriate vehicle for the intentional communication of that very interpretation.\xE2\x80\x9D Works can support various interpretations, but any interpretation, if it is to be legitimate, must be something that the author <i>could</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> have intended.<span style=\"\">  </span>Currie clarifies this point by appealing to the distinction between utterer and utterance. The aim of interpretation is not to figure out what was in the mind of the utterer \xE2\x80\x93 the artist \xE2\x80\x93 but to find a meaning in the utterance that is supported by the linguistic properties of that utterance.<span style=\"\">  </span>The discussion is rounded out with references to recent studies in experimental psychology with normal and autistic children that establish various links between language skills and the ability to decipher the intentions of speakers. </span></p>     <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Though Currie begins this essay by drawing a sharp line between his position and that of the opponents of author-intentionalism, his final, revised version of author intentionalism doesn\xE2\x80\x99t seem all that far from the opposition. Assuming that narrative, and especially literary, art works should indeed be viewed as communicative acts (though I personally am sympathetic to this view, Currie never provides an argument for it, at least in this book), and conceding that a legitimate interpretation must indeed be supported by the linguistic and stylistic properties of the text, it is not clear to me where an author\xE2\x80\x99s intentions come into play.<span style=\"\">  </span>Isn\xE2\x80\x99t it simply enough to say that a legitimate interpretation must be supported by the text? Why is it necessary to add that an author must have been capable of reasonably intending any legitimate interpretation?<span style=\"\">  </span>What does talk of intentions gain us here?</p>     <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Another problem with Currie\xE2\x80\x99s account is its ambivalence between the ontology and axiology of interpretation.<span style=\"\">  </span>Appealing to the empirically verifiable mechanism of interpretation \xE2\x80\x93 to the way people actually interpret what they hear and read \xE2\x80\x93 seems to signal an ontology of interpretation.<span style=\"\">  </span>And yet Currie talks about distinguishing \xE2\x80\x9Clegitimate\xE2\x80\x9D interpretations from \xE2\x80\x9Cillegitimate\xE2\x80\x9D ones, which is clearly an axiological concern.<span style=\"\">  </span>Does the empirical study of how people really interpret the things they hear and read explain what interpretation is and must be, or does it help us distinguish good interpretations from bad ones?<span style=\"\">    </span></p>     <p class=\"MsoNormal\">This brings me to my final criticism of the essay, which is also a criticism of the book\xE2\x80\x99s unifying theme.<span style=\"\">  </span>I take is as uncontroversial that, to a certain extent, an understanding of the fundamental psychological/biological workings of the human mind is important for any philosophical theory that takes the human mind as its object.<span style=\"\">  </span>We cannot fully understand intentional states without understanding how the mind is able to generate a mental state per se.<span style=\"\">  </span>A theory of scientific knowledge depends in part on an understanding of how the human senses perceive the physical world and under what conditions sensory data are reliable.<span style=\"\">  </span>Any conception of music operates within the context of the empirically measurable range of sound waves audible to the human ear.<span style=\"\">  </span>And so on.<span style=\"\">  </span>However, it is a truism that while many philosophical theories need the empirical sciences to provide them with context and limits, the reason we have philosophy at all is that third-person scientific discourse, while very good at providing the what and the how, has very little to say about the why.<span style=\"\">  </span>In other words, our philosophical theories have to operate within the realm of the possible, which is determined by empirical science, but they must also go beyond empirical science if they are to be in any way useful.<span style=\"\">  </span></p>       <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.3in;\">Interpretation is not just a matter of mental processes and the mechanics of communication and reception.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is an aesthetic activity that is subject to evaluative criteria \xE2\x80\x93 there is a right way and a wrong way to interpret a narrative art work, and interpretation plays an important role in art creation (various performances \xE2\x80\x93 theatrical, musical, cinematic \xE2\x80\x93 involve a type of interpretation), criticism, and assessment.<span style=\"\">  </span>Understanding the psychological process that underlies reception of narrative art works can help set the limits of a philosophical theory of interpretation.<span style=\"\">  </span>But understanding the basic mechanism of interpretation will not be very helpful in understanding the complex role interpretation plays in many aesthetic activities, and it will only be helpful in understanding what role interpretation <i>ought</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to play by setting the limits of the \xE2\x80\x9Ccan\xE2\x80\x9D implied by any proposed \xE2\x80\x9Cought.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>It is certainly not clear how Currie\xE2\x80\x99s revised intentionalism is helpful in these matters.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gregory Currie is a highly influential, highly prolific philosopher of art who has, in this and other works, succeeded in combining aesthetics with other disciplines, enriching the field in the process.<span style=\"\">  </span>But I remain unconvinced that aesthetics must of necessity appeal to other philosophical disciplines and the sciences in order to solve its various problems.<span style=\"\">  </span>This book, though valuable as a collection of some important and interesting essays, does not succeed as a unified work.<span style=\"\">  </span></p>"
