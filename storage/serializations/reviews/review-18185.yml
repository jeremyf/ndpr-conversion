content: "\xE2\x80\x80<p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Alejandro Vallega's new book,<i> Sense and Finitude: Encounters at the Limits of Language, Art, and the Political</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, is admirable both in its location of finitude as the key positive insight in Heidegger and in its effort, having admitted the cogency of Heidegger's technology-critique, nonetheless to maintain a certain distance from Heidegger's univocal understanding of Western History. Vallega's text also forms a significant contribution to the reception of Heidegger's <i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, his recently translated 1936 text documenting the German thinker's mapping of a project that, in hindsight, seems to have remained remarkably stable from the mid-1930s until his death in 1976.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">More problematically, Vallega argues for the continuity of Heidegger's thought from early through late, a task for which the <i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> is especially handy. While, from my perspective, the chasm of his response to modernity opens between the two periods, there can be little doubt that, in some form, the question of finitude remains a constant for Heidegger. Recognizing this, the initial four chapters of <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> use the <i>Contributions to Philosophy</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> to link the analyses of \"mood\", \"thrownness\", etc., from earlier texts such as <i>Being and Time</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> and the <i>Basic Problems of Phenomenology</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> to the later work with its technology critique and accompanying announcement of the \"end of metaphysics\". For Vallega, as was certainly true for Heidegger from 1936 onward, the task of living honestly as mortal human beings -- i.e., of living in a fashion that acknowledges the transcience of our experience and lives -- demands above all a response to modern technology as \"what's happening\" in our world. Of course, what \"modern technology\" means is best captured by the preferred term from the <i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, \"machination\", rather than any word implying criticism of technological objects or strategies: what Heidegger, and Vallega, have in mind, is the basic \"way of seeing the world\" that leads to the development of technologies -- a <i>mode of being</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> which increasingly reduces <i>everything</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> to its \"potential usefulness\" in such a project of control: \"the future depends on the urgent production of results and technological implements for shaping and making the future safe and secure through the expansion <i>ad infinitum</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of rational quantitative productions of meanings and goods\" (p. 15).</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Vallega's Heideggerian emphasis upon \"safety and security\" already suggests why such a transformation of societies in the image of modern technology becomes an urgent problem for philosophers concerned with finitude. That is, the very mainspring of \"machination\" is an effort to forget a basic <i>insecurity</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> at the foundation of human life. To the extent that such control increasingly becomes the mania of our world, that world distracts from what matters -- even though life within it is the only possibility for any authenticity.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The difficulty posed by technology is not simply that it is a <i>distraction</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, for, as a fundamental pair of glasses through which we perceive and even produce reality, \"machination\" or \"modern technology\" distracts us so thoroughly that it actively hides finitude. In Heidegger's terms, our age corresponds to the \"end of metaphysics\" or the \"completion of nihilism\" -- when the basic impulse of Western metaphysics to reduce Being to the presence of beings comes to term in subjective representation and a complete repression of Being itself, as that which cannot be so reduced. The task of controlling nature and human nature entirely occupies our time and attention -- so thoroughly that what evades such pragmatism seems no longer to concern us. Because of this hijacking of our concerns, our age emerges, as Vallega quotes Heidegger from the <i>Contributions to Philosophy</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, as \"the epoch of the total lack of questioning\" (Vallega, p. 13; <i>Contributions</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, p. 76).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">While climbing rather far into the Heideggerian hermeneutic-machine, Vallega does also insist upon a limit beyond which he can't follow Heidegger. It's important to note that, according to Vallega, the task of acknowledging finitude in the age of modern machination produces <i>two</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> answers in Heidegger's work: first, there's the response that Heidegger articulates most infamously in his late interview with <i>Der Spiegel</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, \"Only a god can save us now.\"<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup> That is, to provide any real hope for change, the emphasis upon a univocal history of the West demands a similarly unified (and miraculous) transformation of its course, the equivalent of divine intervention. This is the side of Heidegger that leads interpreters to accusations of quietism and fatalism.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Secondly, though, Heidegger's repeated accounts of \"machination\" and \"the essence of modern technology\" circle around an immanent possibility for challenging technological domination. Modern technology and the language carrying its dominance both suppress and depend upon something like finitude: the mania to bring everything into representational control by making it conceptually present depends, unacknowledged, upon a temporality (among other things a temporality of <i>language</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">) that defies it. Because of this, Heidegger and Vallega insist that </span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\">the emergence of a beyond to representation and technological instrumentalization belongs to the essence of technology. But <i>this</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> passage beyond modern technology is just as concrete, particular, transitory and multiple as the other one is unified and unchanging. Here the philosopher is, above all, an <i>interpreter</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> and a figure who can, in her labors, actively struggle with technological hegemony, opening multiple new paths for understanding an otherwise technicized world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\">The structure of <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> builds off of this tension between two paths to finitude in the technological age, embracing the latter one (the immanent possibility of reclaiming the poetry already in language) while distancing the author from the \"fateful\" Heidegger. Thus, Vallega's initial 3 chapters -- the first three \"meditations\" on Heidegger's </span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> -- not only raise the problem of finitude in relationship to modern technology but also (Meditation 2) demonstrate how the apparently a-temporal domination of the technical always also carries with it an essentially temporal \"decomposition\" (p. 20), and show how such decay is an essential aspect of language and \"mood\" (Meditation 3). Following upon these, the fourth and final Meditation in the series, criticizes the <i>other</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> Heidegger, the one for whom \"the thought that is coming is always already situated under the one destiny, the destiny of Western thought\" (p. 46). Or, to be more precise, Vallega detects in Heidegger a paralyzing ambivalence, one which immobilizes him between, on the one hand, articulating the unity of the technological world's historical arc and, on the other hand, the \"joyful\" task of re-temporalizing and multiplying meanings within that world we tend to <i>see</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> only in its unitary presence.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Having, with the 4<sup>th</sup> Meditation in <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> reached the extent of his argument, Vallega reserves the rest of his book for essays engaging in the opening work that he takes to be the valid form of response to modern technology. After a chapter on Charles Scott's efforts in <i>The Time of Memory</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> to complexify our view of the Greeks, the rest of <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> works along two axes. First, there is a part dedicated to the concrete operations of language (with essays on Plato's <i>Phaedrus</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, on Celan's poetry and Gadamer's interpretation of it and, finally, on the Derrida/Artauld relationship). Then, in the final section Vallega returns to artistic, cultural and political issues to indicate how language's work can change those fields -- here with a fine chapter on Benjamin's notion of art today but also essays on the transformation of culture by Garcia-Marquez and Fanon and, finally, on Italo Calvino's inviting notion of a \"politics of lightness\".</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">It's worth focusing a bit more closely on the Calvino chapter, which also forms the conclusion of <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, for it both summarizes the strategy of the book as a whole and indicates what I take to be problematic about it. Vallega admires Calvino's literary <i>strategy</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> when faced with increased technological homogenization of culture, a strategy of re-importing the aesthetic playfulness of language. Story-tellers -- so Calvino and Vallega -- operate in a language-world where they need not claim a \"heavy\" transparency of meaning, a clarity that would erase the mind's capacity to draw ever-new connections between ideas or to expand ideas in unanticipated directions.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">However, having suggested the idea of a politics that would operate in this key, Vallega then checks himself, suggesting, indeed, that a philosophical text such as his own <i>cannot</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> attain the quality to which Calvino aspires; he admits that \"it might be almost impossible to sustain lightness and quickness\" when the task is philosophical, a \"thinking through\" of \"the exactness and plurality of words\" (p. 167). Indeed, Vallega seems to admit that his own writing -- which must frame the <i>problem</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of modern technology in also presenting its preferred <i>answer to</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> that problem -- makes an irreducibly \"heavy\" impression for all of its virtues. Or, to put it in a slightly different way, isn't Vallega's writing (and the writing of all those who follow this later Heideggerian path to finitude) cursed with a kind of self-hatred of the philosopher, an attitude according to which theoretical reflection is itself a burden to be overcome only in a \"<i>poiesis</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\" alien to the representational discourse of philosophy?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, then, marks its own failure to measure up to \"lightness\". Its author admits that he himself has come up short against his aspiration. However, rather than asserting, as does Vallega, that such failure is itself a by-product of finitude, an inevitable price for thought to pay, I would suggest that the conundrum only holds so long as we accept the thesis that Heidegger's project remains constant before and after the \"turn\" in 1934-5. Against Vallega's thesis, which of course itself challenges the \"traditional\" Heidegger of Richardson, P\xC3\xB6ggeler, von Hermann and others,<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup> I would propose the contemporary argument of Slavoj \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek, who would have us believe that the <i>appearance</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of continuity in Heidegger's work, Heidegger's continued use of language and categories of finitude from the earlier period, is misleading.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">It is misleading because the very <i>meaning</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of finitude changes in a fatal way after 1934. For \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek, finitude as it emerges in Heidegger's earlier texts, from <i>Being and Time</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> through <i>Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, is a specifically <i>modern</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> and <i>radically subjectivist</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> concept. What \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek means by this can be seen in <i>Being and Time</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> where the analysis of Dasein's finitude leads inexorably to the theme of an irreducible decision -- that of \"anticipatory resoluteness\" as articulated in section 62. The insight \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek finds there is a <i>doubling</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of the merely \"existentialist\" ideas according to which, as finite, mortal beings, we can never <i>know</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> the truth about our reality. For \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek, on the contrary, \"anticipatory resoluteness\" -- as an act of decision -- <i>is</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> a kind of <i>praxical knowledge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of reality, one affirming that the world \"is not\", that it has no totality or fixed order. As a knowledge only available <i>in acting</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek takes it as radically <i>subjective</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, as self-consciously <i>produced</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> by the subject precisely in affirming the impossibility that one <i>might</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> discover any normative measure in the world. </span><span style=\"font-family: Times;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">In other words, a sufficient understanding of the earlier Heidegger requires that we take Being itself to lack truth, to lack another, broader horizon to which one might appeal for the way \"things really are\". This means that the ontological horizon doesn't primarily indicate \"something else/more/beyond\" beings which organizes them as a whole, but rather the immanent \"finitude\" of the world itself, a finitude beyond which there is, literally, \"nothing\" -- only Dasein itself in its subjective nullity.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">By way of contrast, the \"finitude\" of the <i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> and later texts is an effort to re-ground the human being in a more encompassing order -- even when that order is conceived in terms of radical historicity. <i>We</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> are finite, over and against what is -- not Being. The inevitable symptom of such a neo-medievalism is the demand to abandon an imagined \"hubris\" of modern self-assertion in a response to it that emphasizes \"letting be\" or attunement. That's why in, for example, \"The Question Concerning Technology\", any intervention in the destiny of Being is conceived as a kind of <i>mimesis</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, a reflection and extension of the <i>poietic</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> structure of Being itself.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Of course, the reason for both Heidegger's <i>own</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> flight from modernist subjectivism and for later critiques of such a modernist <i>residuum</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> lies in politics, in the politics of Heidegger's Nazi period. \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek argues, contra-Habermas and numerous Heidegger critics, that the problem in 1933 was Heidegger's increasing <i>ambivalence </i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">about the modern subject, his subtle retreat from a language of extra-personal and extra-communal \"will\" to a discourse of \"the <i>volk</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\" and its analogue in the isolated individual (See \"Why Heidegger\", pp. 230-25). In other words, for \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek, Heidegger's failure wasn't that he went <i>too far</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> in his modernism. Rather, for him Heidegger didn't go <i>far enough</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> in his subjectivism -- to an insubstantial subject and to a collective irreducible to any substantial identity.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[5]</span></span></a></sup></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The relevance of the \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEekian argument for Vallega's <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> is simply that it responsibly retrieves a philosophy indebted to Heidegger on finitude from the very \"heaviness\" that is the inevitable price for a thought claiming to transcend all forms of the modern subject. \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek's tack saves Heidegger from himself, from his retreat to a sterile anti-modernism. Such an approach raises two further questions, though, queries toward whose answer I can only gesture here: first, I would defend Vallega's insistence that we bring together the question of finitude with an examination of the historical present as crisis. What happens to the critique of contemporary social and historical forms implied by this synthesis? What happens to \"the question concerning technology\" when we keep Heidegger's valid insight within a subjectivist understanding? As I have argued in my own recent book, <i>\xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek and Heidegger: the question concerning techno-capitalism</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> (Continuum: 2008), the result is actually quite encouraging. \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek himself turns out to be a more interesting critic of contemporary social forms <i>as outgrowths of fundamental choices belonging to modernity</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> than was Heidegger himself.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The other issue that Vallega's approach in <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> raises for any effort to separate off a radical-modernist Heidegger deals with what I might call the <i>poetic</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> or even (contra-Heidegger's own usage of the term) <i>aesthetic</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> dimension. While \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek makes an excellent corrective to Vallega's (and Heidegger's) <i>over-reliance</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> on this dimension -- to the tendency to reduce possible responses to \"machination\" to the limits of \"poetry\" -- he is perhaps <i>too</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> successful in expunging the \"work of art\", as Heidegger puns it, from the labor of political change. \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek misses the aesthetic <i>per se</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, though his work is rich in examples from the arts and cinema. I take Vallega's insistence upon and sensitivity to art's \"work\", particularly as exemplified in his sensitive interpretations of Paul Celan or of Calvino himself, to be a useful starting place for a dialogue between two inheritances of Heidegger's legacy in thinking about finitude. It's in this context that I welcome <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> as a valuable contribution to contemporary continental philosophy.</span></p>    \r\n  <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">    <div style=\"\" id=\"edn1\">  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> Martin Heidegger, <i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis)</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, <i>Gesamtausgabe</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> Band 65 (Frankfurt am Main: Vittorio Klostermann, 1983); <i>Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, translated by Parvis Emad and Kenneth Maly (Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana UP, 1999); hereafter, <i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> or <i>Contributions</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn2\">  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> The phrase comes from Heidegger's famous interview with <i>Der Spiegel</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, first published in 1976 but from 1966. \"<i>Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\", Der Spiegel, 31 May 1976.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn3\">  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> See William J.

Because of this, Heidegger and Vallega insist that </span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\">the emergence of a beyond to representation and technological instrumentalization belongs to the essence of technology. But <i>this</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> passage beyond modern technology is just as concrete, particular, transitory and multiple as the other one is unified and unchanging. Here the philosopher is, above all, an <i>interpreter</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> and a figure who can, in her labors, actively struggle with technological hegemony, opening multiple new paths for understanding an otherwise technicized world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\">The structure of <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> builds off of this tension between two paths to finitude in the technological age, embracing the latter one (the immanent possibility of reclaiming the poetry already in language) while distancing the author from the \"fateful\" Heidegger. Thus, Vallega's initial 3 chapters -- the first three \"meditations\" on Heidegger's </span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> -- not only raise the problem of finitude in relationship to modern technology but also (Meditation 2) demonstrate how the apparently a-temporal domination of the technical always also carries with it an essentially temporal \"decomposition\" (p. 20), and show how such decay is an essential aspect of language and \"mood\" (Meditation 3). Following upon these, the fourth and final Meditation in the series, criticizes the <i>other</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> Heidegger, the one for whom \"the thought that is coming is always already situated under the one destiny, the destiny of Western thought\" (p. 46). Or, to be more precise, Vallega detects in Heidegger a paralyzing ambivalence, one which immobilizes him between, on the one hand, articulating the unity of the technological world's historical arc and, on the other hand, the \"joyful\" task of re-temporalizing and multiplying meanings within that world we tend to <i>see</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> only in its unitary presence.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Having, with the 4<sup>th</sup> Meditation in <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> reached the extent of his argument, Vallega reserves the rest of his book for essays engaging in the opening work that he takes to be the valid form of response to modern technology. After a chapter on Charles Scott's efforts in <i>The Time of Memory</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> to complexify our view of the Greeks, the rest of <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> works along two axes. First, there is a part dedicated to the concrete operations of language (with essays on Plato's <i>Phaedrus</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, on Celan's poetry and Gadamer's interpretation of it and, finally, on the Derrida/Artauld relationship). Then, in the final section Vallega returns to artistic, cultural and political issues to indicate how language's work can change those fields -- here with a fine chapter on Benjamin's notion of art today but also essays on the transformation of culture by Garcia-Marquez and Fanon and, finally, on Italo Calvino's inviting notion of a \"politics of lightness\".</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">It's worth focusing a bit more closely on the Calvino chapter, which also forms the conclusion of <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, for it both summarizes the strategy of the book as a whole and indicates what I take to be problematic about it. Vallega admires Calvino's literary <i>strategy</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> when faced with increased technological homogenization of culture, a strategy of re-importing the aesthetic playfulness of language. Story-tellers -- so Calvino and Vallega -- operate in a language-world where they need not claim a \"heavy\" transparency of meaning, a clarity that would erase the mind's capacity to draw ever-new connections between ideas or to expand ideas in unanticipated directions.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">However, having suggested the idea of a politics that would operate in this key, Vallega then checks himself, suggesting, indeed, that a philosophical text such as his own <i>cannot</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> attain the quality to which Calvino aspires; he admits that \"it might be almost impossible to sustain lightness and quickness\" when the task is philosophical, a \"thinking through\" of \"the exactness and plurality of words\" (p. 167). Indeed, Vallega seems to admit that his own writing -- which must frame the <i>problem</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of modern technology in also presenting its preferred <i>answer to</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> that problem -- makes an irreducibly \"heavy\" impression for all of its virtues. Or, to put it in a slightly different way, isn't Vallega's writing (and the writing of all those who follow this later Heideggerian path to finitude) cursed with a kind of self-hatred of the philosopher, an attitude according to which theoretical reflection is itself a burden to be overcome only in a \"<i>poiesis</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\" alien to the representational discourse of philosophy?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, then, marks its own failure to measure up to \"lightness\". Its author admits that he himself has come up short against his aspiration. However, rather than asserting, as does Vallega, that such failure is itself a by-product of finitude, an inevitable price for thought to pay, I would suggest that the conundrum only holds so long as we accept the thesis that Heidegger's project remains constant before and after the \"turn\" in 1934-5. Against Vallega's thesis, which of course itself challenges the \"traditional\" Heidegger of Richardson, P\xC3\xB6ggeler, von Hermann and others,<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup> I would propose the contemporary argument of Slavoj \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek, who would have us believe that the <i>appearance</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of continuity in Heidegger's work, Heidegger's continued use of language and categories of finitude from the earlier period, is misleading.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">It is misleading because the very <i>meaning</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of finitude changes in a fatal way after 1934. For \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek, finitude as it emerges in Heidegger's earlier texts, from <i>Being and Time</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> through <i>Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, is a specifically <i>modern</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> and <i>radically subjectivist</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> concept. What \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek means by this can be seen in <i>Being and Time</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> where the analysis of Dasein's finitude leads inexorably to the theme of an irreducible decision -- that of \"anticipatory resoluteness\" as articulated in section 62. The insight \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek finds there is a <i>doubling</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of the merely \"existentialist\" ideas according to which, as finite, mortal beings, we can never <i>know</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> the truth about our reality. For \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek, on the contrary, \"anticipatory resoluteness\" -- as an act of decision -- <i>is</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> a kind of <i>praxical knowledge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> of reality, one affirming that the world \"is not\", that it has no totality or fixed order. As a knowledge only available <i>in acting</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek takes it as radically <i>subjective</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, as self-consciously <i>produced</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> by the subject precisely in affirming the impossibility that one <i>might</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> discover any normative measure in the world. </span><span style=\"font-family: Times;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">In other words, a sufficient understanding of the earlier Heidegger requires that we take Being itself to lack truth, to lack another, broader horizon to which one might appeal for the way \"things really are\". This means that the ontological horizon doesn't primarily indicate \"something else/more/beyond\" beings which organizes them as a whole, but rather the immanent \"finitude\" of the world itself, a finitude beyond which there is, literally, \"nothing\" -- only Dasein itself in its subjective nullity.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">By way of contrast, the \"finitude\" of the <i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> and later texts is an effort to re-ground the human being in a more encompassing order -- even when that order is conceived in terms of radical historicity. <i>We</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> are finite, over and against what is -- not Being. The inevitable symptom of such a neo-medievalism is the demand to abandon an imagined \"hubris\" of modern self-assertion in a response to it that emphasizes \"letting be\" or attunement. That's why in, for example, \"The Question Concerning Technology\", any intervention in the destiny of Being is conceived as a kind of <i>mimesis</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, a reflection and extension of the <i>poietic</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> structure of Being itself.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Of course, the reason for both Heidegger's <i>own</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> flight from modernist subjectivism and for later critiques of such a modernist <i>residuum</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> lies in politics, in the politics of Heidegger's Nazi period. \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek argues, contra-Habermas and numerous Heidegger critics, that the problem in 1933 was Heidegger's increasing <i>ambivalence </i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">about the modern subject, his subtle retreat from a language of extra-personal and extra-communal \"will\" to a discourse of \"the <i>volk</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\" and its analogue in the isolated individual (See \"Why Heidegger\", pp. 230-25). In other words, for \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek, Heidegger's failure wasn't that he went <i>too far</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> in his modernism. Rather, for him Heidegger didn't go <i>far enough</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> in his subjectivism -- to an insubstantial subject and to a collective irreducible to any substantial identity.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[5]</span></span></a></sup></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The relevance of the \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEekian argument for Vallega's <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> is simply that it responsibly retrieves a philosophy indebted to Heidegger on finitude from the very \"heaviness\" that is the inevitable price for a thought claiming to transcend all forms of the modern subject. \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek's tack saves Heidegger from himself, from his retreat to a sterile anti-modernism. Such an approach raises two further questions, though, queries toward whose answer I can only gesture here: first, I would defend Vallega's insistence that we bring together the question of finitude with an examination of the historical present as crisis. What happens to the critique of contemporary social and historical forms implied by this synthesis? What happens to \"the question concerning technology\" when we keep Heidegger's valid insight within a subjectivist understanding? As I have argued in my own recent book, <i>\xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek and Heidegger: the question concerning techno-capitalism</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> (Continuum: 2008), the result is actually quite encouraging. \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek himself turns out to be a more interesting critic of contemporary social forms <i>as outgrowths of fundamental choices belonging to modernity</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> than was Heidegger himself.</span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The other issue that Vallega's approach in <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> raises for any effort to separate off a radical-modernist Heidegger deals with what I might call the <i>poetic</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> or even (contra-Heidegger's own usage of the term) <i>aesthetic</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> dimension. While \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek makes an excellent corrective to Vallega's (and Heidegger's) <i>over-reliance</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> on this dimension -- to the tendency to reduce possible responses to \"machination\" to the limits of \"poetry\" -- he is perhaps <i>too</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> successful in expunging the \"work of art\", as Heidegger puns it, from the labor of political change. \xC5\xBDi\xC5\xBEek misses the aesthetic <i>per se</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, though his work is rich in examples from the arts and cinema. I take Vallega's insistence upon and sensitivity to art's \"work\", particularly as exemplified in his sensitive interpretations of Paul Celan or of Calvino himself, to be a useful starting place for a dialogue between two inheritances of Heidegger's legacy in thinking about finitude. It's in this context that I welcome <i>Sense and Finitude</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> as a valuable contribution to contemporary continental philosophy.</span></p>    \r\n  <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">    <div style=\"\" id=\"edn1\">  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> Martin Heidegger, <i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis)</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, <i>Gesamtausgabe</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> Band 65 (Frankfurt am Main: Vittorio Klostermann, 1983); <i>Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, translated by Parvis Emad and Kenneth Maly (Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana UP, 1999); hereafter, <i>Beitr\xC3\xA4ge</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> or <i>Contributions</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn2\">  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> The phrase comes from Heidegger's famous interview with <i>Der Spiegel</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, first published in 1976 but from 1966. \"<i>Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten</i></span><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\", Der Spiegel, 31 May 1976.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  <div style=\"\" id=\"edn3\">  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang=\"EN-AU\"> See William J.
