content: "<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Any discussion of the Derveni Papyrus (DP) ought to begin by relating how a carbonized scroll was discovered in 1962, in the remains of a funeral pyre covering one grave (Grave A) of seven burials found during construction work on the National Road from Thessaloniki to Kavala.<span style=\"\">  </span>That is exactly how G\xC3\xA1bor Betegh begins his study.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Derveni Papyrus, tentatively dated to the late fourth or early third centuries BCE, was the first papyrus discovered on mainland Greece and is, perhaps, the oldest Greek papyrus so far discovered.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>The DP has been opened (an undertaking of delicacy, given the fragility of carbonized papyrus).<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>Twenty-two columns were reconstructed, with a remainder of some unidentified fragments.<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh tells us that </p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">The bottom part of the papyrus was consumed by the flames, and only 7-8 cm of the upper half escaped.<span style=\"\">  </span>This means that we have 15-17 lines of writing in the better preserved columns, of which the upper 10-11 lines have an almost continuous text, whereas usually only a few letters are legible in the bottom lines.<span style=\"\">  </span>Only small fragments of 9-10 lines, some with hardly any legible letters, remain from the badly damaged first columns. (p. 60)<span style=\"\">  </span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The papyrus contains an allegorized and rationalistic explication of an Orphic poem, preserving a treatise that is probably from the last quarter of the fifth century.<span style=\"\">  </span>Its author quotes Heraclitus (quoting together two lines that had not previously been known to go together), knows the theories of Anaxagoras, and seems familiar with the views of Diogenes of Apollonia.<span style=\"\">  </span>The find is spectacular.<span style=\"\">  </span>The story of the Derveni Papyrus involves archeologists, papyrologists, officials of government departments, classicists, and philosophers.<span style=\"\">  </span>More than forty years after its discovery, there has still been no official publication of the text, although that now is long overdue.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>An unauthorized and anonymous publication appeared in <i>Zeitschrift f\xC3\xBCr Papyrologie und Epigraphik</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (</span><i>ZPE</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) 47 (1982).<span style=\"\">  </span>A provisional text, including previously unavailable material, approved by Professor K. Tsantsanoglou, who was doing official work on the papyrus, was part of </span><i>Studies on the Derveni Papyrus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, edited by Andr\xC3\xA9 Laks and Glenn Most (Oxford University Press, 1997); and Richard Janko, working from, in Janko's words, \"all available published sources,\" published his own version, \"An Interim Text,\" in </span><i>ZPE</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 141 in 2002.<span style=\"\">  </span>Scholars disagree about the date of the papyrus, its significance, its likely author, and above all, about the text.<span style=\"\">  </span></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">I begin with this story, because, for many philosophers, textual uncertainties can be side issues, arcane difficulties that obscure the real task at hand of analyzing and solving philosophical <i>problems</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.<span style=\"\">  </span>Those of us who deal with the history of philosophy are more aware of the relevance of texts and manuscripts (and those working on Greek, Islamic, and Medieval philosophy are quite mindful of the problems).<span style=\"\">  </span>But our students often have no cognizance of this and some are puzzled about why Plato wrote dialogues and Aristotle wrote treatises, while the Presocratics and many Hellenistic philosophers wrote \"fragments.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>The story of the Derveni Papyrus reminds us how fragile our connection with the texts of past philosophers can be, and how sometimes what we study depends on the vicissitudes of history.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">While Presocratic philosophy was developing, the term \"Orphic\" came to be applied to a number of religious cults and rituals.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is probable that there was some sort of organized system of beliefs this early, although the evidence is spotty.<span style=\"\">  </span>Nonetheless, the name of Orpheus was certainly linked with views about the proper ways of life and death: there were views about purity of life, death rituals, and the immortality of the soul.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Orphic view was based on a cosmogony similar to that found in Hesiod, and Dionysus held a special place.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[5]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>In the extant and legible portions of the DP, a version of the cosmogony is given: there are a series of overthrowings of the ruling figure (Kronos overthrows Ouranos, probably by castrating him).<span style=\"\">  </span>Zeus follows Kronos and swallows the severed phallus, thus containing all things within himself.<span style=\"\">  </span>A new order arises from Zeus, who then apparently commits incest with Rhea (his mother); after the point where the papyrus breaks off, there were probably discussions of the births of Persephone (probably the child of Zeus and Rhea) and Dionysus (the child of Persephone and Zeus).<span style=\"\">  </span>The connection between the cosmogony and the rituals is unclear, but that is not our worry.<span style=\"\">  </span>It would appear that the Orphic view of the world is utterly incompatible with the philosophical, if by that we mean the attempt to understand the world of nature on its own terms (a standard view of the Presocratic philosophers, for instance).<span style=\"\">  </span>Yet the Derveni author sees links, and thinks that it is crucially important to give an allegorized account of the Orphic material.<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh gives a clear analysis of the cosmogony as it appears in the DP and undertakes an account of the Derveni author's purposes.</p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Betegh's admirable book begins with a provisional text (with a complete and scrupulous apparatus, recording alternate readings and conjectures for almost every line) and translation.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[6]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>There follow chapters on the finding of the papyrus and on the first six columns (which were not included in the anonymous ZPE text of 1982, being first made public by Professor Tsantsanoglou at the 1993 Laks-Most conference that forms the basis of their <i>Studies on the Derveni Papyrus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">).<span style=\"\">  </span>In two more chapters Betegh reconstructs the poem and discusses problems in interpreting both the Orphic text and the Derveni author's own purposes in providing an allegorized analysis of the original Orphic material.<span style=\"\">  </span>There are chapters on the cosmic god of the poem, on the cosmology of the poem, on Anaxagoras and the Derveni material, on Diogenes of Apollonia and Archelaus (said to be a student of Anaxagoras and a teacher of Socrates).<span style=\"\">  </span>There follows a curious discussion of Heraclitus combined with some rather speculative discussions of material from some Orphic gold plates.<span style=\"\">  </span>The fine final chapter, in which Betegh sums up and forms his conclusions, is called \"Understanding Orpheus, Understanding the World.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Finally, there is an appendix in which Betegh discusses and ultimately rejects Richard Janko's proposal that the author of the papyrus is the Sophist Diagoras of Melos, and that the papyrus contains a portion of Diagoras' </span><i>Apopyrgizontes Logoi</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[7]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span></span><i>The Derveni Papyrus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is a impressive display of scholarship, technical expertise, and philosophical judgment.<span style=\"\">  </span>Because I am a philosopher (and not a papyrologist), and because the readers of </span><i>NDPR</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> are also, for the most part, philosophers, I shall here concentrate on the parts of Betegh's work that most concern us.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Orphic material is, to modern eyes, bizarre; the allegorizing explanations only slightly less so.<span style=\"\">  </span>So the obvious question is: why did the Derveni Author explicate this material in this way?<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[8]</span></span></a></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Betegh suggests that the Derveni author sees a link between cosmology and eschatology.<span style=\"\">  </span>Proper understanding leads to proper conduct.<span style=\"\">  </span>The lines of column 5 point to this: </p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">Overcome by fault and by pleasure as well, they neither learn, nor believe.<span style=\"\">  </span>Disbelief and lack of understanding [?are the same thing].<span style=\"\">  </span>For if they neither understand, nor do they learn, [it is not possible that they believe] even when they see . . .<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[9]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Betegh explicates, </p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">Moral betterment is a precondition both for piety and gain in knowledge about the divine.<span style=\"\">  </span>This assertion . . . can be taken as an intellectualised interpretation of the need for purification before initiation . . . as one gains knowledge about the divine, that is, as one understands the way the divinity governs the world, and hence takes up the correct cognitive attitude towards it, one naturally, by the same gesture, assumes faith in it as well.<span style=\"\">  </span>Piety and comprehension of the nature and functioning of the god are two aspects of the same state of mind.<span style=\"\">  </span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The Derveni author thus carefully explicates the Orphic cosmogony and explains the details of ritual.<span style=\"\">  </span>This view of the relation between understanding and religious piety is not peculiar to the Derveni author.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is present in Xenophanes, and in Heraclitus.<span style=\"\">  </span>But it might seem that in the case of these Presocratics there is an important difference.<span style=\"\">  </span>In Xenophanes and Heraclitus, incomplete understanding of the nature of the gods and the cosmos leads to impious acts (or useless ones, especially in the case of Xenophanes).<span style=\"\">  </span>In Heraclitus, sound thinking is the greatest virtue (DK 22 B112), and he criticizes conventional religious practices insofar as those practices are based on wrongful understanding (B5, B14, and B15).<span style=\"\">  </span>For Xenophanes, failure to understand the true nature of divinity leads humans to imagine that gods are like themselves and that natural phenomena (like the rainbow or St. Elmo's fire) are really messages, signs, and portents sent from the deity to humans (DK 21 B32, A39).<span style=\"\">  </span>In these cases, there appears to be a reduction of the divine to the naturalistic.<span style=\"\">  </span>Iris rainbow, the messenger of the gods, is really by nature cloud, says Xenophanes.<span style=\"\">  </span>For Heraclitus, the ruler of the universe is the <i>Logos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, whose symbol is fire or thunderbolt (DK 22 B30, B64, B90); it is, says Heraclitus, both unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus (B32).<span style=\"\">  </span>The Derveni author, on the other hand, interprets the Orphic stories as advocating for certain religious views and practices: Betegh says \"the most probable general characterization of the author . . . is that he was a priestly figure with Orphic allegiance\" (p. 350).<span style=\"\">  </span>For Betegh, this priestly figure, like an ancient doctor, is demonstrating his presumed superior knowledge (both theoretical and craft-knowledge) through his explanations.<span style=\"\">  </span>For, like the medical practitioner, the Derveni author wants to heal us: as a priestly figure, he wants to gain the trust of his religious \"patients\" and encourage them to act in certain ways for the health of their souls rather than of their bodies.<span style=\"\">  </span>Thus, for him, the divine cannot simply </span><i>reduce</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to the natural, but rather, the workings of the divine must be </span><i>present</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> in the natural.<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh argues that the Derveni author is well-versed in the cosmological theories of the Presocratics, and is trying to be up to date in his views (p. 239, with respect to the cosmological picture in the DP).<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[10]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>So, is the Derveni author trying to harmonize the new philosophy with the Orphic tenets, or is he trying to make Orphism respectable for people who are inclined to reject it as insufficiently rational?<span style=\"\">  </span></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Almost as soon as word of the contents of the papyrus was out, it seemed to scholars that Anaxagoras must have been a fundamental influence on the views of the Derveni author.<span style=\"\">  </span>The god of the papyrus is identified with Mind (or <i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">); Anaxagoras' </span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is the motive cause of the cosmos.<span style=\"\">  </span>Some other scholars have also seen Anaxagorean influence in the \"theory of matter\" at work in the DP. <span style=\"\"> </span>Betegh, reasonably, in my view, offers a deflationary analysis of this latter claim.<span style=\"\">  </span>Anaxagoras' theory is far more complex and sophisticated than that of the DP, and there is no need for the Derveni author to invoke a system as complicated as Anaxagoras' theory of \"all things in all things.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>On the other hand, the connection with Anaxagorean </span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> seems far more likely.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Derveni author calls his god </span><i>Mind</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> precisely </span><i>because</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> it is an intelligent cause, and Betegh argues that this name did not come from the original Orphic poem, but was introduced by the Derveni author himself.<span style=\"\">  </span>Anaxagoras' </span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is certainly a first efficient cause, acting on the eternal undifferentiated mass of stuffs that form the original mixture.<span style=\"\">  </span></span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> sets this mass in motion, and it is from the resulting rotation that the world as we perceive it developed (DK 58 B1, B12).<span style=\"\">  </span>One can immediately see that this would be an attractive model for a theorist with a god-driven cosmos.<span style=\"\">  </span>Yet, as both Plato's Socrates (in the </span><i>Phaedo</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) and Aristotle argued, it is not clear that Anaxagoras' </span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is anything more than an efficient cause; it does not, later Greek philosophers argued, decide anything, and acts more like a motor than a rational mind.<span style=\"\">  </span>Diogenes of Apollonia, another obvious influence on the Derveni author, said that air, as having intelligence (</span><i>no\xC4\x93sis</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">), governs all things and is god; it has been argued, by Laks, that this change in nomenclature constitutes exactly this criticism of Anaxagoras by Diogenes.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn11\" name=\"_ednref11\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[11]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>Moreover, Anaxagoras had a reputation as an atheist, and was tried and banished by the Athenians for impiety (because, according to reports, he said that the moon was a stone and the sun a mass of red-hot metal).<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh, of course, is aware of all this, and indeed discusses some of these points.<span style=\"\">  </span>So, if Betegh wants to maintain the priestly-philosopher account of the Derveni author, he has to find a way to reconcile the author's adoption of the language of Anaxagorean naturalism with his Orphic piety.<span style=\"\">  </span>He finds a model for the link in Heraclitus, which he explores in a key chapter: \"Physics and eschatology: Heraclitus and the gold plates.\"</span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Because the Derveni author quotes Heraclitus (col. 4 contains B3 and B94, quoted as a single unit), and because only Heraclitus is mentioned by name by the author, it is clear that Heraclitus has some importance for our understanding of the papyrus.<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh goes farther, finding in the Heraclitus quotation a model of the connection between cosmology and eschatology that the author is making throughout the papyrus.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Heraclitus quotation says, \"The sun . . . according to nature is a human foot in width, not transgressing its boundaries.<span style=\"\">  </span>If . . . oversteps, the Erinyes, the guardians of Justice, will find it out\" (Betegh's translation).<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn12\" name=\"_ednref12\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[12]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>As Betegh notes, the problem in forging such a link is that the papyrus, in its fragmentary state, reveals little about the author's eschatological views.<span style=\"\">  </span>Following Glenn Most, Betegh argues that these views can be reconstructed (at least in part) by looking at the gold plates (especially the so-called Tablet C and A4) from burials in Thurii (in southern Italy) that have Orphic connections.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn13\" name=\"_ednref13\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[13]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>The intelligible words (not many) on Tablet C (found in the tomb of a cremated person) connect fire and air, and also use several of the names for divine personages found in the DP.<span style=\"\">  </span>That C and A4 were together links them, according to Betegh, with the other so-called A plates from Thurii, which apparently discuss a death by lightning.<span style=\"\">  </span>This, of course, is the thunderbolt of Zeus, and connects with fire and the <i>Logos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> in Heraclitus.<span style=\"\">  </span>According to Betegh, relying on the suggestions he finds in the gold plates, the Derveni author seeks to correct Heraclitus' view.<span style=\"\">  </span>For Heraclitus in the passage quoted,</span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">cosmic and eschatological guidance, justice and surveillance are closely related or even identical functions of the supreme power, fire. . . the Derveni author would agree with much of this -- except that last word, fire. . . <i>Pace</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> Heraclitus it is not the thunderbolt which steers the world, but Zeus, and the thunderbolt is but a tool in his hand. (p. 345)<span style=\"\">  </span></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">All fire is thus divine and not something for the initiated to fear.<span style=\"\">  </span>The papyrus claims that the stars and other heavenly bodies are fire -- but controlled by Mind (Zeus) they are part of the natural order, necessary for the continued existence of world, and \"the source of all becoming.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>It is the tool of the divine and not to be feared in any form, not even as the fire that burns the funeral pyre at the end of one's life.<span style=\"\">  </span>For the initiate, the natural explanation and the eschatology coincide.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is a fascinating suggestion, yet I find it rather fantastic.<span style=\"\">  </span>(Betegh recognizes that it is highly conjectural.)<span style=\"\">  </span>The geographical distance between Thurii and Derveni is large, and connections between the pieces of evidence are slight, and Betegh's interpretation requires that the Derveni author quote Heraclitus (and only Heraclitus) and at the same time intimate that Heraclitus fails to understand Heraclitus' own views (it is Zeus -- air, and his minions, the Erinyes, who control the sun -- rather than the fire in the sun that is divine).<span style=\"\">  </span>In effect, for Betegh, the Derveni author turns Heraclitus on his head, yet quotes him in a way that suggests that what Heraclitus has to say is crucial.<span style=\"\">  </span>Moreover, just before the quotation, the author refers explicitly to Heraclitus' doctrine that the common (by which Heraclitus means the objective truth of the<i> Logos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) overturns what is private, the individual beliefs of those who do not recognize the cosmic order embodied in the </span><i>Logos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (see Heraclitus B1, B2).<span style=\"\">  </span>This, too, must be important, yet it is unclear how this coheres with Betegh's story, for it seems to point away from eschatology toward the objective knowledge of physics and philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">There is another, more straightforward way to connect physics and eschatology.<span style=\"\">  </span>I find it curious that Betegh devotes so little space to Empedocles.<span style=\"\">  </span>(There is a short discussion on pp. 370-372, at the very end of the last chapter.)<span style=\"\">  </span>In Empedocles we find exactly the sorts of connections that Betegh needs for his interpretation of the Derveni author's intentions.<span style=\"\">  </span>The new Strasbourg Empedocles material refutes the traditional view that Empedocles wrote a physical poem and a religious poem that have little to do with one another.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn14\" name=\"_ednref14\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[14]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>For Empedocles, genuine knowledge of cosmology is necessary for proper religious belief: knowledge is the key to understanding the Divine and living correctly through all the returns of one's daimon.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn15\" name=\"_ednref15\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[15]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>Whether or not Betegh is willing to accept Empedocles as a model for the Derveni author, it is curious that he dismisses him so quickly.<span style=\"\">  </span>He acknowledges Orphic strains in Empedocles, but tries to sever the connection between Empedocles and the Derveni author by emphasizing (correctly) that Empedocles sets himself up as an authority, taking for himself the primary role that Orpheus plays in the DP.<span style=\"\">  </span>In contrast, the Derveni author recognizes the authority of Orpheus, and presents himself as merely the servant and prophet of Orpheus.<span style=\"\">  </span>Yet even with this difference, I find Empedocles a compelling possible influence -- seeing positive doctrinal connections with Betegh's Derveni author that are at least as strong as those that link him with Diogenes of Apollonia.<span style=\"\">  </span>The \"atheist\" Anaxagoras may have provided <i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, but Empedocles may have provided the link between physics and eschatology.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn16\" name=\"_ednref16\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[16]</span></span></a> </span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">However we evaluate the conclusions that Betegh finally draws, this is a valuable and important book.<span style=\"\">  </span>There is much here for philosophers to learn -- about Greek religion, about papyrus studies, and above all, about the porous boundaries between what we would call philosophy and theology, or science, or superstition, in the world of the ancient Greeks.<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh's study is a large step forward, a step that he takes with caution, recognizing that once the DP is officially published, some of his results may have to be revised.<span style=\"\">  </span>In the meantime, we should be grateful that he has undertaken this bold study exploring the wonders and mysteries of a remarkable document.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn17\" name=\"_ednref17\"

(p. 60)<span style=\"\">  </span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The papyrus contains an allegorized and rationalistic explication of an Orphic poem, preserving a treatise that is probably from the last quarter of the fifth century.<span style=\"\">  </span>Its author quotes Heraclitus (quoting together two lines that had not previously been known to go together), knows the theories of Anaxagoras, and seems familiar with the views of Diogenes of Apollonia.<span style=\"\">  </span>The find is spectacular.<span style=\"\">  </span>The story of the Derveni Papyrus involves archeologists, papyrologists, officials of government departments, classicists, and philosophers.<span style=\"\">  </span>More than forty years after its discovery, there has still been no official publication of the text, although that now is long overdue.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>An unauthorized and anonymous publication appeared in <i>Zeitschrift f\xC3\xBCr Papyrologie und Epigraphik</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (</span><i>ZPE</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) 47 (1982).<span style=\"\">  </span>A provisional text, including previously unavailable material, approved by Professor K.

after the point where the papyrus breaks off, there were probably discussions of the births of Persephone (probably the child of Zeus and Rhea) and Dionysus (the child of Persephone and Zeus).<span style=\"\">  </span>The connection between the cosmogony and the rituals is unclear, but that is not our worry.<span style=\"\">  </span>It would appear that the Orphic view of the world is utterly incompatible with the philosophical, if by that we mean the attempt to understand the world of nature on its own terms (a standard view of the Presocratic philosophers, for instance).<span style=\"\">  </span>Yet the Derveni author sees links, and thinks that it is crucially important to give an allegorized account of the Orphic material.<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh gives a clear analysis of the cosmogony as it appears in the DP and undertakes an account of the Derveni author's purposes.</p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Betegh's admirable book begins with a provisional text (with a complete and scrupulous apparatus, recording alternate readings and conjectures for almost every line) and translation.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[6]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>There follow chapters on the finding of the papyrus and on the first six columns (which were not included in the anonymous ZPE text of 1982, being first made public by Professor Tsantsanoglou at the 1993 Laks-Most conference that forms the basis of their <i>Studies on the Derveni Papyrus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">).<span style=\"\">  </span>In two more chapters Betegh reconstructs the poem and discusses problems in interpreting both the Orphic text and the Derveni author's own purposes in providing an allegorized analysis of the original Orphic material.<span style=\"\">  </span>There are chapters on the cosmic god of the poem, on the cosmology of the poem, on Anaxagoras and the Derveni material, on Diogenes of Apollonia and Archelaus (said to be a student of Anaxagoras and a teacher of Socrates).<span style=\"\">  </span>There follows a curious discussion of Heraclitus combined with some rather speculative discussions of material from some Orphic gold plates.<span style=\"\">  </span>The fine final chapter, in which Betegh sums up and forms his conclusions, is called \"Understanding Orpheus, Understanding the World.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Finally, there is an appendix in which Betegh discusses and ultimately rejects Richard Janko's proposal that the author of the papyrus is the Sophist Diagoras of Melos, and that the papyrus contains a portion of Diagoras' </span><i>Apopyrgizontes Logoi</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[7]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span></span><i>The Derveni Papyrus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is a impressive display of scholarship, technical expertise, and philosophical judgment.<span style=\"\">  </span>Because I am a philosopher (and not a papyrologist), and because the readers of </span><i>NDPR</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> are also, for the most part, philosophers, I shall here concentrate on the parts of Betegh's work that most concern us.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Orphic material is, to modern eyes, bizarre; the allegorizing explanations only slightly less so.<span style=\"\">  </span>So the obvious question is: why did the Derveni Author explicate this material in this way?<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[8]</span></span></a></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Betegh suggests that the Derveni author sees a link between cosmology and eschatology.<span style=\"\">  </span>Proper understanding leads to proper conduct.<span style=\"\">  </span>The lines of column 5 point to this: </p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">Overcome by fault and by pleasure as well, they neither learn, nor believe.<span style=\"\">  </span>Disbelief and lack of understanding [?are the same thing].<span style=\"\">  </span>For if they neither understand, nor do they learn, [it is not possible that they believe] even when they see . . .<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[9]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Betegh explicates, </p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">Moral betterment is a precondition both for piety and gain in knowledge about the divine.<span style=\"\">  </span>This assertion . . . can be taken as an intellectualised interpretation of the need for purification before initiation . . . as one gains knowledge about the divine, that is, as one understands the way the divinity governs the world, and hence takes up the correct cognitive attitude towards it, one naturally, by the same gesture, assumes faith in it as well.<span style=\"\">  </span>Piety and comprehension of the nature and functioning of the god are two aspects of the same state of mind.<span style=\"\">  </span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The Derveni author thus carefully explicates the Orphic cosmogony and explains the details of ritual.<span style=\"\">  </span>This view of the relation between understanding and religious piety is not peculiar to the Derveni author.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is present in Xenophanes, and in Heraclitus.<span style=\"\">  </span>But it might seem that in the case of these Presocratics there is an important difference.<span style=\"\">  </span>In Xenophanes and Heraclitus, incomplete understanding of the nature of the gods and the cosmos leads to impious acts (or useless ones, especially in the case of Xenophanes).<span style=\"\">  </span>In Heraclitus, sound thinking is the greatest virtue (DK 22 B112), and he criticizes conventional religious practices insofar as those practices are based on wrongful understanding (B5, B14, and B15).<span style=\"\">  </span>For Xenophanes, failure to understand the true nature of divinity leads humans to imagine that gods are like themselves and that natural phenomena (like the rainbow or St. Elmo's fire) are really messages, signs, and portents sent from the deity to humans (DK 21 B32, A39).<span style=\"\">  </span>In these cases, there appears to be a reduction of the divine to the naturalistic.<span style=\"\">  </span>Iris rainbow, the messenger of the gods, is really by nature cloud, says Xenophanes.<span style=\"\">  </span>For Heraclitus, the ruler of the universe is the <i>Logos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, whose symbol is fire or thunderbolt (DK 22 B30, B64, B90); it is, says Heraclitus, both unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus (B32).<span style=\"\">  </span>The Derveni author, on the other hand, interprets the Orphic stories as advocating for certain religious views and practices: Betegh says \"the most probable general characterization of the author . . . is that he was a priestly figure with Orphic allegiance\" (p. 350).<span style=\"\">  </span>For Betegh, this priestly figure, like an ancient doctor, is demonstrating his presumed superior knowledge (both theoretical and craft-knowledge) through his explanations.<span style=\"\">  </span>For, like the medical practitioner, the Derveni author wants to heal us: as a priestly figure, he wants to gain the trust of his religious \"patients\" and encourage them to act in certain ways for the health of their souls rather than of their bodies.<span style=\"\">  </span>Thus, for him, the divine cannot simply </span><i>reduce</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to the natural, but rather, the workings of the divine must be </span><i>present</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> in the natural.<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh argues that the Derveni author is well-versed in the cosmological theories of the Presocratics, and is trying to be up to date in his views (p. 239, with respect to the cosmological picture in the DP).<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[10]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>So, is the Derveni author trying to harmonize the new philosophy with the Orphic tenets, or is he trying to make Orphism respectable for people who are inclined to reject it as insufficiently rational?<span style=\"\">  </span></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Almost as soon as word of the contents of the papyrus was out, it seemed to scholars that Anaxagoras must have been a fundamental influence on the views of the Derveni author.<span style=\"\">  </span>The god of the papyrus is identified with Mind (or <i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">); Anaxagoras' </span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is the motive cause of the cosmos.<span style=\"\">  </span>Some other scholars have also seen Anaxagorean influence in the \"theory of matter\" at work in the DP. <span style=\"\"> </span>Betegh, reasonably, in my view, offers a deflationary analysis of this latter claim.<span style=\"\">  </span>Anaxagoras' theory is far more complex and sophisticated than that of the DP, and there is no need for the Derveni author to invoke a system as complicated as Anaxagoras' theory of \"all things in all things.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>On the other hand, the connection with Anaxagorean </span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> seems far more likely.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Derveni author calls his god </span><i>Mind</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> precisely </span><i>because</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> it is an intelligent cause, and Betegh argues that this name did not come from the original Orphic poem, but was introduced by the Derveni author himself.<span style=\"\">  </span>Anaxagoras' </span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is certainly a first efficient cause, acting on the eternal undifferentiated mass of stuffs that form the original mixture.<span style=\"\">  </span></span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> sets this mass in motion, and it is from the resulting rotation that the world as we perceive it developed (DK 58 B1, B12).<span style=\"\">  </span>One can immediately see that this would be an attractive model for a theorist with a god-driven cosmos.<span style=\"\">  </span>Yet, as both Plato's Socrates (in the </span><i>Phaedo</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) and Aristotle argued, it is not clear that Anaxagoras' </span><i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is anything more than an efficient cause; it does not, later Greek philosophers argued, decide anything, and acts more like a motor than a rational mind.<span style=\"\">  </span>Diogenes of Apollonia, another obvious influence on the Derveni author, said that air, as having intelligence (</span><i>no\xC4\x93sis</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">), governs all things and is god; it has been argued, by Laks, that this change in nomenclature constitutes exactly this criticism of Anaxagoras by Diogenes.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn11\" name=\"_ednref11\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[11]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>Moreover, Anaxagoras had a reputation as an atheist, and was tried and banished by the Athenians for impiety (because, according to reports, he said that the moon was a stone and the sun a mass of red-hot metal).<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh, of course, is aware of all this, and indeed discusses some of these points.<span style=\"\">  </span>So, if Betegh wants to maintain the priestly-philosopher account of the Derveni author, he has to find a way to reconcile the author's adoption of the language of Anaxagorean naturalism with his Orphic piety.<span style=\"\">  </span>He finds a model for the link in Heraclitus, which he explores in a key chapter: \"Physics and eschatology: Heraclitus and the gold plates.\"</span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Because the Derveni author quotes Heraclitus (col. 4 contains B3 and B94, quoted as a single unit), and because only Heraclitus is mentioned by name by the author, it is clear that Heraclitus has some importance for our understanding of the papyrus.<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh goes farther, finding in the Heraclitus quotation a model of the connection between cosmology and eschatology that the author is making throughout the papyrus.<span style=\"\">  </span>The Heraclitus quotation says, \"The sun . . . according to nature is a human foot in width, not transgressing its boundaries.<span style=\"\">  </span>If . . . oversteps, the Erinyes, the guardians of Justice, will find it out\" (Betegh's translation).<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn12\" name=\"_ednref12\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[12]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>As Betegh notes, the problem in forging such a link is that the papyrus, in its fragmentary state, reveals little about the author's eschatological views.<span style=\"\">  </span>Following Glenn Most, Betegh argues that these views can be reconstructed (at least in part) by looking at the gold plates (especially the so-called Tablet C and A4) from burials in Thurii (in southern Italy) that have Orphic connections.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn13\" name=\"_ednref13\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[13]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>The intelligible words (not many) on Tablet C (found in the tomb of a cremated person) connect fire and air, and also use several of the names for divine personages found in the DP.<span style=\"\">  </span>That C and A4 were together links them, according to Betegh, with the other so-called A plates from Thurii, which apparently discuss a death by lightning.<span style=\"\">  </span>This, of course, is the thunderbolt of Zeus, and connects with fire and the <i>Logos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> in Heraclitus.<span style=\"\">  </span>According to Betegh, relying on the suggestions he finds in the gold plates, the Derveni author seeks to correct Heraclitus' view.<span style=\"\">  </span>For Heraclitus in the passage quoted,</span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">cosmic and eschatological guidance, justice and surveillance are closely related or even identical functions of the supreme power, fire. . . the Derveni author would agree with much of this -- except that last word, fire. . . <i>Pace</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> Heraclitus it is not the thunderbolt which steers the world, but Zeus, and the thunderbolt is but a tool in his hand. (p. 345)<span style=\"\">  </span></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">All fire is thus divine and not something for the initiated to fear.<span style=\"\">  </span>The papyrus claims that the stars and other heavenly bodies are fire -- but controlled by Mind (Zeus) they are part of the natural order, necessary for the continued existence of world, and \"the source of all becoming.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>It is the tool of the divine and not to be feared in any form, not even as the fire that burns the funeral pyre at the end of one's life.<span style=\"\">  </span>For the initiate, the natural explanation and the eschatology coincide.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is a fascinating suggestion, yet I find it rather fantastic.<span style=\"\">  </span>(Betegh recognizes that it is highly conjectural.)<span style=\"\">  </span>The geographical distance between Thurii and Derveni is large, and connections between the pieces of evidence are slight, and Betegh's interpretation requires that the Derveni author quote Heraclitus (and only Heraclitus) and at the same time intimate that Heraclitus fails to understand Heraclitus' own views (it is Zeus -- air, and his minions, the Erinyes, who control the sun -- rather than the fire in the sun that is divine).<span style=\"\">  </span>In effect, for Betegh, the Derveni author turns Heraclitus on his head, yet quotes him in a way that suggests that what Heraclitus has to say is crucial.<span style=\"\">  </span>Moreover, just before the quotation, the author refers explicitly to Heraclitus' doctrine that the common (by which Heraclitus means the objective truth of the<i> Logos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) overturns what is private, the individual beliefs of those who do not recognize the cosmic order embodied in the </span><i>Logos</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (see Heraclitus B1, B2).<span style=\"\">  </span>This, too, must be important, yet it is unclear how this coheres with Betegh's story, for it seems to point away from eschatology toward the objective knowledge of physics and philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span></span></p>  <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">There is another, more straightforward way to connect physics and eschatology.<span style=\"\">  </span>I find it curious that Betegh devotes so little space to Empedocles.<span style=\"\">  </span>(There is a short discussion on pp. 370-372, at the very end of the last chapter.)<span style=\"\">  </span>In Empedocles we find exactly the sorts of connections that Betegh needs for his interpretation of the Derveni author's intentions.<span style=\"\">  </span>The new Strasbourg Empedocles material refutes the traditional view that Empedocles wrote a physical poem and a religious poem that have little to do with one another.<a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn14\" name=\"_ednref14\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[14]</span></span></a><span style=\"\">  </span>For Empedocles, genuine

Empedocles as a model for the Derveni author, it is curious that he dismisses him so quickly.<span style=\"\">  </span>He acknowledges Orphic strains in Empedocles, but tries to sever the connection between Empedocles and the Derveni author by emphasizing (correctly) that Empedocles sets himself up as an authority, taking for himself the primary role that Orpheus plays in the DP.<span style=\"\">  </span>In contrast, the Derveni author recognizes the authority of Orpheus, and presents himself as merely the servant and prophet of Orpheus.<span style=\"\">  </span>Yet even with this difference, I find Empedocles a compelling possible influence -- seeing positive doctrinal connections with Betegh's Derveni author that are at least as strong as those that link him with Diogenes of Apollonia.<span style=\"\">  </span>The \"atheist\" Anaxagoras may have provided <i>Nous</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, but Empedocles may have provided the link between physics and

studies, and above all, about the porous boundaries between what we would call philosophy and theology, or science, or superstition, in the world of the ancient Greeks.<span style=\"\">  </span>Betegh's study is a large step forward, a step that he takes with caution, recognizing that once the DP is officially published, some of his results may have to be revised.<span style=\"\">
