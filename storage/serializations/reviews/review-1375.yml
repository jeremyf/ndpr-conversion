content: "<p>Gasch\xC3\xA9 offers here a comprehensive discussion of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics in the <i>Critique of Judgment</i>, tracing Kant\xE2\x80\x99s account as it unfolds from the placement of pure judgments of taste within the general doctrine of reflective judgment in the published and unpublished introductions to the <i>CJ</i>, through the characterizations of judgments of taste and of sublimity, to the claim that beauty is the \xE2\x80\x9Csymbol of morality,\xE2\x80\x9D with which the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment concludes. His discussion focuses, however, on the two themes announced in his title: Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetic formalism and (via the technical meaning of \xE2\x80\x9Cidea\xE2\x80\x9D) the \xE2\x80\x9Ccrucial role played by reason in the formation and judgment of form\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 12).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Gasch\xC3\xA9 argues that one ought to read Kant\xE2\x80\x99s formalism not as a claim that in a pure judgment of taste we appreciate \xE2\x80\x9Csurface\xE2\x80\x9D characteristics of an object such as line or composition, but as the claim that in aesthetic judging we apprehend the \xE2\x80\x9Cmere form of an object\xE2\x80\x9D as such, as \xE2\x80\x9Cminimally cognizable.\xE2\x80\x9D Following B\xC3\xA9atrice Longuenesse, Gasch\xC3\xA9 argues that our apprehension of such form is an act of \xE2\x80\x9Cmere\xE2\x80\x9D reflection \xE2\x80\x9Cisolated\xE2\x80\x9D from its role within our usual, \xE2\x80\x9Creflective but also determinative,\xE2\x80\x9D conceptually guided acts of judgment that render objects and experience possible. The (successful) engagement in such \xE2\x80\x9Cmere\xE2\x80\x9D reflection is pleasurable, for it is a \xE2\x80\x9Cprecognitive\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cpara-epistemic\xE2\x80\x9D achievement that renders \xE2\x80\x9Cwild,\xE2\x80\x9D unconceptualized objects \xE2\x80\x9Cminimally\xE2\x80\x9D comprehensible.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s treatment of the role of reason in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics touches on many of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s suggestions concerning the relationship between aesthetics and morality (or practical reason). More controversially, drawing upon Kant\xE2\x80\x99s infrequently discussed account of the \xE2\x80\x9CIdeal of Beauty\xE2\x80\x9D in paragraph 17 and upon that of aesthetic ideas in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s account of fine art, Gasch\xC3\xA9 argues that the \xE2\x80\x9Cpara-epistemic\xE2\x80\x9D apprehension of form in aesthetic judgment is, itself, already guided by and directed towards reason\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cidea of a maximum\xE2\x80\x9D and our rational aims to cognize particular objects, or nature, as systematic wholes. The \xE2\x80\x9Cprodigality\xE2\x80\x9D of beautiful form, the \xE2\x80\x9Cluxuriance\xE2\x80\x9D of the ideas produced by the imagination in aesthetic experience are symbolic emulations of rational totality and systematicity, just as in the experience of the (mathematical) sublime, on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s view, the imagination, in aiming to comprehend a large sensible object, aims also to represent sensibly the rational idea of infinity. Thus Gasch\xC3\xA9 draws unusually strong parallels between pure judgments of taste concerning natural beauty, judgments of art as expressing aesthetic ideas, and aesthetic judgments of the sublime: all of these judgments are apprehensions of the \xE2\x80\x9Cminimal cognizability\xE2\x80\x9D of \xE2\x80\x9Cwild\xE2\x80\x9D or unconceptualized objects and are experiences of the \xE2\x80\x9Clife of the mind,\xE2\x80\x9D oriented by and symbolic of the overarching aims of reason, and \xE2\x80\x9Cconducive,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cbeneficial\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cenlivening\xE2\x80\x9D to the exercise of our rational capacities as a whole.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This book contains a number of provocative suggestions, most prominently this last, that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s judgments of the beautiful and the sublime might both be read primarily as sensible symbolizations of rationality. Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s background in literary theory and criticism is demonstrated in interesting discussions of particular passages or locutions in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s text. For example, in Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s early essay, \xE2\x80\x9CHypotyposis\xE2\x80\x9D (reprinted in this volume), he suggests that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s denigration of rhetoric (in his hierarchical discussion of the fine arts) should be reinterpreted in light of his use of the classical rhetorical figure of \xE2\x80\x9Chypotyposis\xE2\x80\x9D to characterize beauty as a symbol of morality. And, drawing upon lexicographical research, he argues that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s usage of \xE2\x80\x9Cmere\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>bloss</i>) to qualify the a priori in the <i>CJ</i>, by contrast to \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>rein</i>) in the other two critiques, indicates the fragility and elusiveness of the a priori principle of reflection and of taste: \xE2\x80\x9Cmere\xE2\x80\x9D reflection does not generate a fixed, self-sufficient body of a priori knowledge (by contrast to the understanding\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D principles or the \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D principle of practical reason) but is identifiable only by contrast to what it \xE2\x80\x9Cexcludes,\xE2\x80\x9D that from which it is \xE2\x80\x9Cisolated\xE2\x80\x9D (determinate, empirical, contentful knowledge of objects). More broadly, though not \xE2\x80\x9Cthematized\xE2\x80\x9D by Gasch\xC3\xA9 as a tension, Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s characterization of the pure judgment of aesthetic form as both a \xE2\x80\x9Cminimal\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cprecognitive\xE2\x80\x9D grasp of the object and as a maximal grasp of the \xE2\x80\x9Cluxuriance\xE2\x80\x9D of an object\xE2\x80\x99s characteristics beyond (\xE2\x80\x9Cpara\xE2\x80\x9D) determinate cognition identifies an interesting, underdiscussed tension in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s description of our apprehension of beauty, and in its \xE2\x80\x9Csystematic\xE2\x80\x9D placement with respect to cognitive understanding, as both less and more than empirical knowledge.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Gasch\xC3\xA9 has, however, much more ambitious aims: he writes that he has sought \xE2\x80\x9Cto avoid . . . a critical debate with the various and often contradictory interpretations\xE2\x80\x9D of the <i>CJ</i> and promises that \xE2\x80\x9C[a]s a result of [his] reading, many of the so-called inconsistencies and puzzles that commentators have enjoyed pointing out . . . will appear . . . less problematic\xE2\x80\x9D; on his reading, Kant provides a \xE2\x80\x9Chighly consistent set of strong arguments\xE2\x80\x9D in the <i>CJ</i> (p. 11). And indeed, Gasch\xC3\xA9 cites very little Anglo-American or German scholarship; he does not even mention such prominent readers of this text as Cristel Fricke, Jens Kuhlenkampff, or Paul Guyer. Instead of scholarly debate, Gasch\xC3\xA9 writes in the style of some European commentary, using extensive, narrative paraphrase of the text, liberally interspersed with textual quotations. This style of commentary, at its best, can (re)orient the reader\xE2\x80\x99s sense of a text\xE2\x80\x99s structure and central concerns, as Gasch\xC3\xA9 does, in beginning his Critique of Aesthetic Judgment, with the \xE2\x80\x9Cthird moment\xE2\x80\x9D in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s account of the judgment of taste. On Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s reading, the justificatory questions concerning the universal yet subjective validity of the claims of taste posed in the first two moments (and ultimately addressed in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s deduction of judgments of taste) that preoccupy most commentators on the <i>CJ</i> \xE2\x80\x93and, arguably, Kant himself\xE2\x80\x94take second place to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s descriptive aesthetics of form and of \xE2\x80\x9Cboundless\xE2\x80\x9D formlessness (in the sublime) and to the systematic importance of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s identification of the \xE2\x80\x9Ctranscendental\xE2\x80\x9D status of taste.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Without further analysis and reconstruction, the paraphrastic form of commentary is, however, insufficient to clarify the frequently obscure and puzzling claims of the <i>CJ</i>, much less allay philosophical worries concerning the strength of the arguments there presented. For example, Gasch\xC3\xA9 suggests that on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s view we can and do judge works of art \xE2\x80\x93 as well as natural beauties \xE2\x80\x93 in \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D judgments of taste, on the basis of their \xE2\x80\x9Cmere form.\xE2\x80\x9D For, Gasch\xC3\xA9 argues, though we do judge these objects in terms of concepts (and thus would appear precisely not to be judging them in terms of Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cmere,\xE2\x80\x9D unconceptualized form), the concepts by which we judge art works have been \xE2\x80\x9Crendered indeterminate\xE2\x80\x9D by the genius, who transforms them into aesthetic ideas that contain \xE2\x80\x9Cmore\xE2\x80\x9D than can be determinately, conceptually articulated; thus, our appreciation of such ideas is identical (?) to our appreciation of the \xE2\x80\x9Cluxuriance\xE2\x80\x9D of natural beautiful form. Leaving aside difficulties (often discussed in the scholarship, but not mentioned here) concerning <i>which</i> kind of concept is employed, on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s view, in such judgments (representation? painting? post-Impressionist painting? sunflower, vase, or table? the vibrancy, terror, or fragility of life?), Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s elaboration of many different possible meanings of \xE2\x80\x9Cform\xE2\x80\x9D in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of the arts\xE2\x80\x94from \xE2\x80\x9Cacademic\xE2\x80\x9D form as necessary technique for artistic production (which, as Gasch\xC3\xA9 writes, is \xE2\x80\x9Cutterly distinct\xE2\x80\x9D from Kant\xE2\x80\x99s usage of \xE2\x80\x9Cform\xE2\x80\x9D elsewhere in the <i>CJ</i> [p. 189]), to an expression \xE2\x80\x9Cadequate\xE2\x80\x9D to the genius\xE2\x80\x99 thought (p. 190), to arrangement, composition or delineation (p. 192), to success at representation of a thing or the \xE2\x80\x9Cform of thing\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 193)\xE2\x80\x94does not persuade the reader that appreciation of aesthetic ideas or artistic beautiful form is similar to appreciation of natural form. This elaboration tends, rather, to render the Kantian concept of form itself\xE2\x80\x94already elusive in Kant, and on Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s presentation\xE2\x80\x94indeterminate.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>There are also terminological and textual imprecisions in Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s discussion that will irritate scholars and may frustrate or mislead students looking for elucidation of this difficult text. For example, in arguing (rightly) that natural, not artistic, beauty is central to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics, Gasch\xC3\xA9 repeatedly emphasizes Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claim that in order to be beautiful, art must look like nature, but usually fails to quote, and does not remark upon, Kant\xE2\x80\x99s appended claim that beautiful nature looks like art (<i>CJ</i> Ak. V: 306). Likewise, in discussing Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claims in the \xE2\x80\x9CIdeal of Beauty\xE2\x80\x9D that we must produce an ideal representation of reason\xE2\x80\x99s idea of a maximum as a standard for taste, Gasch\xC3\xA9 asserts that \xE2\x80\x9C[f]or the most part, Kant remains silent, in chapter 17, about how to conceive of such an ideal\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 106). This assertion is, at the least, highly puzzling, since Kant devotes most of paragraph 17 to arguing that the sole ideal of beauty is the representation of a (particular sort of) human form (a claim that Gasch\xC3\xA9 ducks, as requiring \xE2\x80\x9Cextensive discussion,\xE2\x80\x9D a page earlier). And, more centrally, in discussing the relationship between Kant\xE2\x80\x99s frequent denials in the <i>CJ</i> that the judgment of taste involves conceptual determination of objects, and his doctrines in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>\xE2\x80\x94how can Kant of all philosophers claim that we find objects (somehow) intelligible without any conceptualization?\xE2\x80\x94 Gasch\xC3\xA9 suggests that aesthetic experience concerns objects characterized indeed by the a priori \xE2\x80\x9Cform of a phenomenon\xE2\x80\x9D promulgated in the <i>CPR</i>, for which, however, we lack <i>empirical</i> concepts (pp. 72-3). But Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s glosses here (and throughout the book) -- \xE2\x80\x9Ca reflective aesthetic judgment takes place in the absence of any concept that would unify . . . the . . . manifold . . . before all logical determination, before all representation through which the object is thought\xE2\x80\x9D [my emphasis]\xE2\x80\x94are imprecise, given that the \xE2\x80\x9Cform of phenomena\xE2\x80\x9D of the <i>CPR</i> is, of course, conceptually determined by the categories. (It is also not helpful to most current readers of the <i>CJ</i> that Gasch\xC3\xA9 cites page numbers not from the Akademie edition, but from an old translation [Bernard], which makes textual double-checking onerous.)</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Though Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s aim to eschew the arcana of extensive scholarly debate is understandable and perhaps even commendable, his discussion might have been clarified by some attention (and response, even if not in the form of scholarly debate) to the \xE2\x80\x9Cpuzzles\xE2\x80\x9D raised by commentators on the <i>CJ</i>. One of the stronger discussions in this work is in the opening of chapter 3, where Gasch\xC3\xA9 argues against the standard interpretation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetic formalism that it is based, questionably, solely on paragraph 14, entitled \xE2\x80\x9CElucidation by Examples\xE2\x80\x9D (where Kant famously, or notoriously, glosses form as \xE2\x80\x9Cline\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cshape\xE2\x80\x9D), to the exclusion of the other, theoretically more central paragraphs in the \xE2\x80\x9Cthird moment.\xE2\x80\x9D Gasch\xC3\xA9 suggests, interestingly, that one ought to understand this paragraph as Kant\xE2\x80\x99s address to art critics (e.g., of the Winckelmann school), an attempt to draw upon their conception of form in order to encourage them to endorse his own, ultimately rather different conception of aesthetic form. Likewise, readers from the post-structuralist tradition may find Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s sympathetic characterization of the role of reason within Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics, in conversation with Lyotard\xE2\x80\x99s and Derrida\xE2\x80\x99s readings of the <i>CJ</i> and his defense of Kant against the charge of promoting a \xE2\x80\x9Cdouble\xE2\x80\x9D aesthetics (of beauty and sublimity), helpful.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Similar attention to, and argument against, opposing positions in the scholarship might have sharpened some of the unsatisfying discussion elsewhere in this work. Thus, for example, Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s glosses on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s denials of conceptual determination in judgments of taste\xE2\x80\x94that they occur \xE2\x80\x9Conly when\xE2\x80\x9D the subject is faced by objects \xE2\x80\x9Cfor which no determined [empirical] concepts are available,\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 3)\xE2\x80\x94might allow Gasch\xC3\xA9 to defend Kant against the familiar objection that on his view we ought to find all objects beautiful. (The recent essay by Dorit Barchana Lorand in <i>Kant-Studien</i>, however, endorses a somewhat similar line of interpretation with greater philosophical acuity in response to such difficulties.) But Kant is hereby rendered vulnerable to another familiar problem, that he seems to be committed to a deeply implausible view that our experiences of beautiful objects are <i>very</i> few and far between: if we can find an object beautiful only if we have no determinate (empirical) concept for it, then roses, tulips, gardens, paintings, and people cannot be found beautiful (except by young children). Since these are not only among the kinds of objects we actually tend to find beautiful but also among Kant\xE2\x80\x99s favored examples of beautiful objects, some more precise articulation of the kind of concept that is absent in judgments of taste, or the way in which such judgments are not based upon concepts, or the meaning of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s category of \xE2\x80\x9Cdependent\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Caccessory\xE2\x80\x9D beauty (judgments of which do involve determinate concepts, on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s view)\xE2\x80\x94beyond the assertion that concepts are \xE2\x80\x9Clacking\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cnot available\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94is required. Gasch\xC3\xA9 offers us the interesting item of information that at Kant\xE2\x80\x99s time, tulips were new to Europe, and considered \xE2\x80\x9Cwild\xE2\x80\x9D; this, however, does not show that Kant (or other Europeans) had no concept, \xE2\x80\x9Ctulip,\xE2\x80\x9D nor does it help us understand the possibility of the judgment, \xE2\x80\x9CThis rose is beautiful.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s work identifies promising directions for thinking about the Third Critique. His emphases upon rational systematicity in relation to taste and upon Kant\xE2\x80\x99s doctrines in the \xE2\x80\x9Cthird moment\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94from the claims concerning beautiful form to the doctrine of the ideal of beauty\xE2\x80\x94are welcome, since these are, arguably, the most frequently criticized or ignored among Kant\xE2\x80\x99s central doctrines in the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment. And Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s work takes up a position that might span the gaps between continental, literary-critical, analytic, and historical treatments of the <i>CJ</i>. This work will not, I fear, convince doubters on these counts, but it may, I hope, prompt further, cross-disciplinary discussion of reason and form in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s rich and puzzling philosophical aesthetics. </p>"

More broadly, though not \xE2\x80\x9Cthematized\xE2\x80\x9D by Gasch\xC3\xA9 as a tension, Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s characterization of the pure judgment of aesthetic form as both a \xE2\x80\x9Cminimal\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cprecognitive\xE2\x80\x9D grasp of the object and as a maximal grasp of the \xE2\x80\x9Cluxuriance\xE2\x80\x9D of an object\xE2\x80\x99s characteristics beyond (\xE2\x80\x9Cpara\xE2\x80\x9D) determinate cognition identifies an interesting, underdiscussed tension in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s description of our apprehension of beauty, and in its \xE2\x80\x9Csystematic\xE2\x80\x9D placement with respect to cognitive understanding, as both less and more than empirical knowledge.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Gasch\xC3\xA9 has, however, much more ambitious aims: he writes that he has sought \xE2\x80\x9Cto avoid . . . a critical debate with the various and often contradictory interpretations\xE2\x80\x9D of the <i>CJ</i> and promises that \xE2\x80\x9C[a]s a result of [his] reading, many of the so-called inconsistencies and puzzles that commentators have enjoyed pointing out . . . will appear . . . less problematic\xE2\x80\x9D; on his reading, Kant provides a \xE2\x80\x9Chighly consistent set of strong arguments\xE2\x80\x9D in the <i>CJ</i> (p. 11). And indeed, Gasch\xC3\xA9 cites very little Anglo-American or German scholarship; he does not even mention such prominent readers of this text as Cristel Fricke, Jens Kuhlenkampff, or Paul Guyer. Instead of scholarly debate, Gasch\xC3\xA9 writes in the style of some European commentary, using extensive, narrative paraphrase of the text, liberally interspersed with textual quotations. This style of commentary, at its best, can (re)orient the reader\xE2\x80\x99s sense of a text\xE2\x80\x99s structure and central concerns, as Gasch\xC3\xA9 does, in beginning his Critique of Aesthetic Judgment, with the \xE2\x80\x9Cthird moment\xE2\x80\x9D in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s account of the judgment of taste. On Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s reading, the justificatory questions concerning the universal yet subjective validity of the claims of taste posed in the first two moments (and ultimately addressed in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s deduction of judgments of taste) that preoccupy most commentators on the <i>CJ</i> \xE2\x80\x93and, arguably, Kant himself\xE2\x80\x94take second place to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s descriptive aesthetics of form and of \xE2\x80\x9Cboundless\xE2\x80\x9D formlessness (in the sublime) and to the systematic importance of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s identification of the \xE2\x80\x9Ctranscendental\xE2\x80\x9D status of taste.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Without further analysis and reconstruction, the paraphrastic form of commentary is, however, insufficient to clarify the frequently obscure and puzzling claims of the <i>CJ</i>, much less allay philosophical worries concerning the strength of the arguments there presented. For example, Gasch\xC3\xA9 suggests that on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s view we can and do judge works of art \xE2\x80\x93 as well as natural beauties \xE2\x80\x93 in \xE2\x80\x9Cpure\xE2\x80\x9D judgments of taste, on the basis of their \xE2\x80\x9Cmere form.\xE2\x80\x9D For, Gasch\xC3\xA9 argues, though we do judge these objects in terms of concepts (and thus would appear precisely not to be judging them in terms of Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cmere,\xE2\x80\x9D unconceptualized form), the concepts by which we judge art works have been \xE2\x80\x9Crendered indeterminate\xE2\x80\x9D by the genius, who transforms them into aesthetic ideas that contain \xE2\x80\x9Cmore\xE2\x80\x9D than can be determinately, conceptually articulated; thus, our appreciation of such ideas is identical (?) to our appreciation of the \xE2\x80\x9Cluxuriance\xE2\x80\x9D of natural beautiful form. Leaving aside difficulties (often discussed in the scholarship, but not mentioned here) concerning <i>which</i> kind of concept is employed, on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s view, in such judgments (representation? painting? post-Impressionist painting? sunflower, vase, or table? the vibrancy, terror, or fragility of life?), Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s elaboration of many different possible meanings of \xE2\x80\x9Cform\xE2\x80\x9D in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of the arts\xE2\x80\x94from \xE2\x80\x9Cacademic\xE2\x80\x9D form as necessary technique for artistic production (which, as Gasch\xC3\xA9 writes, is \xE2\x80\x9Cutterly distinct\xE2\x80\x9D from Kant\xE2\x80\x99s usage of \xE2\x80\x9Cform\xE2\x80\x9D elsewhere in the <i>CJ</i> [p. 189]), to an expression \xE2\x80\x9Cadequate\xE2\x80\x9D to the genius\xE2\x80\x99 thought (p. 190), to arrangement, composition or delineation (p. 192), to success at representation of a thing or the \xE2\x80\x9Cform of thing\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 193)\xE2\x80\x94does not persuade the reader that appreciation of aesthetic ideas or artistic beautiful form is similar to appreciation of natural form. This elaboration tends, rather, to render the Kantian concept of form itself\xE2\x80\x94already elusive in Kant, and on Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s presentation\xE2\x80\x94indeterminate.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>There are also terminological and textual imprecisions in Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s discussion that will irritate scholars and may frustrate or mislead students looking for elucidation of this difficult text. For example, in arguing (rightly) that natural, not artistic, beauty is central to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics, Gasch\xC3\xA9 repeatedly emphasizes Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claim that in order to be beautiful, art must look like nature, but usually fails to quote, and does not remark upon, Kant\xE2\x80\x99s appended claim that beautiful nature looks like art (<i>CJ</i> Ak. V: 306). Likewise, in discussing Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claims in the \xE2\x80\x9CIdeal of Beauty\xE2\x80\x9D that we must produce an ideal representation of reason\xE2\x80\x99s idea of a maximum as a standard for taste, Gasch\xC3\xA9 asserts that \xE2\x80\x9C[f]or the most part, Kant remains silent, in chapter 17, about how to conceive of such an ideal\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 106). This assertion is, at the least, highly puzzling, since Kant devotes most of paragraph 17 to arguing that the sole ideal of beauty is the representation of a (particular sort of) human form (a claim that Gasch\xC3\xA9 ducks, as requiring \xE2\x80\x9Cextensive discussion,\xE2\x80\x9D a page earlier). And, more centrally, in discussing the relationship between Kant\xE2\x80\x99s frequent denials in the <i>CJ</i> that the judgment of taste involves conceptual determination of objects, and his doctrines in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>\xE2\x80\x94how can Kant of all philosophers claim that we find objects (somehow) intelligible without any conceptualization?\xE2\x80\x94 Gasch\xC3\xA9 suggests that aesthetic experience concerns objects characterized indeed by the a priori \xE2\x80\x9Cform of a phenomenon\xE2\x80\x9D promulgated in the <i>CPR</i>, for which, however, we lack <i>empirical</i> concepts (pp. 72-3). But Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s glosses here (and throughout the book) -- \xE2\x80\x9Ca reflective aesthetic judgment takes place in the absence of any concept that would unify . . . the . . . manifold . . . before all logical determination, before all representation through which the object is thought\xE2\x80\x9D [my emphasis]\xE2\x80\x94are imprecise, given that the \xE2\x80\x9Cform of phenomena\xE2\x80\x9D of the <i>CPR</i> is, of course, conceptually determined by the categories. (It is also not helpful to most current readers of the <i>CJ</i> that Gasch\xC3\xA9 cites page numbers not from the Akademie edition, but from an old translation [Bernard], which makes textual double-checking onerous.)</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Though Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s aim to eschew the arcana of extensive scholarly debate is understandable and perhaps even commendable, his discussion might have been clarified by some attention (and response, even if not in the form of scholarly debate) to the \xE2\x80\x9Cpuzzles\xE2\x80\x9D raised by commentators on the <i>CJ</i>. One of the stronger discussions in this work is in the opening of chapter 3, where Gasch\xC3\xA9 argues against the standard interpretation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetic formalism that it is based, questionably, solely on paragraph 14, entitled \xE2\x80\x9CElucidation by Examples\xE2\x80\x9D (where Kant famously, or notoriously, glosses form as \xE2\x80\x9Cline\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cshape\xE2\x80\x9D), to the exclusion of the other, theoretically more central paragraphs in the \xE2\x80\x9Cthird moment.\xE2\x80\x9D Gasch\xC3\xA9 suggests, interestingly, that one ought to understand this paragraph as Kant\xE2\x80\x99s address to art critics (e.g., of the Winckelmann school), an attempt to draw upon their conception of form in order to encourage them to endorse his own, ultimately rather different conception of aesthetic form. Likewise, readers from the post-structuralist tradition may find Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s sympathetic characterization of the role of reason within Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics, in conversation with Lyotard\xE2\x80\x99s and Derrida\xE2\x80\x99s readings of the <i>CJ</i> and his defense of Kant against the charge of promoting a \xE2\x80\x9Cdouble\xE2\x80\x9D aesthetics (of beauty and sublimity), helpful.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Similar attention to, and argument against, opposing positions in the scholarship might have sharpened some of the unsatisfying discussion elsewhere in this work. Thus, for example, Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s glosses on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s denials of conceptual determination in judgments of taste\xE2\x80\x94that they occur \xE2\x80\x9Conly when\xE2\x80\x9D the subject is faced by objects \xE2\x80\x9Cfor which no determined [empirical] concepts are available,\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 3)\xE2\x80\x94might allow Gasch\xC3\xA9 to defend Kant against the familiar objection that on his view we ought to find all objects beautiful. (The recent essay by Dorit Barchana Lorand in <i>Kant-Studien</i>, however, endorses a somewhat similar line of interpretation with greater philosophical acuity in response to such difficulties.) But Kant is hereby rendered vulnerable to another familiar problem, that he seems to be committed to a deeply implausible view that our experiences of beautiful objects are <i>very</i> few and far between: if we can find an object beautiful only if we have no determinate (empirical) concept for it, then roses, tulips, gardens, paintings, and people cannot be found beautiful (except by young children). Since these are not only among the kinds of objects we actually tend to find beautiful but also among Kant\xE2\x80\x99s favored examples of beautiful objects, some more precise articulation of the kind of concept that is absent in judgments of taste, or the way in which such judgments are not based upon concepts, or the meaning of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s category of \xE2\x80\x9Cdependent\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Caccessory\xE2\x80\x9D beauty (judgments of which do involve determinate concepts, on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s view)\xE2\x80\x94beyond the assertion that concepts are \xE2\x80\x9Clacking\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cnot available\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94is required. Gasch\xC3\xA9 offers us the interesting item of information that at Kant\xE2\x80\x99s time, tulips were new to Europe, and considered \xE2\x80\x9Cwild\xE2\x80\x9D; this, however, does not show that Kant (or other Europeans) had no concept, \xE2\x80\x9Ctulip,\xE2\x80\x9D nor does it help us understand the possibility of the judgment, \xE2\x80\x9CThis rose is beautiful.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s work identifies promising directions for thinking about the Third Critique. His emphases upon rational systematicity in relation to taste and upon Kant\xE2\x80\x99s doctrines in the \xE2\x80\x9Cthird moment\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94from the claims concerning beautiful form to the doctrine of the ideal of beauty\xE2\x80\x94are welcome, since these are, arguably, the most frequently criticized or ignored among Kant\xE2\x80\x99s central doctrines in the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment. And Gasch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x99s work takes up a position that might span the gaps between continental, literary-critical, analytic, and historical treatments of the <i>CJ</i>. This work will not, I fear, convince doubters on these counts, but it may, I hope, prompt further, cross-disciplinary discussion of reason and form in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s rich and puzzling philosophical aesthetics. </p>"
