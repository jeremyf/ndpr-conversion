content: "<p>The bottom line is: this is a first-rate book, a scholarly, clear, illuminating and thorough study in contemporary philosophy of language.</p>  \n\
  <p>Hanna and Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s aim is to offer a third way of solving the language-world dilemma; one which cuts through the realist, representation-based explanation of language\xE2\x80\x99s relation to the world, and a relativist, intra-linguistic, coherentist one. Their method follows the well known advice (attributed to Ramsey), \xE2\x80\x9Cin philosophy, when facing a dilemma \xE2\x80\x93 find the root common to both disputants and negate it\xE2\x80\x9D. Both horns of the dilemma have been widely discussed in the philosophical literature of the last fifty years at least. What is new in the present book is that the criticism is launched from an explicitly stated standpoint \xE2\x80\x93 one that negates what both criticized positions have in common. This standpoint enables the reader to follow Hanna and Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s detailed arguments and evaluate them. I myself found most of them, not all, very convincing.</p>  \n\
  <p>The common position that is being negated is one that sees no third player in the word-world game. Having discarded mentalism, many philosophers of language, trying to understand the relationship between language and reality, believed that a middle term must lead to the pitfalls exposed already by previous appeals to the mental realm. The alternative proposed is based on the indispensability of the notion of <i>practice</i> in any account of language and its relation to the world. This in itself is not a novelty; we have known such proposals, in various guises, since at least the 1920s, and certainly since the writings of the later Wittgenstein. What is remarkable in the present book, then, is the way it proceeds from this initial proposal to evaluate and criticize its rivals, thus gradually deepening our understanding of the consequences of the appeal to practice in any philosophical account of language.</p>  \n\
  <p>Hanna and Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s most forceful and successful analysis is directed towards what they call Referential Realism, the view that meaning is achieved through a direct association of linguistic elements with independent fragments of the \xE2\x80\x9Creal world\xE2\x80\x9D. The attack on this position is accomplished through what is labeled in the book \xE2\x80\x9CWittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s Slogan\xE2\x80\x9D, that \xE2\x80\x9Clogic must take care of itself\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 the opening words of the <i>Notebooks</i> <i>1914-16</i>, later appearing in the <i>Tractatus</i> (5.473). These remarks were made by Wittgenstein <i>a</i> <i>propos</i> of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s attempts to transcend language and anchor it in pieces of reality. Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s insight was basically that meaning must be prior to truth, and hence that an account of the meaning of statements cannot rely on previously \xE2\x80\x9Cgiven\xE2\x80\x9D reference. The whole of Chapter 4 of <i>Word and World</i> consists in an impressive analysis of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s and the early Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s positions on the matter. Its conclusion is that the <i>Tractatus\xE2\x80\x99</i> failure can be attributed to the fact that this work itself was an example of Referential Realism. I find both the analysis and its conclusion very convincing. Hanna and Harrison do not attempt to offer an exegesis of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s later work and to argue (as I myself would) that Wittgenstein clung to this \xE2\x80\x9Cslogan\xE2\x80\x9D throughout his lifetime, while shifting, updating and loosening the concept of logic in order to accommodate it to his later ideas on the centrality of practice for language. They do, however, endorse \xE2\x80\x9Cthe programme announced by Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s Slogan: the programme of showing that, and how, \xE2\x80\x98Logic\xE2\x80\x99 (that is, everything that concerns the fitness for truth or falsity of the sentential sign) <i>can</i> \xE2\x80\x99take care of itself\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9C (93), that is, that the \xE2\x80\x9Cslogan\xE2\x80\x9D can be interpreted in a way that makes it very relevant today. Indeed, it is the way the \xE2\x80\x9Cslogan\xE2\x80\x9D is used in the book that is so thought-provoking. Hanna and Harrison virtually divide the contemporary analytic arena into two groups of philosophers: \xE2\x80\x9CRussellians\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CWittgensteinians\xE2\x80\x9D, i.e., those who still wish to anchor language in some sort of external, independent reality that is directly connected to meaning, and those who deny this possibility as senseless. (But see a reservation regarding this terminology on p. 46.) The best-known controversy along these lines is of course that regarding the relationship of a name to its bearer, where Kripke naturally represents the hard core of the Russellian attitude. Chapters 5-7 deal extensively with this issue.</p>  \n\
  <p>However, I do not wish, in this review, to go into the details of the analysis of any particular topic, but to suggest a reading of the general strategy. For what I find fascinating in the move taken by Hanna and Harrison is its surprising resemblance to the one taken by Russell himself, versus Frege, in \xE2\x80\x9COn Denoting\xE2\x80\x9D. Although Hanna and Harison discuss the differences between Frege and Russell\xE2\x80\x99s positions, they don\xE2\x80\x99t mention Frege\xE2\x80\x99s principle \xE2\x80\x9Cnever to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition\xE2\x80\x9D (Frege, <i>Foundations of Arithmetic</i>, p. x). This \xE2\x80\x9Ccontext principle\xE2\x80\x9D is often seen as one of the founding moves of analytic philosophy. It is not merely a rejection of atomism and mentalism; it is a methodological decision to answer metaphysical questions by looking at our language, by understanding concepts as words, and words as belonging to linguistic structure. (Cf., e.g., Michael Dummett, <i>Origins of Analytical Philosophy</i>, p. 5.)</p>  \n\
  <p>Russell\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Ctrick\xE2\x80\x9D in \xE2\x80\x9COn Denoting\xE2\x80\x9D is, in a sense, to implement Frege\xE2\x80\x99s principle more thoroughly and consistently than Frege himself. Of course, in another sense, Russell contradicts this principle completely \xE2\x80\x93 when he declares, e.g., that \xE2\x80\x9Call thinking has to start from acquaintance\xE2\x80\x9D (\xE2\x80\x9COn Denoting\xE2\x80\x9D, 104). This aspect of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s position is precisely the one attacked later by \xE2\x80\x9CWittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s slogan\xE2\x80\x9D and discussed in <i>Word and World</i>. Yet when Russell proposes a solution to a problem caused by Frege\xE2\x80\x99s disloyalty to Leibniz\xE2\x80\x99 principle of \xE2\x80\x9C<i>salva veritate</i>\xE2\x80\x9D, he implements a line of thinking remarkably close to that of Hanna and Harrison in their book. In both cases we find \xE2\x80\x9Ccorrections\xE2\x80\x9D to current theories of meaning that are suggested (implicitly) as implementations of Frege\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Ccontext principle\xE2\x80\x9D. Russell presents his puzzle thus:</p>  <blockquote>Now George IV wished to know whether Scott was the author of <i>Waverly</i>; and in fact Scott <i>was</i> the author of <i>Waverly</i>. Hence we may substitute <i>Scott</i> for <i>the author or Waverly</i>, and thereby prove that George IV wished to know whether Scott was Scott. (\xE2\x80\x9COn Denoting\xE2\x80\x9D, 110)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>Russell\xE2\x80\x99s solution to the puzzle is \xE2\x80\x9Cvery simple\xE2\x80\x9D, as he says. \xE2\x80\x9CThe propositions \xE2\x80\x99Scott was the author of <i>Waverly\xE2\x80\x99</i>\xE2\x80\xA6 does not contain any constituent \xE2\x80\x99the author of <i>Waverly\xE2\x80\x99</i> for which we could substitute \xE2\x80\x99Scott\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9C (\xE2\x80\x9COn Denoting\xE2\x80\x9D, 114). This is because words do not get their significance in isolation, but only in contexts of propositions \xE2\x80\x93 and Russell has shown in his article how to analyze the relevant proposition in such a way that <i>none of its constituents is \xE2\x80\x99the author of</i> Waverly\xE2\x80\x99.</p>  \n\
  <p>I believe that Hanna and Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s principal argument against Referential Realism appeals precisely to this line of reasoning. Although speaking of the primacy of <i>practices</i> does not, <i>prima facie</i>, seem to be consistent with Frege\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Ccontext principle\xE2\x80\x9D, I think that the \xE2\x80\x9Clinguistic turn\xE2\x80\x9D that was initiated with the principle is not at all breached by the main argument of <i>Word and World</i>, but, on the contrary, strengthened. Moreover, it is precisely Russell\xE2\x80\x99s way of interpreting the principle contra Frege that is implemented here, contra \xE2\x80\x9CRussellians\xE2\x80\x9D. Introducing a third term \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x99practice\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x93 as intermediate between the traditional realist duo of \xE2\x80\x99word\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x99world\xE2\x80\x99, makes it impossible to ask for <i>constituents</i> of reality that are supposed to stand in <i>correlation</i> to the linguistic structure. This is the main argument, in a nutshell:</p>  <blockquote>According to this model, there is no associative link between any member of any category of linguistic expressions and any extralinguistic entity, whether metaphysically or naturalistically conceived. More generally, the kind of relationship between language and the world that does obtain cannot, without the risk of serious misunderstanding, be described as any kind of \xE2\x80\x9Clinkage\xE2\x80\x9D connecting \xE2\x80\x9Citems\xE2\x80\x9D drawn respectively from two \xE2\x80\x9Crealms\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\xA6 What actually relates language to reality\xE2\x80\xA6 is better conceived as a two-level process of engagement, or embedding: at the first level the engagement, or embedding, of linguistic expressions in practices; at the second level the engagement, or embedding, of practices in the matrix of natural conditions and circumstances, in and with respect to which they are carried on. (48)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>The two-stage relationship enables us to see that questions about word-world relationship (questions about truth and falsity, primarily), indeed are separate from, and come after, a general understanding of the way linguistic expressions acquire their specific meanings, in various context of action. At any rate, truth cannot be seen as simple \xE2\x80\x9Cmirroring\xE2\x80\x9D; exactly as in Russell\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9COn Denoting\xE2\x80\x9D, for in most sentences, the analysis shows that there is no relevant linguistic structure to which the simple notion of correspondence could apply. Rather, we have to appeal to a network of connected actions, involving a mixture of \xE2\x80\x9Cwords\xE2\x80\x9D with bits of \xE2\x80\x9Cworld\xE2\x80\x9D. An interesting corollary of this result is a strong appeal to a \xE2\x80\x9Cknowing-how\xE2\x80\x9D (practical knowledge) that cannot be reduced to any well-phrased assertoric \xE2\x80\x9Cknowing-that\xE2\x80\x9D. This means that the theory of meaning many contemporary philosophers seek cannot actually be gained (and hence sought at all) \xE2\x80\x93 our knowledge of meanings is too deeply embedded in our actions and cannot be disentangled, made into a pure linguistic formula.</p>  \n\
  <p>However, the appeal to those \xE2\x80\x9Cbits of world\xE2\x80\x9D that play an important role in our practices is a bit misleading. Indeed I think that Hanna and Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s only major problem in their account is that they present their solution as another version of <i>realism</i>, as they do in the book\xE2\x80\x99s long Epilogue. Although they are happy to admit their anti-realism about, e.g., reference and concepts (349), Hanna and Harrison are convinced that on the whole, their proposal should be seen as a version of realism, metaphysical realism.</p>  <blockquote>If metaphysical realism is, as Putnam puts it, the claim that the world is independent of any particular representation of it, then at the level of the constitution of linguistic practices we confront a world of which metaphysical realism is simply true. (352)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>But despite their thoughtful and sincere attempts to explain, in the pages that follow the above quote, why their philosophical proposal can be seen as realist, I think that Hanna and Harrison do not succeed in conferring on their notion of the world the independence needed for a genuine realist position. Their world \xE2\x80\x93 I am happy to say, as an anti-realist \xE2\x80\x93 is strongly connected to our linguistic practices and cannot be disentangled from them. Indeed, there is no particular representation or the world that \xE2\x80\x9Ccaptures\xE2\x80\x9D it, hence it may seem that the world is indeed independent of any particular representation of it \xE2\x80\x93 but, according to Hanna and Harrison themselves, the world <i>is</i> dependent on the ongoing linguistic practice, as fractured, multi-layered, multi-faceted and even inconsistent as it is. Such a view is, luckily, metaphysical indeed \xE2\x80\x93 but it is not a metaphysical realism.</p>  \n\
  <p>One of the virtues of the book is its scope \xE2\x80\x93 the fact that practically all the significant views pertaining to the philosophy of language in the previous century are seriously and thoroughly discussed. Thus, apart from Russell and Wittgenstein, already mentioned, there are lengthy discussions of Quine, Putnam, Davidson, Dummett, Kripke, and McDowell. All the philosophical positions that are criticized are very fairly presented. This is true in particular of the \xE2\x80\x9CRussellian\xE2\x80\x9D positions, such as Quine\xE2\x80\x99s or Kripke\xE2\x80\x99s, and of every Referential Realist that is moved by anti-mentalist and anti-relativist motivations; but it is no less true of the more \xE2\x80\x9Cidealist\xE2\x80\x9D position \xE2\x80\x93 with which, as I have just argued, Hanna and Harrison implicitly side. (See, e.g., a comment on usual misunderstandings by Anglophone readers of Saussure, Merleau-Ponty and Derrida, on p. 268.) In general, Hanna and Harrison repeat the modest statement that theirs is not an exegetical aim, thus defending themselves from unfair presentations of the philosophers they discuss \xE2\x80\x93 especially those that are relatively briefly mentioned.</p>  \n\
  <p>In sum, this is a very impressive book, which I strongly recommend both for scholars and advanced students in the philosophy of language.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

Rather, we have to appeal to a network of connected actions, involving a mixture of \xE2\x80\x9Cwords\xE2\x80\x9D with bits of \xE2\x80\x9Cworld\xE2\x80\x9D. An interesting corollary of this result is a strong appeal to a \xE2\x80\x9Cknowing-how\xE2\x80\x9D (practical knowledge) that cannot be reduced to any well-phrased assertoric \xE2\x80\x9Cknowing-that\xE2\x80\x9D. This means that the theory of meaning many contemporary philosophers seek cannot actually be gained (and hence sought at all) \xE2\x80\x93 our knowledge of meanings is too deeply embedded in our actions and cannot be disentangled, made into a pure linguistic formula.</p>  \n\
  <p>However, the appeal to those \xE2\x80\x9Cbits of world\xE2\x80\x9D that play an important role in our practices is a bit misleading. Indeed I think that Hanna and Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s only major problem in their account is that they present their solution as another version of <i>realism</i>, as they do in the book\xE2\x80\x99s long Epilogue. Although they are happy to admit their anti-realism about, e.g., reference and concepts (349), Hanna and Harrison are convinced that on the whole, their proposal should be seen as a version of realism, metaphysical realism.</p>  <blockquote>If metaphysical realism is, as Putnam puts it, the claim that the world is independent of any particular representation of it, then at the level of the constitution of linguistic practices we confront a world of which metaphysical realism is simply true. (352)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>But despite their thoughtful and sincere attempts to explain, in the pages that follow the above quote, why their philosophical proposal can be seen as realist, I think that Hanna and Harrison do not succeed in conferring on their notion of the world the independence needed for a genuine realist position. Their world \xE2\x80\x93 I am happy to say, as an anti-realist \xE2\x80\x93 is strongly connected to our linguistic practices and cannot be disentangled from them. Indeed, there is no particular representation or the world that \xE2\x80\x9Ccaptures\xE2\x80\x9D it, hence it may seem that the world is indeed independent of any particular representation of it \xE2\x80\x93 but, according to Hanna and Harrison themselves, the world <i>is</i> dependent on the ongoing linguistic practice, as fractured, multi-layered, multi-faceted and even inconsistent as it is. Such a view is, luckily, metaphysical indeed \xE2\x80\x93 but it is not a metaphysical realism.</p>  \n\
  <p>One of the virtues of the book is its scope \xE2\x80\x93 the fact that practically all the significant views pertaining to the philosophy of language in the previous century are seriously and thoroughly discussed. Thus, apart from Russell and Wittgenstein, already mentioned, there are lengthy discussions of Quine, Putnam, Davidson, Dummett, Kripke, and McDowell. All the philosophical positions that are criticized are very fairly presented. This is true in particular of the \xE2\x80\x9CRussellian\xE2\x80\x9D positions, such as Quine\xE2\x80\x99s or Kripke\xE2\x80\x99s, and of every Referential Realist that is moved by anti-mentalist and anti-relativist motivations; but it is no less true of the more \xE2\x80\x9Cidealist\xE2\x80\x9D position \xE2\x80\x93 with which, as I have just argued, Hanna and Harrison implicitly side. (See, e.g., a comment on usual misunderstandings by Anglophone readers of Saussure, Merleau-Ponty and Derrida, on p. 268.) In general, Hanna and Harrison repeat the modest statement that theirs is not an exegetical aim, thus defending themselves from unfair presentations of the philosophers they discuss \xE2\x80\x93 especially those that are relatively briefly mentioned.</p>  \n\
  <p>In sum, this is a very impressive book, which I strongly recommend both for scholars and advanced students in the philosophy of language.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
