content: "<p>As Peter Kivy points out in the Preface to his new enlarged edition of <i>The Seventh Sense</i>, even some twenty-seven years after its first appearance the work remains the only book-length study of both Francis Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Inquiries</i> and the seminal role they have played in the history of modern aesthetics. While much has been written since the first edition was published in 1976, both on Hutcheson and the eighteenth century origins of aesthetics more generally, nobody has attempted to revisit so comprehensively the ground originally uncovered by Kivy\xE2\x80\x99s efforts. Unlike most second editions, however, a change of subtitle and a new publisher, notwithstanding, the author has chosen not to \xE2\x80\x9Clay violent hands\xE2\x80\x9D on the text, opting instead to supplement it with seven of his essays written since the book appeared, and previously published in various journals and collections. These provide \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99revisions\xE2\x80\x99 in their own way,\xE2\x80\x9D Kivy remarks (x), and together constitute the new third part of the book\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9DThe Logic of Taste\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94with Parts I and II containing an imprint of the original 1976 edition.</p>  \n\
  <p>Part I\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9DHutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s First \xE2\x80\x99Inquiry\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x94begins with a survey of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s philosophical forbears, locating in the likes of Lord Herbert of Cherbury\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural instincts,\xE2\x80\x9D Henry More\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Csense of virtue,\xE2\x80\x9D and especially Shaftesbury\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Charmony of parts,\xE2\x80\x9D the conceptual predecessors of philosophical categories Hutcheson was to make his own: the faculty of taste and the sense of beauty. At the same time, Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s originality, Kivy emphasizes, lies in his decisive break with the past, his courage to rush in where the pre-moderns feared to tread and unite English Platonism with John Locke, the \xE2\x80\x9Cguiding spirit of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetic theory\xE2\x80\x9D (25). Over the course of five consecutive chapters Kivy guides the reader through the intricacies of this achievement. Combining his considerable analytic skills with an intimate knowledge of the texts, Kivy clarifies Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s understanding of \xE2\x80\x9Csense,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cbeauty,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cbeautiful,\xE2\x80\x9D reconstructs a philosophy of art from his various remarks, and, in the final chapter of Part I, considers what he calls Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Ctheological aesthetics.\xE2\x80\x9D Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s accomplishment, Kivy concludes, lies in the \xE2\x80\x9Cvital role\xE2\x80\x9D of \xE2\x80\x9Caesthetic sense\xE2\x80\x9D in \xE2\x80\x9Cforming . . . aesthetic philosophy as we know it today\xE2\x80\x9D (122), and, more importantly, in carving out a \xE2\x80\x9Cseparate realm of experience . . . made manifest by [his] sense of beauty\xE2\x80\x9D (123).</p>  \n\
  <p>Along the way there are some real gems of interpretation. In Chapter 3, for instance (\xE2\x80\x9CThe Sense of \xE2\x80\x99Beauty\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9C), Kivy unravels the often muddled manner in which Hutcheson picks up and weaves Locke\xE2\x80\x99s way of ideas into his thinking. This is a task complicated by Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s tendency to characterize \xE2\x80\x9Cbeauty\xE2\x80\x9D (for Locke a \xE2\x80\x9Cmixed mode\xE2\x80\x9D) both as a secondary idea <i>and</i> as a special kind of pleasure; in some passages Hutcheson does not bother to disambiguate the meaning of the term at all. Kivy solves the puzzle (with a little help from Bishop Berkeley\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of \xE2\x80\x9Cheat\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cpain\xE2\x80\x9D in the <i>Dialogues</i>) by arguing that Hutcheson views them as \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo descriptions of the <i>same</i> simple idea\xE2\x80\x9D (57). Some equally fancy philosophical footwork is on display in chapter 4 (\xE2\x80\x9CThe Sense of \xE2\x80\x99Beautiful\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9C) where Kivy effectively undermines the noncognitivist reading of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x94the view that to say \xE2\x80\x9CX is beautiful\xE2\x80\x9D is to express, but not describe, a state of mind\xE2\x80\x94by way of the latter\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy of language. The noncognitivist interpretation is untenable, Kivy argues, because Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s (Lockean) linguistic commitments rule out such an analysis in principle: since \xE2\x80\x9CHutcheson did not recognize the nondescriptive use of language,\xE2\x80\x9D Kivy points out, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe possibility that \xE2\x80\x99X is beautiful\xE2\x80\x99 <i>both</i> describes the state of feeling I am in <i>and</i> expresses it does not exist for Hutcheson.  Expressing is describing\xE2\x80\x94and that is the end of that\xE2\x80\x9D (65).</p>  \n\
  <p>As admiring as he is of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s overall achievement, however, Kivy has no qualms in holding his doctrines to the highest standards of twentieth century philosophical rigor, and, on more than one occasion, of finding them sorely wanting. In his discussion of aesthetic sense, for example, Kivy shows that none of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s criteria\xE2\x80\x94independence from the will, innateness, independence from knowledge, and immediacy\xE2\x80\x94is sufficient for distinguishing it from reason (36ff.); he is rightly suspicious of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s analytic and non-falsifiable conception of \xE2\x80\x9Cdisagreement\xE2\x80\x9D (81-82); and while full of praise for the formalist elements implicit in Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s approach to the arts, he is quick to point out how his \xE2\x80\x9Carousal theory\xE2\x80\x9D of musical expression is hopelessly at odds with the representational theory of literature he also espouses (108-109). At certain points, Kivy is clearly frustrated with the imprecision and sometime incoherence of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s position, and when it comes to the latter\xE2\x80\x99s attempt to address \xE2\x80\x9Cthe existence of God, and the theological underpinnings of aesthetic perception\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94topics which occupy \xE2\x80\x9Cabout one-third\xE2\x80\x9D of the first <i>Inquiry</i> (111)\xE2\x80\x94Kivy (by his own admission) can hide his impatience no longer. Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s version of the design argument founders impotently on the problem of evil, Kivy urges, and amounts to little more than saying \xE2\x80\x9CWe are the way we are . . . because God wishes to please us\xE2\x80\x9D (121). Although mitigated by the enormity of the task he set himself, \xE2\x80\x9CHutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetic theology,\xE2\x80\x9D Kivy concludes, amounts to \xE2\x80\x9Cdeplorable backsliding\xE2\x80\x9D (123).</p>  \n\
  <p>Part II\xE2\x80\x94Hutcheson-And Shortly Thereafter\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94amounts to a natural history of the sense of beauty as the concept \xE2\x80\x9Cworked itself out in eighteenth century Britain\xE2\x80\x9D (127). Kivy follows the fate of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s theory from three \xE2\x80\x9Crationalist\xE2\x80\x9D critics of moral sense (John Balguy, Berkeley, and Richard Price) through David Hume\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9COf the Standard of Taste\xE2\x80\x9D and Thomas Reid\xE2\x80\x99s common sense philosophy\xE2\x80\x94the \xE2\x80\x9Cfinal flowering\xE2\x80\x9D of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s doctrine (158)\xE2\x80\x94to its eventual defeat by its \xE2\x80\x9Cbosom serpent: the association of ideas,\xE2\x80\x9D tamed and led by the likes of Archibald Alison and Dugald Stewart. Indeed, as Kivy tells the tale, the inner sense doctrine met its end through one aspect of the very philosophy\xE2\x80\x94Locke\xE2\x80\x99s way of ideas\xE2\x80\x94that had given it life. Since Hutcheson was willing to use associationism \xE2\x80\x9Cnegatively\xE2\x80\x9D to explain diversity in the face of an ostensibly <i>universal</i> sense or instinct (82ff.), there was no reason why others should not use the same doctrine \xE2\x80\x9Cpositively\xE2\x80\x9D to explain all pleasure and displeasure as the product of association. Inner sense could then be dispensed with altogether, and taste become\xE2\x80\x94as it did for Stewart\xE2\x80\x94simply an acquired power of discrimination (216).</p>  \n\
  <p>Reading\xE2\x80\x94or for many rereading\xE2\x80\x94Kivy\xE2\x80\x99s book, gives one a sense of why it still remains the only study of its kind: it is hard to imagine how any rewriting could have improved the book\xE2\x80\x99s philosophical content, and, combined with Kivy\xE2\x80\x99s faith that he \xE2\x80\x9Cgot things more or less right\xE2\x80\x9D the first time around, it seems perfectly reasonable to have left good alone. At the same time, however, Kivy has continued to write about Hutcheson and eighteenth century aesthetics, and himself remarks on how in the course of so doing he has \xE2\x80\x9Cbecome clearer about some things, less sure of others,\xE2\x80\x9D and, \xE2\x80\x9Cfrom time to time\xE2\x80\x9D even changed his mind (ix). Hence the collection of essays to \xE2\x80\x9Csupplement\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Crevise\xE2\x80\x9D the original edition.</p>  \n\
  <p>Taken individually, the essays are a pleasure to read: clear, informative, and precise, like <i>The Seventh Sense</i> itself. Many, if not all, of the essays will be familiar to students of eighteenth century aesthetics, especially \xE2\x80\x9CThe Logic of Taste--the First Fifty Years\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CHume\xE2\x80\x99s Neighbour\xE2\x80\x99s Wife\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94chapters 13 and 16, respectively\xE2\x80\x94which have become minor classics in the field. Yet one drawback to \xE2\x80\x9Crevising\xE2\x80\x9D the text in this manner is that the essays are effectively left to speak for themselves, and, as a result, it is not always easy to locate exactly where Kivy\xE2\x80\x99s changes of mind have occurred. Further, the scene-setting and philosophical detail clearly required for self-contained articles sometimes appears as redundancy when read directly after <i>The Seventh Sense</i>: many of the substantive issues in Part III have already been addressed in Parts I and II and, on important points of interpretation, Kivy\xE2\x80\x99s conclusions do not seem to have changed that much. Summaries of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s basic doctrines (Chapters 2-5) and his indebtedness to Locke (Chapters 2 and 4), for example, reappear at various junctures; that Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s idea of beauty is complex (Chapter 3) is rehearsed again in response to a paper by Dabney Townsend (Chapter14); the non-cognitivist character of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy (Chapter 4) is restated while uncovering a \xE2\x80\x9Clogic of taste\xE2\x80\x9D in Addison\xE2\x80\x99s essays (Chapter 13), and the analysis of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy of art (Chapter 5) is recast in an essay on Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s place in the history of aesthetics (Chapter 15). This is not to deny that there are significant changes of emphasis in the later essays: the argument that Hutcheson moves from the aesthetic to the moral while Hume from the moral to the aesthetic is a case in point (Chapter 16), as are the final two essays (Chapters 19 and 20), where Kivy argues that Reid\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics represents both an alternative to the moral sense tradition (chapter 19) and that his originality and importance lies in the fact that he \xE2\x80\x9Cput the capstone on eighteenth British aesthetics . . . in so far as it was a theory of <i>perception</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (338). Nonetheless, the reader would have been well-served had Kivy offered some explicit pointers as to precisely how his views have developed and altered over the intervening years.</p>  \n\
  <p>In the final analysis, however, this is mere carping, and it should detract neither from the undisputable value of Kivy\xE2\x80\x99s achievement nor from the service done to the philosophical community by Oxford University Press in bringing the work back into print. As Hutcheson and his contemporaries were fond of emphasizing, one mark of excellence in any creative or scholarly endeavor is that it has stood the test of time, and received, as Addison puts it, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe sanction of the politer part of our contemporaries.\xE2\x80\x9D Kivy\xE2\x80\x99s book passes this test with flying colors, and there is no reason to think that it will not endure through a span of further years with the same resilience that has seen it so well through the past three decades.</p>"

Summaries of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s basic doctrines (Chapters 2-5) and his indebtedness to Locke (Chapters 2 and 4), for example, reappear at various junctures; that Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s idea of beauty is complex (Chapter 3) is rehearsed again in response to a paper by Dabney Townsend (Chapter14); the non-cognitivist character of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy (Chapter 4) is restated while uncovering a \xE2\x80\x9Clogic of taste\xE2\x80\x9D in Addison\xE2\x80\x99s essays (Chapter 13), and the analysis of Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy of art (Chapter 5) is recast in an essay on Hutcheson\xE2\x80\x99s place in the history of aesthetics (Chapter 15). This is not to deny that there are significant changes of emphasis in the later essays: the argument that Hutcheson moves from the aesthetic to the moral while Hume from the moral to the aesthetic is a case in point (Chapter 16), as are the final two essays (Chapters 19 and 20), where Kivy argues that Reid\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics represents both an alternative to the moral sense tradition (chapter 19) and that his originality and importance lies in the fact that he \xE2\x80\x9Cput the capstone on eighteenth British aesthetics . . . in so far as it was a theory of <i>perception</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (338). Nonetheless, the reader would have been well-served had Kivy offered some explicit pointers as to precisely how his views have developed and altered over the intervening years.</p>  \n\
  <p>In the final analysis, however, this is mere carping, and it should detract neither from the undisputable value of Kivy\xE2\x80\x99s achievement nor from the service done to the philosophical community by Oxford University Press in bringing the work back into print. As Hutcheson and his contemporaries were fond of emphasizing, one mark of excellence in any creative or scholarly endeavor is that it has stood the test of time, and received, as Addison puts it, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe sanction of the politer part of our contemporaries.\xE2\x80\x9D Kivy\xE2\x80\x99s book passes this test with flying colors, and there is no reason to think that it will not endure through a span of further years with the same resilience that has seen it so well through the past three decades.</p>"
