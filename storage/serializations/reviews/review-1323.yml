content: "<p>What, the reader of this review may well wonder, is the point of a collection of essays connecting Marx and Wittgenstein? After all, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is possible to take almost <i>any</i> two thinkers of genuine insight and sophistication and to find some parallels and commonalities in their thought. Indeed, doing so is one of the favourite intellectual pastimes of all academics.\xE2\x80\x9D Indeed, one could legitimately ask whether \xE2\x80\x9Cany two thinkers have <i>less</i> in common than Karl Marx and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\xE2\x80\x9D Consider, for a moment, the case for the prosecution. On the one hand we have Marx, political activist and economic theorist, the founder of the \xE2\x80\x99science\xE2\x80\x99 of \xE2\x80\x99historical materialism,\xE2\x80\x99 whose <i>Theses on Feuerbach</i> proclaim that \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the thing however is to change it.\xE2\x80\x9D On the other, Wittgenstein, a philosopher who \xE2\x80\x9Cshowed virtually no interest in conventional political activity,\xE2\x80\x9D famous for writing that \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy . . . leaves everything as it is\xE2\x80\x9D and who asked himself \xE2\x80\x9Cwho knows the laws by which society evolves?\xE2\x80\x9D only to answer \xE2\x80\x9CI am sure they are a closed book to the cleverest of men.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Gavin Kitching\xE2\x80\x99s excellent introduction to <i>Marx and Wittgenstein</i> not only anticipates and responds to these objections\xE2\x80\x94all of the quotations in the previous paragraph are taken from his opening essay\xE2\x80\x94but also provides a helpful orientation as to the range of approaches taken by the contributors to this volume. Kitching\xE2\x80\x99s response to these objections is carefully measured. He sums up the point of the book in terms of three interrelated aims, aims that echo the Hegelian triad of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Kitching tells us that the book as a whole aims to show that (1) there are important commonalities in the thought of the two writers; (2) there are, nevertheless, important differences between Marx and Wittgenstein, and among Marxian Wittgensteinians; (3) yet a synthesis of Marx and Wittgenstein can be \xE2\x80\x9C<i>mutually enriching</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (pp. 2-3).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The principal historical connections lie partly in Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s sympathy for certain aspects of the left in the 1930s\xE2\x80\x94he is said to have described himself as \xE2\x80\x9Ca communist, <i>at heart</i>\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94and partly in the question of the role that Pierro Sraffa\xE2\x80\x99s Marxism might have played in his role as \xE2\x80\x9Cstimulus for the most consequential ideas\xE2\x80\x9D of the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>.<sup><a name=\"1b\" href=\"#1\">1</a></sup> The principal systematic commonalities lie in Marx\xE2\x80\x99s and Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s rejection of the dualism of subject and object, observer and observed, and their turn toward human action or practice. The principal differences, as indicated above, have to do with the contrast between Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s opposition to scientism, and scepticism about a science of society, and the Marxist pursuit of such a science. Furthermore, the individual contributors disagree greatly about the possibility and desirability of a synthesis of Marx and Wittgenstein. I will return to the question how far the book realizes its editors\xE2\x80\x99 aims after a brief survey of the individual contributions.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The fourteen essays are arranged into six parts, each bearing a title that sums up its contribution to the story mapped out in the Introduction. In Part I, \xE2\x80\x9CConventional Wisdoms,\xE2\x80\x9D T. P. Uschanov reviews the reception history of Ernest Gellner\xE2\x80\x99s polemical attack on Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy in general, and Gellner\xE2\x80\x99s caricature of him as a covert political conservative, pursuing his political commitments under cover of philosophical impartiality, in particular. While Gellner\xE2\x80\x99s critique, largely composed of shoddy rhetoric, insinuation and personal abuse, created considerable controversy, it was dismissed by the philosophical establishment at the time. However, his caricature of Wittgenstein was enormously attractive to those who needed a convenient rationale for dismissing him. It has since become conventional wisdom in many quarters, and especially among social scientists, and is certainly part of the reason why a relatively small number of social scientists on the left have taken a serious interest in Wittgenstein.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In Part II, \xE2\x80\x9CCommonalities,\xE2\x80\x9D four different ways of connecting the two thinkers are explored. Ted Schatzki approaches the connections between Marx and Wittgenstein by considering their conceptions of natural history; David Rubinstein looks at their understanding of culture and practical reason; David Andrews gives a Wittgenstein-influenced reading of Marx on commodity fetishism; and Terrell Carver discusses their relationship to postmodernism.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In Part III, \xE2\x80\x9CWittgenstein and Sraffa,\xE2\x80\x9D Keiran Sharpe and John B. Davis, both experts on economics and philosophy, provide informative and complementary accounts of how Sraffa\xE2\x80\x99s Marxism, and his particular approach to economics and questions of economic theory, could have influenced Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s work on the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. Sharpe sees the link in terms of the emphasis on the inter-relationship between social action, criteria, and context in Sraffa\xE2\x80\x99s work, and the ways this would have led him to criticize the \xE2\x80\x9Casocial epistemology\xE2\x80\x9D (127) of the <i>Tractatus</i>. Davis highlights the parallels between Gramsci\xE2\x80\x99s unveiling of hidden structures of power, Sraffa\xE2\x80\x99s historicist critique of neo-classical economics, and Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of family resemblance, rule-following and practice. Sharpe, by dint of carefully assembling and arranging the available evidence, makes a surprisingly strong case for what must be a matter of conjecture; Davis makes the far stronger, and highly implausible, claim that Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s later ideas \xE2\x80\x9Cpresupposed the same philosophical posture of critique that Sraffa\xE2\x80\x99s (and Gramsci\xE2\x80\x99s) possessed\xE2\x80\x9D (142).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Part IV, \xE2\x80\x9CDisjunctions,\xE2\x80\x9D draws our attention to a leading area of disagreement among the contributors, concerning the nature of the relationship between the everyday use of language and social-scientific uses of language. In view of Peter Winch\xE2\x80\x99s pivotal role in the debate over this topic, and his formative influence on most social scientists interested in Wittgenstein, it is appropriate that both Ted Benton, in \xE2\x80\x9CWittgenstein, Winch and Marx,\xE2\x80\x9D and Nigel Pleasants in \xE2\x80\x9CTowards a critical use of Marx and Wittgenstein,\xE2\x80\x9D approach this issue by means of a discussion of Winch\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation of Wittgenstein. Benton identifies a tension in Winch between the naturalistic tenor of most of his work and his commitment to the anti-naturalistic view that one cannot give a causal account of human action. His proposed resolution is to give up the anti-naturalism, a position that is justified by an appeal to \xE2\x80\x9CWittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s naturalism.\xE2\x80\x9D Benton\xE2\x80\x99s Wittgenstein has a conception of human nature that is a restatement of Marx\xE2\x80\x99s: a Wittgenstein, like Rubinstein\xE2\x80\x99s and Schatzki\xE2\x80\x99s, made safe for a traditional sociological theory, by way of a reading of his philosophy as a theory of practice. Pleasants, on the other hand, like Fann, Kitching, Carver, and Read, contends that a construal of Wittgenstein as a practice theorist, a philosopher who put forward a theory of the social constitution of mind and meaning in order to undermine the methodological individualism of traditional philosophy, reproduces the very methodological errors Wittgenstein opposes. Pleasants\xE2\x80\x99 Wittgenstein conceives of philosophy as an activity of clarification, one that brings about a change in the way we look at things but does not consist in the production of a theory of society or of practice: \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is to be avoided is the tendency\xE2\x80\x94of both Wittgensteinians and Marxists\xE2\x80\x94to automatically assume there must be an authentic \xE2\x80\x99Wittgensteinian\xE2\x80\x99 or \xE2\x80\x99Marxist\xE2\x80\x99 line on whatever engages their interest\xE2\x80\x9D (165).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Part V, \xE2\x80\x9CForerunners,\xE2\x80\x9D complicates the relatively self-contained story told so far, as it draws connections with previous work on the Marx-Wittgenstein connection. The first published essay on Marx and Wittgenstein, Ferrucio Rossi-Landi\xE2\x80\x99s rich and provocative \xE2\x80\x9CTowards a Marxian use of Wittgenstein,\xE2\x80\x9D originally published in Italian in 1966, is reprinted in a slightly shortened version. Joachim Israel\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CRemarks on Marxism and the philosophy of language\xE2\x80\x9D looks at the encounter between Wittgenstein and Marx within Marxist philosophy of language. He first considers Volosinov and Bakhtin as anticipators of Wittgenstein, then turns to a critique of Rossi-Landi\xE2\x80\x99s reading of Wittgenstein, and ends by recommending Markus\xE2\x80\x99 use of Wittgenstein in developing a contemporary Marxist philosophy of language.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Part VI, \xE2\x80\x9CKnowledge, morality and politics\xE2\x80\x9D reprises the subtitle of the book and promises the most direct engagement with the aim of showing how the encounter between Marx and Wittgenstein can be philosophically productive. Kitching\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CMarxism and reflectivity\xE2\x80\x9D approaches the question of whether Marxism is a science by way of a highly critical reading of Wright, Levine, and Sober\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Reconstructing Marxism</i>. He identifies the leading failure of that book as a lack of reflexivity, the very reflexivity that Kitching identifies as central to both Marx\xE2\x80\x99s and Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s approach to understanding practice. Read\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CMarx and Wittgenstein on vampires and parasites\xE2\x80\x9D draws parallels between Wittgenstein on the relationship between the language of everyday and philosophical language, and Marx\xE2\x80\x99s account of exploitation in capitalism. Finally, Fann\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CBeyond Marx and Wittgenstein (A confession of a Wittgensteinian Marxist turned Taoist)\xE2\x80\x9D provides an apt autobiographical conclusion. It tells the story of his journey from postwar Taiwan to the US in search of a rational faith, his combination of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s critique of metaphysics with Marxism-Leninism\xE2\x80\x99s critique of capitalism, his proselytizing support for Mao\xE2\x80\x99s Cultural Revolution, his rediscovery of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s anti-scientism after the collapse of communism, and his Taoist rejection of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s and Marx\xE2\x80\x99s demanding ideals in favor of a life lived as an end in itself, not as a means to an end.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>To what extent, then, will the book as a whole realize its editors\xE2\x80\x99 hopes that bringing Marx and Wittgenstein together in this way will lead to an open, intense, and honest \xE2\x80\x9Cdialogue both among and between Marxists and Wittgensteinians\xE2\x80\x9D (xv)? That depends, to a very large extent, on how one conceives of such a dialogue. Given the differences in outlook and loyalties separating most Marxists and most Wittgensteinians\xE2\x80\x94the differences briefly summarized at the beginning of this review\xE2\x80\x94it seems unlikely that this collection of attempts to forge links between Wittgenstein and Marxism will have any more impact on \xE2\x80\x9Cdominant understandings of Marx or Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x9D (Kitching, 11) than the surprisingly large number of previous attempts to do so, a tradition that already includes a number of books (Manser 1973, Rubinstein 1981, Easton 1983, Kitching 1988, Pleasants 1999) and many more journal articles.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>However, that would be an overly narrow way to answer the question of the potential impact of this book. Pleasants provides a helpful framework here, distinguishing three broad kinds of attempts at relating Marx and Wittgenstein (161). First, there are accounts that try to show that Marx influenced Wittgenstein, either through Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s reading of specific texts of Marx, or via some intermediary. As Pleasants notes, these projects are a familiar, and fairly limited, kind of intellectual history. Furthermore, given the very scanty evidence, they will always seem speculative at best, wishful thinking at worst. Second, there are interpretations that argue for some similarity, or parallel, between certain aspects of their views, a \xE2\x80\x9Cconventional scholarly exercise in textual interpretation and theoretical construction\xE2\x80\x9D (161). The principal problem with this approach, as T. E. Wilkerson unkindly but pithily observes in his review of another \xE2\x80\x9CWittgenstein and . . . \xE2\x80\x9C project, is that \xE2\x80\x9Cany two philosophers are similar in some respect, but there is often little profit in dwelling on the similarity.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> \t\t</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Third, there are writers who go further afield than the historians and the drawers of similarities. Typically, they use methods or ideas derived from one thinker to reconstruct the other, or draw on both for social and political criticism. It is this project\xE2\x80\x94making use of Marx and Wittgenstein, rather than interpreting them\xE2\x80\x94that is encapsulated in the epigraph to Rossi-Landi\xE2\x80\x99s contribution: \xE2\x80\x9CDo not seek for the <i>meaning</i> of a philosopher, seek for his use: the meaning of a philosopher is his use in the culture.\xE2\x80\x9D (Pleasants, 161; Rossi-Landi, 185) These parts of this collection, those that go beyond the letter of what Marx and Wittgenstein had to say, are the ones that have the greatest promise and will hold the most interest for a readership extending beyond those specializing in Marx and Wittgenstein. Indeed, the particular topics discussed in this book are connected with a number of broader currents of contemporary thought. For there is a renewed interest at present in bringing together Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s contribution to a critique of traditional philosophy, and his emphasis on bringing words home to their ordinary uses, on the one hand, and a radical, or liberatory, ethics and politics, on the other. Three collections of new essays that exemplify these developments are <i>The Legacy of Wittgenstein: Pragmatism or Deconstruction</i> (ed. Ludwig Nagl and Chantal Mouffe; Peter Lang, 2001); <i>Slow Cures and Bad Philosophers: Essays on Wittgenstein, Medicine and Bioethics</i> (ed. Carl Elliott; Duke University Press, 2001) and <i>Feminist Interpretations of Ludwig Wittgenstein</i> (ed. Naomi Scheman and Peg O\xE2\x80\x99Connor; Pennsylvania State University Press, 2002).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Furthermore, there is a strikingly autobiographical dimension to many of the essays in this collection; taken together, they cast light on the Nietzschean idea that \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy is always autobiography\xE2\x80\x9D (Fann, 282). In contrast to most professional philosophy, which aspires to read as if written from nowhere, many contributors tell us about the relationship between their professional and personal lives and the ideas they discuss. Carver\xE2\x80\x99s insightful essay draws our attention to the need that readers have to construct an authorial persona when reading Wittgenstein or Marx, a characterization of the \xE2\x80\x9Cwho, when and why of writing it,\xE2\x80\x9D in order to understand what the author wrote. Carver notes that we do not only have to be able to tell a story about what motivated Marx and Wittgenstein in order to interpret what they wrote. The same point about emplotment \xE2\x80\x9Ccertainly applies to the way that interpretations of texts by Marx and Wittgenstein are constructed by commentators . . . Readers thus have the job of learning about commentators <i>as authors</i> when reading <i>their</i> texts, as well as learning about Marx and Wittgenstein when reading theirs\xE2\x80\x9D (96). Similarly, we readers of <i>Marx and Wittgenstein</i> have the job of learning about the contributors to the volume <i>as</i> \t\t\t<i>authors</i> when reading <i>their</i> texts. One of the pleasures of this book is the willingness of a number of authors to tell us about how their personal, political, and philosophical lives are related. Part of what we learn from their autobiographical stories is the moral seriousness of their interpretations of Marx and Wittgenstein: the sense of elation felt on discovering that they could reconcile certain views, or their distress at finding that certain aspects of one or the other\xE2\x80\x99s thought had to be rejected. We also learn that the most interesting connections between Marx and Wittgenstein that the book draws are neither historical connections between those two figures, nor systematic parallels between their thought, but rather the connections that have been forged by their readers.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

He first considers Volosinov and Bakhtin as anticipators of Wittgenstein, then turns to a critique of Rossi-Landi\xE2\x80\x99s reading of Wittgenstein, and ends by recommending Markus\xE2\x80\x99 use of Wittgenstein in developing a contemporary Marxist philosophy of language.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Part VI, \xE2\x80\x9CKnowledge, morality and politics\xE2\x80\x9D reprises the subtitle of the book and promises the most direct engagement with the aim of showing how the encounter between Marx and Wittgenstein can be philosophically productive. Kitching\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CMarxism and reflectivity\xE2\x80\x9D approaches the question of whether Marxism is a science by way of a highly critical reading of Wright, Levine, and Sober\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Reconstructing Marxism</i>. He identifies the leading failure of that book as a lack of reflexivity, the very reflexivity that Kitching identifies as central to both Marx\xE2\x80\x99s and Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s approach to understanding practice. Read\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CMarx and Wittgenstein on vampires and parasites\xE2\x80\x9D draws parallels between Wittgenstein on the relationship between the language of everyday and philosophical language, and Marx\xE2\x80\x99s account of exploitation in capitalism. Finally, Fann\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CBeyond Marx and Wittgenstein (A confession of a Wittgensteinian Marxist turned Taoist)\xE2\x80\x9D provides an apt autobiographical conclusion. It tells the story of his journey from postwar Taiwan to the US in search of a rational faith, his combination of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s critique of metaphysics with Marxism-Leninism\xE2\x80\x99s critique of capitalism, his proselytizing support for Mao\xE2\x80\x99s Cultural Revolution, his rediscovery of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s anti-scientism after the collapse of communism, and his Taoist rejection of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s and Marx\xE2\x80\x99s demanding ideals in favor of a life lived as an end in itself, not as a means to an end.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>To what extent, then, will the book as a whole realize its editors\xE2\x80\x99 hopes that bringing Marx and Wittgenstein together in this way will lead to an open, intense, and honest \xE2\x80\x9Cdialogue both among and between Marxists and Wittgensteinians\xE2\x80\x9D (xv)? That depends, to a very large extent, on how one conceives of such a dialogue. Given the differences in outlook and loyalties separating most Marxists and most Wittgensteinians\xE2\x80\x94the differences briefly summarized at the beginning of this review\xE2\x80\x94it seems unlikely that this collection of attempts to forge links between Wittgenstein and Marxism will have any more impact on \xE2\x80\x9Cdominant understandings of Marx or Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x9D (Kitching, 11) than the surprisingly large number of previous attempts to do so, a tradition that already includes a number of books (Manser 1973, Rubinstein 1981, Easton 1983, Kitching 1988, Pleasants 1999) and many more journal articles.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>However, that would be an overly narrow way to answer the question of the potential impact of this book. Pleasants provides a helpful framework here, distinguishing three broad kinds of attempts at relating Marx and Wittgenstein (161). First, there are accounts that try to show that Marx influenced Wittgenstein, either through Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s reading of specific texts of Marx, or via some intermediary. As Pleasants notes, these projects are a familiar, and fairly limited, kind of intellectual history. Furthermore, given the very scanty evidence, they will always seem speculative at best, wishful thinking at worst. Second, there are interpretations that argue for some similarity, or parallel, between certain aspects of their views, a \xE2\x80\x9Cconventional scholarly exercise in textual interpretation and theoretical construction\xE2\x80\x9D (161). The principal problem with this approach, as T. E. Wilkerson unkindly but pithily observes in his review of another \xE2\x80\x9CWittgenstein and . . . \xE2\x80\x9C project, is that \xE2\x80\x9Cany two philosophers are similar in some respect, but there is often little profit in dwelling on the similarity.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> \t\t</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Third, there are writers who go further afield than the historians and the drawers of similarities. Typically, they use methods or ideas derived from one thinker to reconstruct the other, or draw on both for social and political criticism. It is this project\xE2\x80\x94making use of Marx and Wittgenstein, rather than interpreting them\xE2\x80\x94that is encapsulated in the epigraph to Rossi-Landi\xE2\x80\x99s contribution: \xE2\x80\x9CDo not seek for the <i>meaning</i> of a philosopher, seek for his use: the meaning of a philosopher is his use in the culture.\xE2\x80\x9D (Pleasants, 161; Rossi-Landi, 185) These parts of this collection, those that go beyond the letter of what Marx and Wittgenstein had to say, are the ones that have the greatest promise and will hold the most interest for a readership extending beyond those specializing in Marx and Wittgenstein. Indeed, the particular topics discussed in this book are connected with a number of broader currents of contemporary thought. For there is a renewed interest at present in bringing together Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s contribution to a critique of traditional philosophy, and his emphasis on bringing words home to their ordinary uses, on the one hand, and a radical, or liberatory, ethics and politics, on the other. Three collections of new essays that exemplify these developments are <i>The Legacy of Wittgenstein: Pragmatism or Deconstruction</i> (ed. Ludwig Nagl and Chantal Mouffe; Peter Lang, 2001); <i>Slow Cures and Bad Philosophers: Essays on Wittgenstein, Medicine and Bioethics</i> (ed. Carl Elliott; Duke University Press, 2001) and <i>Feminist Interpretations of Ludwig Wittgenstein</i> (ed. Naomi Scheman and Peg O\xE2\x80\x99Connor; Pennsylvania State University Press, 2002).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Furthermore, there is a strikingly autobiographical dimension to many of the essays in this collection; taken together, they cast light on the Nietzschean idea that \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy is always autobiography\xE2\x80\x9D (Fann, 282). In contrast to most professional philosophy, which aspires to read as if written from nowhere, many contributors tell us about the relationship between their professional and personal lives and the ideas they discuss. Carver\xE2\x80\x99s insightful essay draws our attention to the need that readers have to construct an authorial persona when reading Wittgenstein or Marx, a characterization of the \xE2\x80\x9Cwho, when and why of writing it,\xE2\x80\x9D in order to understand what the author wrote. Carver notes that we do not only have to be able to tell a story about what motivated Marx and Wittgenstein in order to interpret what they wrote. The same point about emplotment \xE2\x80\x9Ccertainly applies to the way that interpretations of texts by Marx and Wittgenstein are constructed by commentators . . . Readers thus have the job of learning about commentators <i>as authors</i> when reading <i>their</i> texts, as well as learning about Marx and Wittgenstein when reading theirs\xE2\x80\x9D (96). Similarly, we readers of <i>Marx and Wittgenstein</i> have the job of learning about the contributors to the volume <i>as</i> \t\t\t<i>authors</i> when reading <i>their</i> texts. One of the pleasures of this book is the willingness of a number of authors to tell us about how their personal, political, and philosophical lives are related. Part of what we learn from their autobiographical stories is the moral seriousness of their interpretations of Marx and Wittgenstein: the sense of elation felt on discovering that they could reconcile certain views, or their distress at finding that certain aspects of one or the other\xE2\x80\x99s thought had to be rejected. We also learn that the most interesting connections between Marx and Wittgenstein that the book draws are neither historical connections between those two figures, nor systematic parallels between their thought, but rather the connections that have been forged by their readers.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
