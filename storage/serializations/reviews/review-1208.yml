content: "<p>This most welcome publication of Werner Pluhar\xE2\x80\x99s translation of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i> completes his translation of the three main texts of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s critical system. Pluhar is a veteran and highly accomplished translator whose work consistently has exhibited an equal mastery of German and English as well as the arguments of the texts he has translated. Those who have profited from his earlier translations of the First and (especially) Third <i>Critiques</i> will not be disappointed with this text. The translation is remarkably consistent, highly readable\xE2\x80\x94in this respect, in this reviewer\xE2\x80\x99s judgment, an advance on the Beck and Gregor translations (for the Gregor translation I refer to the recent 1997 Cambridge University Press edition)\xE2\x80\x94and exceptionally well edited (I found only a single typographical error in the entire text: \xE2\x80\x9Cinstrutive\xE2\x80\x9D for \xE2\x80\x9Cinstructive\xE2\x80\x9D on page 52). Accompanying the text is a fine introduction (by Stephen Engstrom), an extensive glossary (ten pages), a twenty-seven-page bibliography, and an index (the final three not found in the Beck and Gregor editions).</p>  \n\
  <p>Pluhar appears to view the task of the translator as follows: provide the reader with an as linguistically and philosophically accurate, smooth, and readable rendering as possible while keeping the reader, when advisable, close to the original German. In both respects, Pluhar succeeds admirably. Contributing in no small measure to this success is his consistent practice of providing justification for <i>every</i> controversial or difficult rendering of words and expressions, particularly when the translation departs from the Beck or (especially) Gregor editions. I found myself agreeing with Pluhar on almost every occasion, and some of his \xE2\x80\x9Ccorrections\xE2\x80\x9D of the Gregor translation are, in this reviewer\xE2\x80\x99s judgment, important.</p>  \n\
  <p>For instance, Gregor follows many translators in rendering <i>Verm\xC3\xB6gen</i> as \xE2\x80\x9Cfaculty\xE2\x80\x9D and thus <i>Begehrungsverm\xC3\xB6gen</i> as \xE2\x80\x9Cfaculty of desire.\xE2\x80\x9D Translations of other late eighteenth century texts often have followed this lead (e.g. Albert Blackwell in his highly regarded translation of Schleiermacher\xE2\x80\x99s unpublished and unfinished treatise <i>\xC3\x9Cber die Freiheit</i>, Edwin Mellen Press, 1992). And yet, \xE2\x80\x9Cfaculty\xE2\x80\x9D is a highly misleading equivalent for <i>Verm\xC3\xB6gen</i>, and not simply because \xE2\x80\x9Cfaculty\xE2\x80\x9D intimates an association with faculty psychology. \xE2\x80\x9CFaculty\xE2\x80\x9D suggests an entity or mechanism that executes a given function, whereas <i>Verm\xC3\xB6gen</i> indicates a capacity, power, or ability. \xE2\x80\x9CFaculty\xE2\x80\x9D thus omits the focus on the activity of autonomous moral agency associated with the entire subject and thus fails to capture the pro-active nature of practical rationality wherein reason itself is the motivational force in human action. The later Fichte uses <i>Verm\xC3\xB6gen</i> similarly to express one\xE2\x80\x99s power or ability to become an image of the divine and connects this with one\xE2\x80\x99s general ability to be self-formative (he attempts to capture the immediacy of this power of self-formative activity with the term <i>Sein-K\xC3\xB6nnen</i> which he ties directly to <i>Verm\xC3\xB6gen</i>). With one exception (139) where \xE2\x80\x9Cability\xE2\x80\x9D is preferable (the alternative \xE2\x80\x9Cpower\xE2\x80\x9D is acknowledge in footnote), Pluhar uses \xE2\x80\x9Cpower\xE2\x80\x9D and thus renders <i>Begehrungsverm\xC3\xB6gen</i> as \xE2\x80\x9Cpower of desire.\xE2\x80\x9D Related to this translation of <i>Verm\xC3\xB6gen</i> is Pluhar\xE2\x80\x99s choice of \xE2\x80\x9Cpower of choice\xE2\x80\x9D as the equivalent for <i>Willk\xC3\xBChr</i> (Gregor uses \xE2\x80\x9Cchoice\xE2\x80\x9D exclusively) in contexts where there is a contrast with \xE2\x80\x9Cpower of desire\xE2\x80\x9D and thus <i>Verm\xC3\xB6gen</i> is implied. This reviewer judges these changes to be most welcome and overdue correctives.</p>  \n\
  <p>The translation of these standard terms not only is more consistent with what Kant means but also brings the reader closer to the original text. Consider, similarly, a few additional examples. Gregor almost exclusively translates both <i>Empfindung</i> and <i>Gef\xC3\xBChl</i> with the generic \xE2\x80\x9Cfeeling\xE2\x80\x9D, thereby in some instances obscuring, as Pluhar correctly indicates, subtle distinctions Kant intends to make. For instance, Kant sometimes maintains that pleasure informs practical reasoning only to the extent that one can <i>sense</i>\xE2\x80\x94that is, with one or more senses\xE2\x80\x94the gratification one will receive from a certain desirable object. If one renders <i>Empfindung</i> in these contexts as \xE2\x80\x9Cfeeling\xE2\x80\x9D, one does not capture with the same poignancy the sharp distinction between rational and non-rational determining grounds of the will. Though Kant often (and much more often than not) uses <i>Empfindung</i> and <i>Gef\xC3\xBChl</i> interchangeably (as Pluhar notes), Pluhar\xE2\x80\x99s decision to preserve for the reader Kant\xE2\x80\x99s terminological distinctions when applicable is well advised and, as I have stressed, keeps the reader close to the precise meaning of the German original. Note also in this regard Pluhar\xE2\x80\x99s translation of <i>Bewegursache</i> as \xE2\x80\x9Cmotivating cause\xE2\x80\x9D, as opposed to simply \xE2\x80\x9Cmotive\xE2\x80\x9D, in contexts in which Kant discusses causes.</p>  \n\
  <p>Pluhar\xE2\x80\x99s meticulous effort to justify or argue for controversial translations, renderings of opaque passages, and departures from previous translations makes for a highly annotated text in marked contrast to Gregor\xE2\x80\x99s and Beck\xE2\x80\x99s far more economic use of annotations and references. Add explanations of historical references (sometimes quite obscure and difficult to track down) in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s text and Pluhar\xE2\x80\x99s extensive cross-references to the First <i>Critique</i>, the <i>Groundwork</i>, and the <i>Metaphysics of Morals</i>\xE2\x80\x94the first missing altogether in the Beck and Gregor editions and the other two used by them much more sparingly\xE2\x80\x94and the footnotes accumulate quickly. In all, there are nine hundred eighty six footnote references to the translation. Some readers no doubt will find this excessive and a distraction, which, if not simply ignored, makes an otherwise reader-friendly translation cumbersome to work through. I think, however, that this assessment should be resisted. The payoff far exceeds any annoyance to the reader.</p>  \n\
  <p>The extensive cross-references to other works of Kant provide a good study guide for those whose knowledge of Kant is less than that of a seasoned scholar. Identification of Latin roots for some Kantian terminology informs the reader when certain expressions have legal connections or connotations. Furthermore, supplying the German original for certain terms and expressions offers a reader with some command of German a guideline for deciding when it might be necessary to refer back to the original German text and the context in which the term or expression appeared. Those returning to the German text along with the translation are also aided by Pluhar\xE2\x80\x99s occasional clarification of obscure pronoun antecedents, especially when a proper English rendering requires some departure from the German (as noted, in all instances Pluhar argues thoroughly for these departures). In sum, this reviewer does not find the use of footnote references over-indulgent; on the contrary, they contribute to the overall effective study of the text.</p>  \n\
  <p>As noted above, Stephen Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s introduction accompanies the translation. Since the publisher has an admirable tradition of marketing relatively inexpensive editions of philosophical classics for classroom and general use, the introduction is an important component of the overall success of the book. Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s introduction is very clearly presented and readable\xE2\x80\x94his examples, in my judgment, consistently helpful\xE2\x80\x94especially for the undergraduate who has some grasp of modern philosophy and thus some familiarity with Kant. As expected, Engstrom attempts to set the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i> in the context of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory (that is, its relation both to the <i>Groundwork</i> and the <i>Metaphysics of Morals</i>) and of the critique of metaphysics carried out in the First <i>Critique</i>. Engstrom attempts to initiate the reader by means of a distinct point of entry into the text, one that becomes an organizational theme for his introduction and one that contrasts with Andrews Reath\xE2\x80\x99s introduction to the Gregor translation. This reviewer does not judge Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s introduction as significantly superior or inferior to Reath\xE2\x80\x99s, but the orientation and emphases are clearly different. If one relies upon introductions to texts for classroom use, one should be aware of the Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s and Reath\xE2\x80\x99s contrasting approaches to the Second <i>Critique</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>Suppose one teaches an advanced undergraduate course on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s ethics or, better, a course on practical rationality and freedom in which one chooses to devote a unit to the Kantian position. In these cases, I recommend the Reath introduction over Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s for the simple reason that Reath concentrates on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theory of rational agency as the organizing principle for introducing Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory. His background discussion of <i>Kritik</i> is accordingly set in the context of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s attempt to establish the basic principles of practical rationality. As a result, there are closer inspections than the reader receives from Engstrom of Theorems I-III and of the way in which Kant explains how reason can be a genuine motivational force in human decision and action.</p>  \n\
  <p>Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s introduction attempts to situate the Second <i>Critique</i> in the broader scope of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s critique of traditional metaphysics and his attempt to reconstitute a foundation for metaphysics. This theme is evident early in the introduction as Engstrom places Kant\xE2\x80\x99s central question\xE2\x80\x94can reason determine the will directly?\xE2\x80\x94in the context of whether reason of itself can be a source of practical <i>knowledge</i>. As such, Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s piece has, in my judgment, a wider appeal, not only an as orientation to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theory of practical rationality and the foundation for morality, but also to the role of the Second <i>Critique</i> in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s work as a systematic philosopher. To this end, Engstrom provides a more comprehensive assessment of the First <i>Critique</i> background than does Reath, and notably gives far more attention to the historical sources of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory and the historical debates between rationalists and sentimentalists Kant attempts to resolve (Reath, for instance, ignores Leibnizian perfectionism presumably because that moral theory was seen by Kant to have an impoverished moral psychology and thus to offer little that might inform a theory of agency). The attention to historical background, concisely and effectively summarized by Engstrom, is a helpful aid to the less initiated reader and, in this reviewer\xE2\x80\x99s judgment, important. An additional asset is that the student can more readily discern that Kant is attempting to overcome <i>two</i> forms of reductionism (rationalism and sentimentalism) along with two forms of skepticism about the rational foundation for morality (skepticism about rationalism being associated with standard suspicion about moral perfectionism and its theistic underpinning). Engstrom captures these themes quite well. Finally, Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s approach results in a more comprehensive presentation of the role of the ideas of reason in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral theory and critical philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>In sum, this reviewer highly recommends this translation. Its achievement can be placed easily alongside Pluhar\xE2\x80\x99s earlier very successful Kant translations. The bibliography, essential for classroom use, is well edited, and the glossary provides a concise introduction to a translator\xE2\x80\x99s general approach to the text. I find Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s introduction to be a thorough and effective balance of history and analysis, in short, a fine piece of work. Those, particularly scholars of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s ethics, more interested in practical rationality and moral psychology likely will prefer the Reath introduction. Engstrom\xE2\x80\x99s piece, on the other hand, is preferable for a wider undergraduate audience.</p>"
