Relying heavily on this family correspondence as a constant point of reference for narrating and interpreting Jaspers's personal history, Kirkbright professes that she \"seeks to illuminate the connection between Jaspers's life and works.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>To this extent, she claims, \"his life can be seen in this biography to have been dedicated to illuminating the implications of truth with reference to the guiding light of reason\"(p.xx).
