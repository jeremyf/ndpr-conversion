  <p><em>Summary</em></p>  
  <p>The thesis of this book is that Hume holds a quasi-realist theory of causation.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is neither the realist about causation some interpreters (Strawson, Wright) see him as, nor the anti-realist others (Basson, Stroud) take him to be.<span>&nbsp; </span>If we read him as a quasi-realist, we can reconcile the seemingly contradictory passages on which these opposing interpretations are based and do not have to choose between them.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, we will see that Hume has a &quot;ready response to what is commonly thought to be an utterly devastating problem for [his] theory of causation,&quot; its alleged inability to distinguish between accidental and law-like regularities.</p>  
  <p>Of the one hundred and fifty pages of the book, the first seventy-five are taken up by a gallop through various forms of realism<span>&nbsp; </span>(causal, moral, scientific) and anti-realism (reductionism, constructivism, instrumentalism) in an attempt to develop a general -- &quot;topic-neutral&quot; -- characterization of these rival positions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Quasi-realism is then described as an &quot;intermediate alternative&quot; between realism and anti-realism. It consists in the endorsement of one of the theses traditionally associated with realism and the rejection of another.<span>&nbsp; </span>The first thesis is that, at least with respect to some domains of discourse, statements concerning the domain have truth-values and that some of them are, in fact, true.<span>&nbsp; </span>The second is that these true statements are true in virtue of some objective properties of the entities in the domain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anti-realists deny both theses.<span>&nbsp; </span>A quasi-realist affirms the first, but not the second.</p>  
  <p>The second half of the book is devoted to showing that Hume&#39;s &quot;theory of causation&quot; is a version of quasi-realism.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are told that Hume &quot;recognizes causal judgments as genuine propositions, susceptible to truth and falsehood&quot; and that he thinks that causal judgments made by the &quot;delicate causalist&quot; are true.<span>&nbsp; </span>What this means is that in &quot;an ideal causal network&quot; (that is, the careful and experienced causal reasoner&#39;s &quot;general view about how the features of the world are causally related to each other&quot;), the &quot;connections . . . are an accurate representation of the causal connections . . . in the world.&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>The possession of such an ideal causal network comes about through practice, in particular, through developing the habit of adhering to general rules. </p>  
  <p><em>Problems</em></p>  
  <p>1) <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not altogether clear just what it is Hume is supposed to be a quasi-realist about.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is talk of Hume&#39;s theory of causation, of course, and also much of his analysis of causation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Neither of these labels suggest anything very Humean.<span>&nbsp; </span>The central questions in his &quot;new science of man&quot; have to do with how the mind acquires its contents and what it does with those contents.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hume&#39;s analysis of <em>our idea</em> of causation is that it has three components, the ideas of contiguity, temporal priority and necessary connection.<span>&nbsp; </span>Searching for the source of these component ideas in experience, he finds the third elusive.<span>&nbsp; </span>He then offers an account of causal inference as a &quot;species of sensation,&quot; rather than as a product of reason.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Rather confusingly, he also uses &#39;causal reasoning&#39; as a label for this kind of non-rational inference.)
