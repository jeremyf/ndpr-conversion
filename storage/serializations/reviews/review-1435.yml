content: "<p>I remember Ronald Bogue\xE2\x80\x99s first book, <i>Deleuze and Guattari</i>, published in 1989. For those of us who study Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s work, it was an intellectual event: the first book on Deleuze in English. That book is a clear, concise overview of Deleuze and Guattari\xE2\x80\x99s work, and its appearance seemed somehow an important step in conferring intellectual legitimacy on the study of Deleuze. More recently, Bogue has completed a magisterial three-volume study dedicated to Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s treatment of film, literature, and music and the arts.</p>  \n\
  <p>This book, <i>Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s Wake</i>, is of a different character from either the early overview or the more recent detailed studies. As the title indicates, it was put together as a tribute of sorts to Deleuze. The book comprises eight articles, seven of them previously published, concerning Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s work. The first three fall under the subtitle of <i>tributes</i>, while the others are the aptly named <i>tributaries</i>. These latter are applications of Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s philosophical framework to a variety of cultural issues. If we may parse the book title\xE2\x80\x99s pun this way, the first part is a wake in the sense of a remembrance (even though two of the three articles in this section were written before Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s death), while the second part consists of writings in the wake created by Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s thought.</p>  \n\
  <p>The tributes are of three different types, but all of them offer frameworks for thinking about Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy as a whole. The first, \xE2\x80\x9CDeleuze\xE2\x80\x99s Style,\xE2\x80\x9D takes Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s claim that Spinoza has three lines running through the <i>Ethics</i>\xE2\x80\x94an aqueous line of definitions and deductions, a volcanic line of fire in the scholia, and an aerial line in the final sections\xE2\x80\x94and applies them to Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s own work. Deleuze, too, has a systematic line of terms, definitions, and relations; a volcanic line of rhetoric; and an ethereal line of abstract flights that appear periodically throughout his work. The first lies in the disciplined framework of his concepts. The second emerges periodically when he steps away from that framework to offer flashes of singular insight or critique. (My own favorite flash is in <i>Dialogues</i>, where Deleuze notes that the study of the history of philosophy acts as a police mechanism to silence people who haven\xE2\x80\x99t read X\xE2\x80\x99s book on Y\xE2\x80\x99s treatment of Z\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy.) The third line often appears, with Deleuze as with Spinoza, near the end of his texts. It involves conceptual flights that are difficult to follow but seem often to gesture at a space of creativity or freedom that lies just beyond our reach.</p>  \n\
  <p>Bogue\xE2\x80\x99s second essay asks the question of whether Deleuze can be characterized as a postmodern philosopher. He answers that question mostly in the positive, noting that Deleuze, particularly in his later work with Guattari, resists the temptation to offer grand narratives and instead writes in more specific areas, jettisoning earlier discussions of Being as difference for multiple and intersecting discussions that resist packaging into a coherent whole. One thinks here particularly of <i>A Thousand Plateaus</i>. Bogue\xE2\x80\x99s claim is suggestive, although I don\xE2\x80\x99t know how compelling. The concept of the postmodern is elusive, if indeed it is coherent, and Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s reluctance to appeal to the term (a reluctance Bogue notes) is a lead that perhaps should be followed. Not that there is nothing that might be characterized as postmodern in Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s work. But rather, the term itself does not bring us closer to understanding Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s writings.</p>  \n\
  <p>The third essay delves into Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation of Foucault\xE2\x80\x99s view of the subject in his book <i>Foucault</i>. Bogue argues that Deleuze is right to see in the Foucaultian subject a play of forces, and that the project of what Deleuze calls Thought, which is a more liberating intellectual activity in contrast to the conformism of knowledge, is itself a play of forces. Here Bogue reads Foucault, alongside Deleuze, through the lens of Nietzsche. For those of us, myself included, who would like to see a little more distance between Foucault and Nietzsche than Deleuze does, this essay stands as a challenge.</p>  \n\
  <p>These first three essays are not introductions to Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s thought. They presuppose some familiarity with Deleuzian texts. However, neither are they technical essays; they are more than strict exegetical analyses. Instead, they provide frameworks for thinking about the character and place of Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s thought. In that sense, they are useful both to those who have read Deleuze and wonder what to make of him as well as to those who have studied Deleuze more intensively and are interested in Bogue\xE2\x80\x99s take on the Deleuzian corpus as a whole.</p>  \n\
  <p>The second part of the book deals with specific areas in Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s thought: literature, music, film, television and drama, and religion. I find the article on music, \xE2\x80\x9CBecoming Metal, Becoming Death\xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D the most interesting, for a purely subjective reason: I would not have thought that death metal music could be interpreted in a Deleuzian way. However, Bogue, who seems to have a more than passing knowledge of death metal (who would have thought it?), makes a forceful case for it as, at least in its best moments, a type of Deleuzian becoming. There are several elements Bogue focuses on: death metal\xE2\x80\x99s volume as provoking an intensive experience, the lyrics as rejecting the conformism of more officially recognized types of popular music, the metal as creating a \xE2\x80\x9Csonic machine\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 91), the extremity of both sound and lyrics, and the music\xE2\x80\x99s speed (which, with Deleuze, he distinguishes from simple rapidity). If death metal can form a type of becoming, however, this raises the question of whether all becomings must, as Deleuze claims, pass through becoming-woman. Death metal, both the music and the audience for it, are overwhelmingly male-oriented. Bogue concludes, contra Deleuze, that there can be becomings that do not pass through becoming-woman.</p>  \n\
  <p>One wonders, reading this essay, whether death metal can be characterized as a <i>minority</i> in Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s sense of the term, a warping of the dominant (or majority) genre in order to create something new. Given death metal\xE2\x80\x99s emphasis on machismo, its homophobia and misogyny, one is tempted to say that death metal is not so much a minority form of music as a parody of majoritarian themes. If this is so, then it is unclear whether it can form a Deleuzian becoming, since becomings are all, for Deleuze, becoming-minor. (And, for Deleuze, all becomings-minor must pass through the first minority-becoming: becoming-woman.) Bogue has opened an interesting question, however, one worth pursuing in considering Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s thought.</p>  \n\
  <p>Bogue deals directly with the question of minority in the essay preceding \xE2\x80\x9CBecoming Metal, Becoming Death\xE2\x80\xA6,\xE2\x80\x9D entitled \xE2\x80\x9CMinor Writing and Minor Literature.\xE2\x80\x9D Here Bogue distinguishes Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s concept of a minor literature from that of many proponents of various identity studies. A minor literature is not, in Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s view, a literature written from the perspective of an oppressed group; nor is it secondary or neglected literature. Minor literature, of which Kafka would be a primary example, takes the language of the dominant culture and warps it to new purposes, creating what Deleuze calls \xE2\x80\x9Clines of flight.\xE2\x80\x9D As Bogue notes, for Deleuze this creation involves a certain kind of becoming: becoming-imperceptible. \xE2\x80\x9CBecoming-imperceptible is a process of elimination whereby one divests oneself of all coded identity and engages in the abstract lines of a nonorganic life, the immanent, virtual lines of continuous variation that play through discursive regimes of signs and nondiscursive machinic assemblages alike\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 73). In short, minor literature creates a type of living that is not merely a replication of dominant motifs but a process of touching on what Deleuze calls \xE2\x80\x9Cthe virtual.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \n\
  <p>The two following essays are on cinema and on television and Noh drama. In the first, Bogue unpacks the framework of Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s concepts in his two-volume study of cinema. He stresses the nonrepresentational character of cinematic signs that Deleuze embraces, and shows the Bergsonian perspective from which Deleuze writes. There are a number of recent studies of Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s work on the cinema, and this essay is as good a place as any to start coming to terms with that work. The next essay deals with Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s own essay on Samuel Beckett in <i>Essays Critical and Clinical</i>, showing the relation between Beckett\xE2\x80\x99s television plays and Noh drama.</p>  \n\
  <p>The volume\xE2\x80\x99s final essay, on religion, concerns the concept of betrayal. It takes the suggestion Deleuze and Guattari make in <i>A Thousand Plateaus</i>, that a postsignifying regime of signs involves a \xE2\x80\x9Cbetrayal of God,\xE2\x80\x9D in order to ask the question of what that betrayal might involve. In contrast to more theologically oriented writers, for whom the betrayal might be a matter of taking on the burden of someone else\xE2\x80\x99s betrayal (Bogue here appeals to J\xC3\xA9r\xC3\xB4me Lindon\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Jonah story), for Deleuze and Guattari this betrayal is a moment of liberation between two dominant signifying regimes. \xE2\x80\x9CThe passional, postsignifying regime may involve universal betrayal, but the moment of betrayal is itself a break in the regime, an uncoded and unmapped gap that is then recoded and remapped in terms of a specific configuration of power relations\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 160).</p>  \n\
  <p><i>Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s Wake</i> is not a single coherent narrative but a mixture of essays that offer a perspective on Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s work as a whole and others that focus on specific aspects of his work. Those who have read Bogue\xE2\x80\x99s work before and recognize him as one of the U.S.\xE2\x80\x99s foremost interpreters of Deleuze will not be disappointed here. Others, who have read Deleuze and are either wondering what to make of him or are interested in a critical engagement, will also find the book to be engaging. Bogue is, if his writings are any indication, Deleuzian to the core. However, to be Deleuzian is not merely to parrot Deleuze\xE2\x80\x99s words but to seek to use his perspective in order to create perspectives of one\xE2\x80\x99s own. Bogue\xE2\x80\x99s ability to do that is on full display in this book.</p>"
