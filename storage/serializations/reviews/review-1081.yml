  <p>(1) It seems to me that one need only read the Leiter report to discover its biases. I believe these biases exercise a constrictive effect on philosophical education in the United States.</p>  
  <p>(2) I think that most philosophers who can roughly be classified as &ldquo;analytic&rdquo; do stem in fact from the phenomenalist tradition initiated by Descartes and developed by the British Empiricists. I think that most such philosophers have been unable to distinguish phenomenalism from phenomenology&mdash;a crucial distinction. As Charles Peirce argued, phenomenology (what he termed phaneroscopy), is the first job of philosophy. (One can profitably consult Nicholas Capaldi, The Enlightenment Project in the Analytic Conversation.)</p>  
  <p>(3) I thank Professor Leiter for his reference to my The Primal Roots of American Philosophy in which I discuss shamanic healing, particularly in connection with William James&rsquo;s idea of pure experience.</p>
