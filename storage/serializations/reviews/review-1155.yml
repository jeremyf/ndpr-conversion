content: "<p>This book modestly labels itself \xE2\x80\x9Ca structural analysis of and commentary on the first book of [Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s] <i>Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (xvii), and as such it is certainly the fullest and most faithful one we possess, delivering greater insight into Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s intentions than similar works by Paul Ricoeur, Erazim Kohak, Andr\xC3\xA9 de Muralt, and others. Yet the stakes of this project are anything but modest. Rather, <i>Ideas I</i> (as it is commonly known in the literature) proves to be the key to the \xE2\x80\x9Cwhole of Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s thought\xE2\x80\x9D since it is its \xE2\x80\x9Cbeginning\xE2\x80\x9D (32) \xE2\x80\x93 not the first work Husserl wrote but the place where the single, fixed intention that governs Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s thought through all its phases finds an \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute\xE2\x80\x9D basis for its fulfillment (21). Marcus Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s central claim is that in <i>Ideas I</i> Husserl \xE2\x80\x9Cmakes the first and the last attempt at a complete, systematic presentation of phenomenology itself\xE2\x80\x9D (29), and that the beginning made here is refined, but never abandoned, in Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s later writings. Those familiar with recent Husserl-scholarship \xE2\x80\x93 which commonly reads <i>Ideas I</i> as a failed \xE2\x80\x9CCartesian\xE2\x80\x9D attempt to introduce phenomenology, one that Husserl himself increasingly rejected \xE2\x80\x93 will recognize just what a challenge Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s book represents.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Brainard is aware that his Husserl cuts a strange and unfashionable figure, but \xE2\x80\x9Cthe unpopularity of what Husserl actually thought\xE2\x80\x9D (27) is no excuse for turning it into something else. Indeed, one of the book\xE2\x80\x99s tasks is to rescue Husserlian thought from the \xE2\x80\x9Coblivion\xE2\x80\x9D (225) into which it has fallen at the hands of the \xE2\x80\x9Cphenom-enological movement\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 Heideg-ger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and more recent interpreters \xE2\x80\x93 which, under the guise of augmenting or developing the Husserlian project actually destroys and abandons it (219-225). The tool for this rescue attempt is provided by what Brainard (following Heribert Boeder) calls a \xE2\x80\x9Clogotecton-ic epoch\xC3\xA9\xE2\x80\x9D (xvi): By \xE2\x80\x9Cdetemporalizing or denatural-izing thought, by wresting it away from all temporal and natural continua\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 that is, by refusing to consider Husserl in light of contemporary or historical sources that may have influenced him, and by refusing to address questions to his thought that it does not pose to itself, however interesting they may be to <i>us</i> \xE2\x80\x93 the logotec-tonic epoch\xC3\xA9 discloses Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s thought as a \xE2\x80\x9Cstatic whole,\xE2\x80\x9D as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe unity of a preceding, regulative intention\xE2\x80\x9D (xvii). Whatever objections one might raise to the idea of such a logotec-tonic epoch\xC3\xA9 \xE2\x80\x93 and after several decades of hermeneutic criticism of intentionalism the reader will think of many \xE2\x80\x93 it cannot be denied that the aim of cultivating a \xE2\x80\x9Cradical reticence with respect to thought\xE2\x80\x9D and the ethos of taking Husserl \xE2\x80\x9Cat his word, listening all the while for its sense\xE2\x80\x9D (xvi) has paid off here. Brainard is able to show how the familiar concerns of phenomenology fit into a \xE2\x80\x9Csystem\xE2\x80\x9D whose elements have sometimes been noted but whose full scope has rarely been acknowledged. Whether this makes Husserl more attractive to contemporary readers is doubtful, but for Brainard irrelevant (225).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Drawing frequently on Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s letters and unpublished works, Brainard sketches the outlines of this system in Chapter One. Phenomenology is not as such philosophy, but a wholly new discipline that has the task of securing the foundation upon which \xE2\x80\x9Call subsequent knowledge and all human endeavor\xE2\x80\x9D (xiii) can be based. The need for it arises not from some dispute internal to the philosophical tradition \xE2\x80\x93 in fact it \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes not and, for principal reasons cannot, stand in any tradition\xE2\x80\x9D (14) \xE2\x80\x93 but from what Husserl calls the \xE2\x80\x9Ccrisis of reason,\xE2\x80\x9D the \xE2\x80\x9Clife and death struggle between belief and unbelief, between universal philosophy and scepticism\xE2\x80\x9D whose symptoms are found in naturalism, positivism, and objectivism. Only on a phenomenolog-ical basis can \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversal philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D eventually be achieved (7); Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s thought therefore has a system as its <i>goal</i>, not as its beginning. It is not a \xE2\x80\x9Cdeductive\xE2\x80\x9D system, not \xE2\x80\x9Csomething finished,\xE2\x80\x9D but an \xE2\x80\x9Cintuitive\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cfounded system\xE2\x80\x9D that operates between a \xE2\x80\x9Clowermost limit\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 the \xE2\x80\x9Cpure ego\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 and an \xE2\x80\x9Cuppermost limit\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute reason or God\xE2\x80\x9D (25). The task of thinking is to make a genuine beginning upon which, \xE2\x80\x9Cstone by stone,\xE2\x80\x9D it can build, over generations, toward the knowledge of that which is \xE2\x80\x9Chighest\xE2\x80\x9D and therefore \xE2\x80\x9Cthe ground, the root of everything\xE2\x80\x9D (23-24). In this, phenomenology mirrors the essence of the <i>animale rationale</i>, whose life is striving toward the <i>telos</i> of increasing rationalization (15). Because \xE2\x80\x9Call life is position-taking\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 that is, <i>belief</i> \xE2\x80\x93 and therefore \xE2\x80\x9Csubject to an ought [<i>Sollen</i>]\xE2\x80\x9D (15), the poles of the system are built into the very essence of life; a crisis of belief thus becomes a life-and-death matter.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The belief at issue here is not <i>pistis</i>, faith, but <i>doxa</i>, something far more basic that characterizes our overall stance in the world, the \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural attitude.\xE2\x80\x9D If a scientific path toward knowledge of God is to be found, it must pass through a mode of belief that cannot be shaken. Though belief in the world might appear to satisfy this condition, Husserl is convinced that it does not, and Brainard devotes Chapter Two to the hotly contested sections of <i>Ideas I</i> in which Husserl attempts to motivate this claim and delimit a kind of belief that in fact satisfies the condition. This requires clarification of two mainstays of phenomenolog-ical method \xE2\x80\x93 the eidetic reduction and the epoch\xC3\xA9 \xE2\x80\x93 and since Brainard argues that Husserl never wavered in the principles of his method (58), his interpretation amounts to the unfashionable claim that Husserl remained strongly \xE2\x80\x9Cessential-ist\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cfoundationalist.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Concerning the eidetic reduction Brainard cogently lays out Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s argument that all factual, empirical sciences presuppose \xE2\x80\x9Csciences of essence\xE2\x80\x9D since empirical claims depend on conceptual necessities that cannot be derived from experience. Without the possibility of such knowledge, according to Husserl, science must ultimately fall victim to scepticism; but a merely logical, or argumentative, treatment of this problem oscillates endlessly between sceptical denial and dogmatic circularity. Thus Husserl invokes his \xE2\x80\x9Cprinciple of all principles\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 namely, the absolute right, as a source of justification, of what presents itself in intuitive <i>Evidenz</i>. By that standard, essences (necessities) are just as intuitable as are empirical things, and phenomenology \xE2\x80\x93 which is to be a \xE2\x80\x9Cfirst\xE2\x80\x9D science and therefore an eidetic one \xE2\x80\x93 will proceed by intuition. However, to say that phenomenology is an eidetic science is not yet to specify its distinctive field of investigation. For this a \xE2\x80\x9Csecond reduction\xE2\x80\x9D is needed, one that \xE2\x80\x9Cprovides eidetic inquiry with its absolute ground, its direction, its sense\xE2\x80\x9D (36). This role is played by the epoch\xC3\xA9.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s careful elucidation of the epoch\xC3\xA9 and its motivation centers on the status of belief. In an elaborate series of reflections Husserl tries to show that our ordinary \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural attitude\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x9Cthe posit of or belief in the existence of the world\xE2\x80\x9D (60), a belief that is \xE2\x80\x9Cunique and decisive\xE2\x80\x9D (61) because it enters into each belief directed toward things <i>in</i> the world \xE2\x80\x93 can and must be superseded in favor of a \xE2\x80\x9Cphenomenological attitude\xE2\x80\x9D that reveals an epistemically prior and absolutely grounding \xE2\x80\x9Cpure consciousness.\xE2\x80\x9D Starting with the character of belief as such, Husserl unpacks Descartes\xE2\x80\x99 notion of universal doubt to show that a certain \xE2\x80\x9Cmodification\xE2\x80\x9D of believing consciousness is always possible \xE2\x80\x93 not one in which I <i>doubt</i> what I previously believed, but one in which I put that belief \xE2\x80\x9Cout of play,\xE2\x80\x9D make no epistemic use of it, though it remains my belief so long as I have no reason to transform it into doubt. The epoch\xC3\xA9 is such a \xE2\x80\x9Cneutralization of belief.\xE2\x80\x9D But while <i>any</i> belief or set of beliefs can be neutralized, Brainard notes that a truly universal epoch\xC3\xA9 would not serve Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s purpose, since it would leave no \xE2\x80\x9Cunmodified\xE2\x80\x9D region of belief upon which to establish a science of phenomenology (67-8). Why, then, does Husserl choose specifically to apply it to the \xE2\x80\x9Cgeneral thesis\xE2\x80\x9D of world-belief? Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s text \xE2\x80\x93 and so Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s commentary \xE2\x80\x93 is none too clear on this matter, but it is because Husserl understands world-belief in terms of a contrast between \xE2\x80\x9Ctranscendent\xE2\x80\x9D perception (in which consciousness grasps what is other than it) and \xE2\x80\x9Cimmanent\xE2\x80\x9D perception (in which consciousness grasps itself) and holds that neutralizing all transcendent (or worldly) belief will leave a sphere of immanent perception, or \xE2\x80\x9Cpure consciousness,\xE2\x80\x9D as a \xE2\x80\x9Cphenomenological residuum.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Even if we grant such a distinction, however, why should pure consciousness be of particular interest to one seeking an absolute foundation for philosophy? Here Brainard leads us through the maze of paragraphs in which Husserl argues that what is perceived immanently not merely survives the epoch\xC3\xA9 of world-belief, but is a region of \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute being,\xE2\x80\x9D whereas the world has a merely \xE2\x80\x9Crelative being\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 indeed, is \xE2\x80\x9Cnothing at all\xE2\x80\x9D beyond \xE2\x80\x9Csomething presented or something apparent in the manner peculiar to consciousness\xE2\x80\x9D (98). The key here, as Brainard points out, is Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s <i>epistemic</i> claim that no transcendent perception excludes the possible non-existence of its object, whereas the existence of the object of immanent perception \xE2\x80\x9Ccannot be doubted without leading to a countersense\xE2\x80\x9D (90). For Husserl, this epistemic difference seems to authorize an essential <i>ontological</i> distinction between consciousness and world, and further, an essential dependence of the latter on the former. </p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The nature of this dependence is the crux of all debates over the character of Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cidealism,\xE2\x80\x9D and though Brainard practices \xE2\x80\x9Creticence\xE2\x80\x9D with respect to such debates, his reconstruction has implications for them. For instance, he (279) explicitly rejects the view \xE2\x80\x93 advocated by J. N. Mohanty and others \xE2\x80\x93 that pure consciousness is not a region of \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute being\xE2\x80\x9D but the ontologically neutral terrain of <i>Sinn</i> \xE2\x80\x93 a \xE2\x80\x9Cregion of sense\xE2\x80\x9D as Brainard himself calls it (101) \xE2\x80\x93 in which all modes of \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing\xE2\x80\x9D are constituted. Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation depends, however, on the claim that the neutralization of belief carried out in the epoch\xC3\xA9 is an \xE2\x80\x9Cannihiliation\xE2\x80\x9D (69) of the world in the same ontological sense in which Husserl speaks of a conceivable \xE2\x80\x9Cannihilation of the world of physical things\xE2\x80\x9D in which the \xE2\x80\x9Cexistence [of consciousness] would not be touched\xE2\x80\x9D (Husserl, cited by Brainard, 97). Yet these are arguably two very different things. Nor is the fact that Husserl uses the term \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute being\xE2\x80\x9D decisive here, since earlier drafts (and the published text itself) make it clear that the term is equivalent to \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute <i>givenness</i>.\xE2\x80\x9D One reason for Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s insistence on a strong ontological reading does, however, emerge in Chapter Three, where he presents Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s attempt, following the application of the epoch\xC3\xA9, to lay out the main elements of the \xE2\x80\x9Clowermost limit of the system,\xE2\x80\x9D the field of pure consciousness.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Though occasionally this chapter lapses from clarifying commentary to something closer to paraphrase, in general it provides valuable guidance for approaching difficult topics such as intentional-ity, noesis/noema, modalization, synthesis (constitution), and expression. Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s numerous and minute distinctions are expertly analyzed, and though the logotecto-nic method means that where Husserl is ambiguous so Brainard will be (for instance, on the question of whether the noema is some sort of representation or abstract entity), there are exciting and surprising insights throughout. One of these is Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s argument \xE2\x80\x93 again, an unfashionable one \xE2\x80\x93 that the \xE2\x80\x9Cpure ego\xE2\x80\x9D remains the \xE2\x80\x9CArchimedian point\xE2\x80\x9D (3) of phenomenology. Recent work in Husserl-studies has tended to downplay the importance of the egological level of constitution in favor of the supposedly more \xE2\x80\x9Cprimordial\xE2\x80\x9D pre-egological level of passivity, affectivity, embodiment, and the temporal streaming of experience itself. Brainard, in contrast, argues that in the absence of an ego in terms of which a distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cactional\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cpotential\xE2\x80\x9D positings can be made, the pre-egological stream, though \xE2\x80\x9Cinfinite,\xE2\x80\x9D is neither actual nor potential (128). As Deleuze might say, it is merely \xE2\x80\x9Cvirtual\xE2\x80\x9D and thus no topic for phenomenological reflection. This helps explain Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s dogged insistence, even in his latest writings, on preserving a central role for the individual transcendental ego \xE2\x80\x93 an insistence that is too often treated merely as vestigial \xE2\x80\x9CCartesian-ism.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The dramatic high-point of Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s book is reached in Chapter Three as well, in a quite unlikely place. For in a little-studied set of paragraphs in which Husserl analyzes the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cneutrality modification\xE2\x80\x9D, Brainard locates a dire \xE2\x80\x9Cthreat\xE2\x80\x9D to the completion of Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s system (its ascent to absolute reason or God) and so to the fate of humanity as such. Husserl is said to introduce the odd topic of a universal neutrality modification for the systematic reason that it defines the root of the crisis which has motivated the system all along (289). Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s argument for this view is complex, but it can perhaps be sketched briefly. By this point in the text Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s analyses have shown that belief is the \xE2\x80\x9Cground of productive conscious life\xE2\x80\x9D (30) \xE2\x80\x93 that is, that life\xE2\x80\x99s striving toward reason by way of norm-governed scrutiny of its intentionally constituted world depends on \xE2\x80\x9Cbelief and the interest it entails\xE2\x80\x9D (180). Parallel to these basic \xE2\x80\x9Cdoxic\xE2\x80\x9D forms of consciousness, however, there is a \xE2\x80\x9Cmodification\xE2\x80\x9D in which, keeping the content the same, the belief-character of the act is \xE2\x80\x9Cneutralized\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 one example being the epoch\xC3\xA9 itself, fantasy another. In such modes consciousness is \xE2\x80\x9Cidle\xE2\x80\x9D (167), \xE2\x80\x9Cinauthentic\xE2\x80\x9D (179), indifferent; positing nothing, it cannot be evaluated by reason (180). When Husserl points out the possibility of a <i>universal</i> neutrality modification affecting every positing act, then, this must, according to Brainard, have systematic significance \xE2\x80\x93 namely, as a <i>diagnosis</i> of the crisis of reason itself (32). At bottom, then, the crisis is not a belief in unreason, or even unbelief, but rather the possibility, inherent in life itself, that it will abandon productive striving altogether in favor of a universally neutral attitude toward all belief, an existence entirely in the dimension of the \xE2\x80\x9Cas-if,\xE2\x80\x9D with no more commitment than one has toward the most idly entertained thought (161). Fortunately, it turns out that \xE2\x80\x9Ceven if the neutrality modification is able to stop the ego in its tracks . . . the stream \xE2\x80\x93 and thus time \xE2\x80\x93 continues to flow, which means that the ego continues to believe, if darkly\xE2\x80\x9D (170). Thus there is a way out of the crisis and Husserl can continue his ascent to reason. In a brief concluding chapter, Brainard nicely shows how reason is initially an adjectival modification of consciousness itself, a function of its evidential structure.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I confess that I am not convinced by Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s argument for the importance of the neutrality modification for understanding the crisis that motivated Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s thinking. First, if it were as central as Brainard says it is, it seems odd that Husserl never even alludes to the neutrality modification in any of his accounts of the crisis. More importantly, what Husserl calls the \xE2\x80\x9Ccrisis of reason\xE2\x80\x9D does not seem well-described by talk of an idle consciousness holding itself in a state of indifference with regard to its own life (which is not to say that there is no such state!). Rather, he seems to have in view an increase in the <i>denial</i> of reason and the embrace of unreason \xE2\x80\x93 for instance, in the rejection of \xE2\x80\x9Cideal norms.\xE2\x80\x9D This belongs in the arena of <i>doxa</i> and not neutrality. No matter how one decides this issue, however, the virtues of this bold, impressively researched, and unfailingly intelligent reflection on <i>Ideas I</i> will be plain to every serious reader.</p>"

The need for it arises not from some dispute internal to the philosophical tradition \xE2\x80\x93 in fact it \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes not and, for principal reasons cannot, stand in any tradition\xE2\x80\x9D (14) \xE2\x80\x93 but from what Husserl calls the \xE2\x80\x9Ccrisis of reason,\xE2\x80\x9D the \xE2\x80\x9Clife and death struggle between belief and unbelief, between universal philosophy and scepticism\xE2\x80\x9D whose symptoms are found in naturalism, positivism, and objectivism. Only on a phenomenolog-ical basis can \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversal philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D eventually be achieved (7); Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s thought therefore has a system as its <i>goal</i>, not as its beginning. It is not a \xE2\x80\x9Cdeductive\xE2\x80\x9D system, not \xE2\x80\x9Csomething finished,\xE2\x80\x9D but an \xE2\x80\x9Cintuitive\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cfounded system\xE2\x80\x9D that operates between a \xE2\x80\x9Clowermost limit\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 the \xE2\x80\x9Cpure ego\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 and an \xE2\x80\x9Cuppermost limit\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute reason or God\xE2\x80\x9D (25). The task of thinking is to make a genuine beginning upon which, \xE2\x80\x9Cstone by stone,\xE2\x80\x9D it can build, over generations, toward the knowledge of that which is \xE2\x80\x9Chighest\xE2\x80\x9D and therefore \xE2\x80\x9Cthe ground, the root of everything\xE2\x80\x9D (23-24). In this, phenomenology mirrors the essence of the <i>animale rationale</i>, whose life is striving toward the <i>telos</i> of increasing rationalization (15). Because \xE2\x80\x9Call life is position-taking\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 that is, <i>belief</i> \xE2\x80\x93 and therefore \xE2\x80\x9Csubject to an ought [<i>Sollen</i>]\xE2\x80\x9D (15), the poles of the system are built into the very essence of life; a crisis of belief thus becomes a life-and-death matter.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The belief at issue here is not <i>pistis</i>, faith, but <i>doxa</i>, something far more basic that characterizes our overall stance in the world, the \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural attitude.\xE2\x80\x9D If a scientific path toward knowledge of God is to be found, it must pass through a mode of belief that cannot be shaken. Though belief in the world might appear to satisfy this condition, Husserl is convinced that it does not, and Brainard devotes Chapter Two to the hotly contested sections of <i>Ideas I</i> in which Husserl attempts to motivate this claim and delimit a kind of belief that in fact satisfies the condition. This requires clarification of two mainstays of phenomenolog-ical method \xE2\x80\x93 the eidetic reduction and the epoch\xC3\xA9 \xE2\x80\x93 and since Brainard argues that Husserl never wavered in the principles of his method (58), his interpretation amounts to the unfashionable claim that Husserl remained strongly \xE2\x80\x9Cessential-ist\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cfoundationalist.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Concerning the eidetic reduction Brainard cogently lays out Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s argument that all factual, empirical sciences presuppose \xE2\x80\x9Csciences of essence\xE2\x80\x9D since empirical claims depend on conceptual necessities that cannot be derived from experience. Without the possibility of such knowledge, according to Husserl, science must ultimately fall victim to scepticism; but a merely logical, or argumentative, treatment of this problem oscillates endlessly between sceptical denial and dogmatic circularity. Thus Husserl invokes his \xE2\x80\x9Cprinciple of all principles\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 namely, the absolute right, as a source of justification, of what presents itself in intuitive <i>Evidenz</i>. By that standard, essences (necessities) are just as intuitable as are empirical things, and phenomenology \xE2\x80\x93 which is to be a \xE2\x80\x9Cfirst\xE2\x80\x9D science and therefore an eidetic one \xE2\x80\x93 will proceed by intuition. However, to say that phenomenology is an eidetic science is not yet to specify its distinctive field of investigation. For this a \xE2\x80\x9Csecond reduction\xE2\x80\x9D is needed, one that \xE2\x80\x9Cprovides eidetic inquiry with its absolute ground, its direction, its sense\xE2\x80\x9D (36). This role is played by the epoch\xC3\xA9.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s careful elucidation of the epoch\xC3\xA9 and its motivation centers on the status of belief. In an elaborate series of reflections Husserl tries to show that our ordinary \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural attitude\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x9Cthe posit of or belief in the existence of the world\xE2\x80\x9D (60), a belief that is \xE2\x80\x9Cunique and decisive\xE2\x80\x9D (61) because it enters into each belief directed toward things <i>in</i> the world \xE2\x80\x93 can and must be superseded in favor of a \xE2\x80\x9Cphenomenological attitude\xE2\x80\x9D that reveals an epistemically prior and absolutely grounding \xE2\x80\x9Cpure consciousness.\xE2\x80\x9D Starting with the character of belief as such, Husserl unpacks Descartes\xE2\x80\x99 notion of universal doubt to show that a certain \xE2\x80\x9Cmodification\xE2\x80\x9D of believing consciousness is always possible \xE2\x80\x93 not one in which I <i>doubt</i> what I previously believed, but one in which I put that belief \xE2\x80\x9Cout of play,\xE2\x80\x9D make no epistemic use of it, though it remains my belief so long as I have no reason to transform it into doubt. The epoch\xC3\xA9 is such a \xE2\x80\x9Cneutralization of belief.\xE2\x80\x9D But while <i>any</i> belief or set of beliefs can be neutralized, Brainard notes that a truly universal epoch\xC3\xA9 would not serve Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s purpose, since it would leave no \xE2\x80\x9Cunmodified\xE2\x80\x9D region of belief upon which to establish a science of phenomenology (67-8). Why, then, does Husserl choose specifically to apply it to the \xE2\x80\x9Cgeneral thesis\xE2\x80\x9D of world-belief? Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s text \xE2\x80\x93 and so Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s commentary \xE2\x80\x93 is none too clear on this matter, but it is because Husserl understands world-belief in terms of a contrast between \xE2\x80\x9Ctranscendent\xE2\x80\x9D perception (in which consciousness grasps what is other than it) and \xE2\x80\x9Cimmanent\xE2\x80\x9D perception (in which consciousness grasps itself) and holds that neutralizing all transcendent (or worldly) belief will leave a sphere of immanent perception, or \xE2\x80\x9Cpure consciousness,\xE2\x80\x9D as a \xE2\x80\x9Cphenomenological residuum.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Even if we grant such a distinction, however, why should pure consciousness be of particular interest to one seeking an absolute foundation for philosophy? Here Brainard leads us through the maze of paragraphs in which Husserl argues that what is perceived immanently not merely survives the epoch\xC3\xA9 of world-belief, but is a region of \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute being,\xE2\x80\x9D whereas the world has a merely \xE2\x80\x9Crelative being\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 indeed, is \xE2\x80\x9Cnothing at all\xE2\x80\x9D beyond \xE2\x80\x9Csomething presented or something apparent in the manner peculiar to consciousness\xE2\x80\x9D (98). The key here, as Brainard points out, is Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s <i>epistemic</i> claim that no transcendent perception excludes the possible non-existence of its object, whereas the existence of the object of immanent perception \xE2\x80\x9Ccannot be doubted without leading to a countersense\xE2\x80\x9D (90). For Husserl, this epistemic difference seems to authorize an essential <i>ontological</i> distinction between consciousness and world, and further, an essential dependence of the latter on the former. </p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The nature of this dependence is the crux of all debates over the character of Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cidealism,\xE2\x80\x9D and though Brainard practices \xE2\x80\x9Creticence\xE2\x80\x9D with respect to such debates, his reconstruction has implications for them. For instance, he (279) explicitly rejects the view \xE2\x80\x93 advocated by J. N. Mohanty and others \xE2\x80\x93 that pure consciousness is not a region of \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute being\xE2\x80\x9D but the ontologically neutral terrain of <i>Sinn</i> \xE2\x80\x93 a \xE2\x80\x9Cregion of sense\xE2\x80\x9D as Brainard himself calls it (101) \xE2\x80\x93 in which all modes of \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing\xE2\x80\x9D are constituted. Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation depends, however, on the claim that the neutralization of belief carried out in the epoch\xC3\xA9 is an \xE2\x80\x9Cannihiliation\xE2\x80\x9D (69) of the world in the same ontological sense in which Husserl speaks of a conceivable \xE2\x80\x9Cannihilation of the world of physical things\xE2\x80\x9D in which the \xE2\x80\x9Cexistence [of consciousness] would not be touched\xE2\x80\x9D (Husserl, cited by Brainard, 97). Yet these are arguably two very different things. Nor is the fact that Husserl uses the term \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute being\xE2\x80\x9D decisive here, since earlier drafts (and the published text itself) make it clear that the term is equivalent to \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute <i>givenness</i>.\xE2\x80\x9D One reason for Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s insistence on a strong ontological reading does, however, emerge in Chapter Three, where he presents Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s attempt, following the application of the epoch\xC3\xA9, to lay out the main elements of the \xE2\x80\x9Clowermost limit of the system,\xE2\x80\x9D the field of pure consciousness.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Though occasionally this chapter lapses from clarifying commentary to something closer to paraphrase, in general it provides valuable guidance for approaching difficult topics such as intentional-ity, noesis/noema, modalization, synthesis (constitution), and expression. Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s numerous and minute distinctions are expertly analyzed, and though the logotecto-nic method means that where Husserl is ambiguous so Brainard will be (for instance, on the question of whether the noema is some sort of representation or abstract entity), there are exciting and surprising insights throughout. One of these is Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s argument \xE2\x80\x93 again, an unfashionable one \xE2\x80\x93 that the \xE2\x80\x9Cpure ego\xE2\x80\x9D remains the \xE2\x80\x9CArchimedian point\xE2\x80\x9D (3) of phenomenology. Recent work in Husserl-studies has tended to downplay the importance of the egological level of constitution in favor of the supposedly more \xE2\x80\x9Cprimordial\xE2\x80\x9D pre-egological level of passivity, affectivity, embodiment, and the temporal streaming of experience itself. Brainard, in contrast, argues that in the absence of an ego in terms of which a distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cactional\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cpotential\xE2\x80\x9D positings can be made, the pre-egological stream, though \xE2\x80\x9Cinfinite,\xE2\x80\x9D is neither actual nor potential (128). As Deleuze might say, it is merely \xE2\x80\x9Cvirtual\xE2\x80\x9D and thus no topic for phenomenological reflection. This helps explain Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s dogged insistence, even in his latest writings, on preserving a central role for the individual transcendental ego \xE2\x80\x93 an insistence that is too often treated merely as vestigial \xE2\x80\x9CCartesian-ism.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The dramatic high-point of Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s book is reached in Chapter Three as well, in a quite unlikely place. For in a little-studied set of paragraphs in which Husserl analyzes the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cneutrality modification\xE2\x80\x9D, Brainard locates a dire \xE2\x80\x9Cthreat\xE2\x80\x9D to the completion of Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s system (its ascent to absolute reason or God) and so to the fate of humanity as such. Husserl is said to introduce the odd topic of a universal neutrality modification for the systematic reason that it defines the root of the crisis which has motivated the system all along (289). Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s argument for this view is complex, but it can perhaps be sketched briefly. By this point in the text Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s analyses have shown that belief is the \xE2\x80\x9Cground of productive conscious life\xE2\x80\x9D (30) \xE2\x80\x93 that is, that life\xE2\x80\x99s striving toward reason by way of norm-governed scrutiny of its intentionally constituted world depends on \xE2\x80\x9Cbelief and the interest it entails\xE2\x80\x9D (180). Parallel to these basic \xE2\x80\x9Cdoxic\xE2\x80\x9D forms of consciousness, however, there is a \xE2\x80\x9Cmodification\xE2\x80\x9D in which, keeping the content the same, the belief-character of the act is \xE2\x80\x9Cneutralized\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 one example being the epoch\xC3\xA9 itself, fantasy another. In such modes consciousness is \xE2\x80\x9Cidle\xE2\x80\x9D (167), \xE2\x80\x9Cinauthentic\xE2\x80\x9D (179), indifferent; positing nothing, it cannot be evaluated by reason (180). When Husserl points out the possibility of a <i>universal</i> neutrality modification affecting every positing act, then, this must, according to Brainard, have systematic significance \xE2\x80\x93 namely, as a <i>diagnosis</i> of the crisis of reason itself (32). At bottom, then, the crisis is not a belief in unreason, or even unbelief, but rather the possibility, inherent in life itself, that it will abandon productive striving altogether in favor of a universally neutral attitude toward all belief, an existence entirely in the dimension of the \xE2\x80\x9Cas-if,\xE2\x80\x9D with no more commitment than one has toward the most idly entertained thought (161). Fortunately, it turns out that \xE2\x80\x9Ceven if the neutrality modification is able to stop the ego in its tracks . . . the stream \xE2\x80\x93 and thus time \xE2\x80\x93 continues to flow, which means that the ego continues to believe, if darkly\xE2\x80\x9D (170). Thus there is a way out of the crisis and Husserl can continue his ascent to reason. In a brief concluding chapter, Brainard nicely shows how reason is initially an adjectival modification of consciousness itself, a function of its evidential structure.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I confess that I am not convinced by Brainard\xE2\x80\x99s argument for the importance of the neutrality modification for understanding the crisis that motivated Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s thinking. First, if it were as central as Brainard says it is, it seems odd that Husserl never even alludes to the neutrality modification in any of his accounts of the crisis. More importantly, what Husserl calls the \xE2\x80\x9Ccrisis of reason\xE2\x80\x9D does not seem well-described by talk of an idle consciousness holding itself in a state of indifference with regard to its own life (which is not to say that there is no such state!). Rather, he seems to have in view an increase in the <i>denial</i> of reason and the embrace of unreason \xE2\x80\x93 for instance, in the rejection of \xE2\x80\x9Cideal norms.\xE2\x80\x9D This belongs in the arena of <i>doxa</i> and not neutrality. No matter how one decides this issue, however, the virtues of this bold, impressively researched, and unfailingly intelligent reflection on <i>Ideas I</i> will be plain to every serious reader.</p>"
