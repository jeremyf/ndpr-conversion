content: "<p>This is a time to take stock, especially for intellectuals on the (traditional) Left. The end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union have brought to the fore two major conflicting tendencies: on the one hand, the upsurge of religious faith in many parts of the world, sometimes in the guise of a dogmatic fundamentalism; on the other hand, the triumphant rise of liberalism\xE2\x80\x94now in the form of capitalist neo-liberalism\xE2\x80\x94as a corollary of globalization. These developments have a peculiar bearing on the Frankfurt School, which by now spans at least two generations. While many members of the first generation were sympathetic to religion (though not to any kind of dogmatism) in the form of a subdued Jewish messianism, the basic initial impulse of the School\xE2\x80\x94as an \xE2\x80\x9CInstitute of Social Research\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94was the critical analysis of late capitalism and bourgeois-liberal society. These tendencies were nearly reversed during the second generation. Under the guidance of J\xC3\xBCrgen Habermas, \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical theory\xE2\x80\x9D showed little or no interest in religious faith, preferring instead to champion a purely rational discourse (inspired in part by neo-Kantianism and linguistic philosophy). At the same time, again under Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s influence, critical theory has steadily moved closer to political liberalism, to the point that the distinction from Rawlsian proceduralism sometimes appears as a mere nuance. Small wonder that many observers have detected a gulf separating the two generations. Eduardo Mendieta, the editor of this collection, seeks to counteract and correct this perception. In his view (p.2, p.12), the second generation of the Frankfurt School has \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout equivocation\xE2\x80\x9D continued the agenda of the first. With regard to religion, a central thesis of his introduction is that Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s work \xE2\x80\x9Cis not correctly characterized by the image of a temporal rupture between an early positive and a later negative appraisal of the role of religion.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The essays collected in <i>Religion and Rationality</i> are meant to \xE2\x80\x9Cconstitute evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (p.14) of Mendieta\xE2\x80\x99s claim of undisrupted continuity. As it happens, several of the selected essays date from the earlier period of Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s career\xE2\x80\x94prior to his full \xE2\x80\x9Clinguistic turn\xE2\x80\x9D to discourse theory\xE2\x80\x94when he was still relatively close to first generation thinkers; and while chapters taken from a later period\xE2\x80\x94including a recent interview with Mendieta\xE2\x80\x94mitigate the harsher connotations of \xE2\x80\x9Ctemporal rupture\xE2\x80\x9D, they can hardly be said to provide evidence of a smooth continuity. The impression of discontinuity is confirmed even by Mendieta\xE2\x80\x99s own (otherwise informative) \xE2\x80\x9CIntroduction\xE2\x80\x9D to the volume. Here one finds first of all a sensitive discussion of the religious leanings of the first generation, especially of its \xE2\x80\x9CJewish utopian messianism\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94in which Mendieta detects four main ingredients (p.4): restorative-anamnetic, utopian, apocalyptic, and messianic. Aspects of this outlook are illustrated in the writings of Bloch, Benjamin, Horkheimer, and Adorno. In the case of Horkheimer, reference is made (p.5, p.7) to his appeal to \xE2\x80\x9Can entirely Other (<i>ein ganz Anderes</i>),\xE2\x80\x9D his yearning for something \xE2\x80\x9Cwholly other\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolutely unrepresentable\xE2\x80\x9D through which the injustices of history could be redeemed. Similar motifs are found in the writings of Adorno (p.8-9), especially in his treatment of the otherness of the Other as \xE2\x80\x9Cirreplaceable and unrepresentable singularity,\xE2\x80\x9D and his refusal to accept \xE2\x80\x9Cthe assimilation of the singular into the concept\xE2\x80\x9D (without dismissing concepts as such). Mendieta also quotes Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s statement: \xE2\x80\x9CIf religion is accepted for the sake of something other than its own truth content, then it undermines itself,\xE2\x80\x9D and his addendum (in <i>Negative Dialectics</i>) that attempts to capture the Other immanently always put otherness \xE2\x80\x9Cin jeopardy.\xE2\x80\x9D What was common to most first-generation thinkers was the assumption (p.11) that religion remains a reservoir \xE2\x80\x9Cof humanity\xE2\x80\x99s most deeply felt injustices and yearned for dreams of reconciliation.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Seen against this background, the following discussion devoted to Habermas gives the impression of a sea-change\xE2\x80\x94despite Mendieta\xE2\x80\x99s assurance (p.11) that the notion of an anti-religious bias is \xE2\x80\x9Cmisleading.\xE2\x80\x9D Rather than explicating this assurance, the Introduction turns to Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s pronounced social-scientific endeavors, especially his embrace of a mode of \xE2\x80\x9Cfunctionalism\xE2\x80\x9D (inspired by Parsons and Luhmann) and his elaboration of evolutionary models of social and individual development. In large part, as Mendieta observes (p.14), these endeavors were prompted by \xE2\x80\x9Cdissatisfaction\xE2\x80\x9D with the first generation\xE2\x80\x99s treatment of rationality, and especially its refusal to take seriously Weber\xE2\x80\x99s thesis of progressive societal \xE2\x80\x9Crationalization,\xE2\x80\x9D secularization and disenchantment. Borrowing from Weber and functionalists, Habermas at this point developed a comprehensive theory of social life, comprising \xE2\x80\x9Csystem\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Clifeworld\xE2\x80\x9D dimensions and moving through the stages of archaic, primitive, traditional, and modern societies. From a social-scientific vantage, religion fulfills basically an immanent societal \xE2\x80\x9Cfunction\xE2\x80\x9D whose meaning changes over time. Habermas comes close to this view in his statement (p.18) that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe idea of God is transformed [<i>aufgehoben</i>] into the concept of a <i>Logos</i> that determines the community of believers and the real life-context of a self-emancipating society\xE2\x80\x9D and in the notion that \xE2\x80\x9CGod is the name for the substance that gives coherence, unity, and thickness to the life-world.\xE2\x80\x9D Mendieta also elaborates on Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Clinguistic turn,\xE2\x80\x9D especially his formulation of a \xE2\x80\x9Cdiscourse morality\xE2\x80\x9D and a \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversal pragmatics\xE2\x80\x9D of speech acts (totalizing all modes of linguistic interaction). Crucial in this context is the thesis of the progressive \xE2\x80\x9Clinguistification of the sacred,\xE2\x80\x9D the latter seen as the \xE2\x80\x9Ccatalyst of modernity.\xE2\x80\x9D Religion at this point remains relevant (only) to the extent that it can be translated or assimilated into discursive language. Illustrative here are Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s assertion (in <i>The Theory of Communicative Action</i>) that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe aura of rapture and terror that emanates from the sacred, the spellbinding power of the holy, is sublimated into the binding/bonding force of criticizable validity claims,\xE2\x80\x9D and his parallel statement that \xE2\x80\x9Conly a morality, set communicatively aflow and developed into a discourse ethics, can replace the authority of the sacred\xE2\x80\x9D (p.24).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>At the end of this overview, Mendieta reaffirms his conviction of continuity, stating (p.24) that, while \xE2\x80\x9Ccertainly a secularist,\xE2\x80\x9D Habermas is by no means an \xE2\x80\x9Canti-religion <i>philosophe</i>.\xE2\x80\x9D The point here, however, is not being for or against religion, but whether there are sufficient antennae to respect the difference, and respective integrity, of reason and faith, discursive validity and redemptive hope. In a functionalist (or quasi-functionalist) systems theory assigning a place or role to everything under the sun, where can there still be room for the \xE2\x80\x9Cwholly other\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolutely unrepresentable\xE2\x80\x9D invoked by Horkheimer? Likewise, in a theory of universal pragmatics comprehending all possible speech acts, where can there still be room for any language beside that of discursive validity claims? Moreover, in a conception of linguistic intersubjectivity construed (with Mead) as \xE2\x80\x9Cego-alter-ego\xE2\x80\x9D relation, is there still a loophole left for the Other as \xE2\x80\x9Cirreplaceable and unrepresentable singularity\xE2\x80\x9D in Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s sense? As Mendieta points out (p.12), Habermas repeatedly acknowledges the debt owed by Enlightenment and modernity to the Judeo-Christian legacy. But this can be read as a simple developmental scheme. Here the \xE2\x80\x9Clinguistification\xE2\x80\x9D thesis needs to be pondered. Does the thesis mean that, before discourse theory, religion or the sacred lacked language and was \xE2\x80\x9Cspeechless\xE2\x80\x9D (p.28)? But then how were its teachings transmitted? Or does the thesis mean that, in modernity, religion will be sublimated or absorbed without a remainder into discursive rationality? In this connection, how is one to read Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s statement (in <i>Postmetaphysical Thinking</i>): \xE2\x80\x9CAs long as no better words for what religion can say are found in the medium of rational discourse, it [communicative reason] will even coexist abstemiously with the former\xE2\x80\x9D? Does this leave to religion only the options of absorption (in rationality) or exclusion? Does faith always have to \xE2\x80\x9Caccommodate itself\xE2\x80\x9D (p.150) and bend to modern reason, and never the other way around? But how does this respect their differential integrity? More specifically, given the fact that \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversal\xE2\x80\x9D pragmatics is necessarily timeless, holding good at all times and places, how can it allow for the distinct temporality of salvation history and the redemptive hope for a messianic future animating the early Frankfurt School?</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Limitations of space do not permit a detailed review of all the essays assembled in the volume. For present purposes, I restrict myself to a few brief comments. Readers interested in Jewish thought may find most appealing the first and the last of the selected essays, where Habermas displays his more sensitive-empathetic qualities. The first is titled \xE2\x80\x9CThe German Idealism of the Jewish Philosophers\xE2\x80\x9D and ranges broadly (and insightfully) from Buber and Rosenzweig via Cohen and the Marburg School to Cassirer, Bloch, and Benjamin. The last deals with Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s friend Gershom Scholem and his search for \xE2\x80\x9Cthe other of history in history\xE2\x80\x9D (a search focused on Isaak Luria, Sabbatai Sevi, and the kabbalistic tradition). As distinguished from this amicable treatment, the other chapters tend to accentuate more the tensional/conflictual nexus between reason and faith or Athens and Jerusalem. Thus, an essay \xE2\x80\x9COn the Difficulty of Saying No\xE2\x80\x9D illustrates, in Mendieta\xE2\x80\x99s words (p.25), the \xE2\x80\x9Crelationship between rationalization and mythological or religious world-views, in which the latter must submit to the transformative criticism enacted by the former.\xE2\x80\x9D Another chapter, \xE2\x80\x9CTranscendence from Within, Transcendence in this World\xE2\x80\x9D, goes back to a conference held in Chicago on \xE2\x80\x9CHabermas and Public Theology\xE2\x80\x9D (in 1988). There, responding to theologians and non-theologians, and defending \xE2\x80\x9Cmethodical atheism\xE2\x80\x9D as the only acceptable option for \xE2\x80\x9Cpostmetaphysical\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy, Habermas asserts among other things (p.76) that \xE2\x80\x9Cwhoever puts forth a truth claim today must, nevertheless, translate experiences that have their home in religious discourse into the language of a scientific expert culture\xE2\x80\x9D (or at least into the language of discourse theory). He also questions (p.81) whether the \xE2\x80\x9C<i>superadditum</i>\xE2\x80\x9D of religion is required if we \xE2\x80\x9Cendeavor to act according to moral commands.\xE2\x80\x9D Another essay, \xE2\x80\x9CIsrael or Athens\xE2\x80\x9D, deals with the Judeo-Christian theology of Johannes Baptist Metz, and especially with the latter\xE2\x80\x99s notions of \xE2\x80\x9Canamnesis\xE2\x80\x9D and a \xE2\x80\x9Cpolycentric world church.\xE2\x80\x9D There, while appreciating some of Metz\xE2\x80\x99s leanings, Habermas comes to the defense of Athens, arguing (p.133, p.136) that \xE2\x80\x9Cprofane reason must remain skeptical about the mystical causality of a recollection inspired by the history of salvation\xE2\x80\x9D and that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe idea of a polycentric church depends in turn on insights of the European Enlightenment and its political philosophy.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Perhaps the distance separating Habermas from the first generation of Frankfurt thinkers is most clearly illustrated in an essay devoted to the work of Michael Theunissen, \xE2\x80\x9CCommunicative Freedom and Negative Theology.\xE2\x80\x9D As it happens, Theunissen\xE2\x80\x99s writings\xE2\x80\x94under Christian auspices and with a focus on Hegel transformed by Kierkegaard\xE2\x80\x94recapture in many ways the Jewish religious aspirations of that first generation. As Habermas acknowledges (p.113), Theunissen maintains trust in \xE2\x80\x9Can eschatological turning of the world\xE2\x80\x9D and tries to show philosophically \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy profane hope must be anchored in eschatological hope.\xE2\x80\x9D To buttress this view, Theunissen transforms Hegelian subjectivity into a Kierkegaardian \xE2\x80\x9Cunrepresentable singularity,\xE2\x80\x9D and Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s lateral conception of intersubjectivity into a much more open-ended, vertical relation to radical otherness. In Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s words (p.116), \xE2\x80\x9Che is convinced that every interpersonal relation is embedded in a relation to the radically Other, which precedes the relation to the concrete Other\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cembodies an absolute freedom\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94a conception that \xE2\x80\x9Ccan be traced back to elements of Jewish and Protestant mysticism.\xE2\x80\x9D In this perspective, God as the \xE2\x80\x9Cradically Other\xE2\x80\x9D is present in human history \xE2\x80\x9Cin the form of a promise, the \xE2\x80\x98anticipatory\xE2\x80\x99 present of a fulfilled future\xE2\x80\x9D which alone can redeem human suffering and despair. Countering this outlook, Habermas brings to bear a battery of considerations: first of all the \xE2\x80\x9Canthropological fact\xE2\x80\x9D (p.122) of human self-maintenance (despite despair); and secondly the Kantian notion of . <i>priori</i> conditions of possibility (saying that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe mode of successfully being a self can only be employed in a <i>hypothetical</i> way in the transcendental clarification of its conditions of possibility\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94on which basis \xE2\x80\x9Cfaith could only be justified in functional terms\xE2\x80\x9D). Finally, the essay chides Theunissen for ignoring the basic tenets of formal or universal pragmatics, which \xE2\x80\x9Call subjects must accept insofar as they orient their action towards validity claims at all\xE2\x80\x9D and which alone \xE2\x80\x9Ccan provide the normative basis for a critical theory of society\xE2\x80\x9D (p.118). Regarding Theunissen\xE2\x80\x99s trust in \xE2\x80\x9Ca transcendence irrupting into history\xE2\x80\x9D and his attempt to provide arguments supporting this trust, Habermas concludes (p.123): \xE2\x80\x9CI am unable to accept these reasons.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>My task here is not to arbitrate between Athens and Jerusalem or to judge the respective merits of rational-philosophical and religious-theological arguments. My point here was simply to cast doubt on Mendieta\xE2\x80\x99s claim of a smooth, uninterrupted continuity between the two generations of the Frankfurt School. This doubt is further reinforced by developments in another arena for which Habermas has shown little sympathy: French philosophy, especially in its deconstructive variant. As it seems to me, many of the motifs of the first generation\xE2\x80\x94appeals to eschatology and a \xE2\x80\x9Cradically Other\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94have resurfaced in recent decades in the writings of French Jewish and Christian thinkers, from Levinas to Derrida and Marion. Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s essays make no reference to Levinas, and his comments on Derrida are almost uniformly dismissive. Have motifs of the first generation thus emigrated from Frankfurt into new terrains? Whatever the answer here may be, the concern is that other issues may likewise have traveled elsewhere. I mentioned at the beginning the progressive accommodation of \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical theory\xE2\x80\x9D to American liberalism\xE2\x80\x94a trend acquiring ominous portents under the auspices of a globalized neo-liberalism. To Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s credit, there are passages in Mendieta\xE2\x80\x99s book showing awareness of these portents, as when, in the essay on Metz (p.30), he castigates \xE2\x80\x9Cthe barbaric reverse side of its own mirror\xE2\x80\x9D which Western Enlightenment has ignored for too long and which has encouraged the rise of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe stifling power of a capitalistic world civilization, which assimilates alien cultures and abandons its own traditions to oblivion.\xE2\x80\x9D However, in the later interview with Mendieta, we learn (p.153) that the current state of the world is really \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout any clearly recogniziable alternative\xE2\x80\x9D and that \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is no reasonable exit-option left to us from a capitalist world society today.\xE2\x80\x9D Although deploring the \xE2\x80\x9Cunjust distribution of good fortune in the world,\xE2\x80\x9D redress for this situation belongs for Habermas to politics and economics, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot in the cupboard of morality, let alone moral theory\xE2\x80\x9D (p.166). As he reiterates, the \xE2\x80\x9Cburning issue of a just global order\xE2\x80\x9D is basically a \xE2\x80\x9Cpolitical\xE2\x80\x9D (that is, a tactical or strategic) problem, and \xE2\x80\x9Cnot a question for moral theory\xE2\x80\x9D or discourse ethics. Does this mean that the poor and marginalized populations of the Third and Fourth World can no loner expect intellectual and ethical support for their plight from Frankfurt? In this case, the rupture between the two generations would indeed seem unbridgeable.</p>"

Illustrative here are Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s assertion (in <i>The Theory of Communicative Action</i>) that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe aura of rapture and terror that emanates from the sacred, the spellbinding power of the holy, is sublimated into the binding/bonding force of criticizable validity claims,\xE2\x80\x9D and his parallel statement that \xE2\x80\x9Conly a morality, set communicatively aflow and developed into a discourse ethics, can replace the authority of the sacred\xE2\x80\x9D (p.24).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>At the end of this overview, Mendieta reaffirms his conviction of continuity, stating (p.24) that, while \xE2\x80\x9Ccertainly a secularist,\xE2\x80\x9D Habermas is by no means an \xE2\x80\x9Canti-religion <i>philosophe</i>.\xE2\x80\x9D The point here, however, is not being for or against religion, but whether there are sufficient antennae to respect the difference, and respective integrity, of reason and faith, discursive validity and redemptive hope. In a functionalist (or quasi-functionalist) systems theory assigning a place or role to everything under the sun, where can there still be room for the \xE2\x80\x9Cwholly other\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolutely unrepresentable\xE2\x80\x9D invoked by Horkheimer? Likewise, in a theory of universal pragmatics comprehending all possible speech acts, where can there still be room for any language beside that of discursive validity claims? Moreover, in a conception of linguistic intersubjectivity construed (with Mead) as \xE2\x80\x9Cego-alter-ego\xE2\x80\x9D relation, is there still a loophole left for the Other as \xE2\x80\x9Cirreplaceable and unrepresentable singularity\xE2\x80\x9D in Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s sense? As Mendieta points out (p.12), Habermas repeatedly acknowledges the debt owed by Enlightenment and modernity to the Judeo-Christian legacy. But this can be read as a simple developmental scheme. Here the \xE2\x80\x9Clinguistification\xE2\x80\x9D thesis needs to be pondered. Does the thesis mean that, before discourse theory, religion or the sacred lacked language and was \xE2\x80\x9Cspeechless\xE2\x80\x9D (p.28)? But then how were its teachings transmitted? Or does the thesis mean that, in modernity, religion will be sublimated or absorbed without a remainder into discursive rationality? In this connection, how is one to read Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s statement (in <i>Postmetaphysical Thinking</i>): \xE2\x80\x9CAs long as no better words for what religion can say are found in the medium of rational discourse, it [communicative reason] will even coexist abstemiously with the former\xE2\x80\x9D? Does this leave to religion only the options of absorption (in rationality) or exclusion? Does faith always have to \xE2\x80\x9Caccommodate itself\xE2\x80\x9D (p.150) and bend to modern reason, and never the other way around? But how does this respect their differential integrity? More specifically, given the fact that \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversal\xE2\x80\x9D pragmatics is necessarily timeless, holding good at all times and places, how can it allow for the distinct temporality of salvation history and the redemptive hope for a messianic future animating the early Frankfurt School?</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Limitations of space do not permit a detailed review of all the essays assembled in the volume. For present purposes, I restrict myself to a few brief comments. Readers interested in Jewish thought may find most appealing the first and the last of the selected essays, where Habermas displays his more sensitive-empathetic qualities. The first is titled \xE2\x80\x9CThe German Idealism of the Jewish Philosophers\xE2\x80\x9D and ranges broadly (and insightfully) from Buber and Rosenzweig via Cohen and the Marburg School to Cassirer, Bloch, and Benjamin. The last deals with Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s friend Gershom Scholem and his search for \xE2\x80\x9Cthe other of history in history\xE2\x80\x9D (a search focused on Isaak Luria, Sabbatai Sevi, and the kabbalistic tradition). As distinguished from this amicable treatment, the other chapters tend to accentuate more the tensional/conflictual nexus between reason and faith or Athens and Jerusalem. Thus, an essay \xE2\x80\x9COn the Difficulty of Saying No\xE2\x80\x9D illustrates, in Mendieta\xE2\x80\x99s words (p.25), the \xE2\x80\x9Crelationship between rationalization and mythological or religious world-views, in which the latter must submit to the transformative criticism enacted by the former.\xE2\x80\x9D Another chapter, \xE2\x80\x9CTranscendence from Within, Transcendence in this World\xE2\x80\x9D, goes back to a conference held in Chicago on \xE2\x80\x9CHabermas and Public Theology\xE2\x80\x9D (in 1988). There, responding to theologians and non-theologians, and defending \xE2\x80\x9Cmethodical atheism\xE2\x80\x9D as the only acceptable option for \xE2\x80\x9Cpostmetaphysical\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy, Habermas asserts among other things (p.76) that \xE2\x80\x9Cwhoever puts forth a truth claim today must, nevertheless, translate experiences that have their home in religious discourse into the language of a scientific expert culture\xE2\x80\x9D (or at least into the language of discourse theory). He also questions (p.81) whether the \xE2\x80\x9C<i>superadditum</i>\xE2\x80\x9D of religion is required if we \xE2\x80\x9Cendeavor to act according to moral commands.\xE2\x80\x9D Another essay, \xE2\x80\x9CIsrael or Athens\xE2\x80\x9D, deals with the Judeo-Christian theology of Johannes Baptist Metz, and especially with the latter\xE2\x80\x99s notions of \xE2\x80\x9Canamnesis\xE2\x80\x9D and a \xE2\x80\x9Cpolycentric world church.\xE2\x80\x9D There, while appreciating some of Metz\xE2\x80\x99s leanings, Habermas comes to the defense of Athens, arguing (p.133, p.136) that \xE2\x80\x9Cprofane reason must remain skeptical about the mystical causality of a recollection inspired by the history of salvation\xE2\x80\x9D and that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe idea of a polycentric church depends in turn on insights of the European Enlightenment and its political philosophy.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Perhaps the distance separating Habermas from the first generation of Frankfurt thinkers is most clearly illustrated in an essay devoted to the work of Michael Theunissen, \xE2\x80\x9CCommunicative Freedom and Negative Theology.\xE2\x80\x9D As it happens, Theunissen\xE2\x80\x99s writings\xE2\x80\x94under Christian auspices and with a focus on Hegel transformed by Kierkegaard\xE2\x80\x94recapture in many ways the Jewish religious aspirations of that first generation. As Habermas acknowledges (p.113), Theunissen maintains trust in \xE2\x80\x9Can eschatological turning of the world\xE2\x80\x9D and tries to show philosophically \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy profane hope must be anchored in eschatological hope.\xE2\x80\x9D To buttress this view, Theunissen transforms Hegelian subjectivity into a Kierkegaardian \xE2\x80\x9Cunrepresentable singularity,\xE2\x80\x9D and Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s lateral conception of intersubjectivity into a much more open-ended, vertical relation to radical otherness. In Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s words (p.116), \xE2\x80\x9Che is convinced that every interpersonal relation is embedded in a relation to the radically Other, which precedes the relation to the concrete Other\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cembodies an absolute freedom\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94a conception that \xE2\x80\x9Ccan be traced back to elements of Jewish and Protestant mysticism.\xE2\x80\x9D In this perspective, God as the \xE2\x80\x9Cradically Other\xE2\x80\x9D is present in human history \xE2\x80\x9Cin the form of a promise, the \xE2\x80\x98anticipatory\xE2\x80\x99 present of a fulfilled future\xE2\x80\x9D which alone can redeem human suffering and despair. Countering this outlook, Habermas brings to bear a battery of considerations: first of all the \xE2\x80\x9Canthropological fact\xE2\x80\x9D (p.122) of human self-maintenance (despite despair); and secondly the Kantian notion of . <i>priori</i> conditions of possibility (saying that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe mode of successfully being a self can only be employed in a <i>hypothetical</i> way in the transcendental clarification of its conditions of possibility\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94on which basis \xE2\x80\x9Cfaith could only be justified in functional terms\xE2\x80\x9D). Finally, the essay chides Theunissen for ignoring the basic tenets of formal or universal pragmatics, which \xE2\x80\x9Call subjects must accept insofar as they orient their action towards validity claims at all\xE2\x80\x9D and which alone \xE2\x80\x9Ccan provide the normative basis for a critical theory of society\xE2\x80\x9D (p.118). Regarding Theunissen\xE2\x80\x99s trust in \xE2\x80\x9Ca transcendence irrupting into history\xE2\x80\x9D and his attempt to provide arguments supporting this trust, Habermas concludes (p.123): \xE2\x80\x9CI am unable to accept these reasons.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>My task here is not to arbitrate between Athens and Jerusalem or to judge the respective merits of rational-philosophical and religious-theological arguments. My point here was simply to cast doubt on Mendieta\xE2\x80\x99s claim of a smooth, uninterrupted continuity between the two generations of the Frankfurt School. This doubt is further reinforced by developments in another arena for which Habermas has shown little sympathy: French philosophy, especially in its deconstructive variant. As it seems to me, many of the motifs of the first generation\xE2\x80\x94appeals to eschatology and a \xE2\x80\x9Cradically Other\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94have resurfaced in recent decades in the writings of French Jewish and Christian thinkers, from Levinas to Derrida and Marion. Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s essays make no reference to Levinas, and his comments on Derrida are almost uniformly dismissive. Have motifs of the first generation thus emigrated from Frankfurt into new terrains? Whatever the answer here may be, the concern is that other issues may likewise have traveled elsewhere. I mentioned at the beginning the progressive accommodation of \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical theory\xE2\x80\x9D to American liberalism\xE2\x80\x94a trend acquiring ominous portents under the auspices of a globalized neo-liberalism. To Habermas\xE2\x80\x99s credit, there are passages in Mendieta\xE2\x80\x99s book showing awareness of these portents, as when, in the essay on Metz (p.30), he castigates \xE2\x80\x9Cthe barbaric reverse side of its own mirror\xE2\x80\x9D which Western Enlightenment has ignored for too long and which has encouraged the rise of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe stifling power of a capitalistic world civilization, which assimilates alien cultures and abandons its own traditions to oblivion.\xE2\x80\x9D However, in the later interview with Mendieta, we learn (p.153) that the current state of the world is really \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout any clearly recogniziable alternative\xE2\x80\x9D and that \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is no reasonable exit-option left to us from a capitalist world society today.\xE2\x80\x9D Although deploring the \xE2\x80\x9Cunjust distribution of good fortune in the world,\xE2\x80\x9D redress for this situation belongs for Habermas to politics and economics, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot in the cupboard of morality, let alone moral theory\xE2\x80\x9D (p.166). As he reiterates, the \xE2\x80\x9Cburning issue of a just global order\xE2\x80\x9D is basically a \xE2\x80\x9Cpolitical\xE2\x80\x9D (that is, a tactical or strategic) problem, and \xE2\x80\x9Cnot a question for moral theory\xE2\x80\x9D or discourse ethics. Does this mean that the poor and marginalized populations of the Third and Fourth World can no loner expect intellectual and ethical support for their plight from Frankfurt? In this case, the rupture between the two generations would indeed seem unbridgeable.</p>"
