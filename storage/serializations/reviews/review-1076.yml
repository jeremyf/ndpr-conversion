content: "<p>David Hoekema\xE2\x80\x99s review of Bruce Wilshire\xE2\x80\x99s latest tiresome tirade against anyone who doesn\xE2\x80\x99t do philosophy his way spends rather too much time repeating canards and slanders about me and the <i>Philosophical Gourmet Report</i> (hereafter \xE2\x80\x9CPGR\xE2\x80\x9D), a report which I have produced, with the assistance of hundreds of philosophers, for many years now. I am grateful to <i>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</i> for an opportunity to reply to these charges.</p>  \n\
  <p>(1) Professor Hoekema endorses Professor Wilshire\xE2\x80\x99s complaint that the PGR \xE2\x80\x9Cis biased strongly toward analytic approaches\xE2\x80\x9D and that analytic philosophy is my \xE2\x80\x9Cown camp\xE2\x80\x9D of philosophy. On its face, this charge is very puzzling. I am the author of one book on Nietzsche \xE2\x80\x93 a typical \xE2\x80\x9CContinental\xE2\x80\x9D figure I would have imagined \xE2\x80\x93 and the co-editor of two others; I am the author of articles on Schopenhauer, Marx, and Heidegger; I am a teacher of courses covering Hegel and Foucault. I am presently even one of two editors of <i>The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy</i>. Professor Hoekema himself ends up quoting <i>my own</i> criticisms of \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy; even <i>The New York Times</i> has quoted me to the same effect. The PGR itself gives substantial coverage to Continental philosophy, and the Advisory Board and evaluators for the PGR include many of the most distinguished scholars of Continental philosophy. Why don\xE2\x80\x99t these obvious facts give Professor Hoekema pause before accusing me and the PGR of a \xE2\x80\x9Cbias\xE2\x80\x9D towards \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy?</p>  \n\
  <p>(2) Professor Hoekema complains that \xE2\x80\x9Cone of the most troublesome examples of...misuse\xE2\x80\x9D of the PGR was the fact that the first edition of <i>Lingua Franca</i>\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Real Guide to Grad School</i> \xE2\x80\x9Crelied far too heavily on Leiter\xE2\x80\x99s often idiosyncratic ratings but failed to acknowledge their slant.\xE2\x80\x9D Of course, the fact that <i>Lingua Franca</i> relied heavily on the PGR in both the first <i>and second</i> editions of its <i>Real Guide to Grad School</i> might, in rational discourse, be taken as evidence that the PGR is not at all idiosyncratic. Indeed, the recently released second edition of the <i>Real Guide</i> (New York: Academic Partners, 2001) spends two pages rehearsing criticisms of the PGR only to undercut them all by concluding: \xE2\x80\x9CThe majority of professors the <i>Real Guide</i> contacted said that they believe the Gourmet Report is substantially accurate and valuable\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 273). <i>Lingua Franca</i>, with its close connection to the Modern Language Association and the Stony Brook Philosophy Department, hardly had any reason to be charitable on this score, yet even they could find no grounds for deeming the PGR \xE2\x80\x9Cidiosyncratic.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \n\
  <p>(3) Perhaps these misunderstandings of the PGR should not be surprising given that Professors Hoekema and Wilshire appear not to know what it is \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophers do or believe. Professor Wilshire thinks analytic philosophers, as a class, \xE2\x80\x9Cdivide the emotive from the cognitive, and the moral from the factual,\xE2\x80\x9D and that analytic philosophers now \xE2\x80\x9Cembrace \xE2\x80\x98phenomenalism.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D Professor Hoekema reports these charges without editorial comment. An exemplary professional service like <i>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</i> should not permit such a gross misrepresentation of analytic philosophy to stand. Hardly any analytic philosophers are phenomenalists, and analytic philosophers hold a myriad of views about the relationship between reason and emotion, and facts and values, with many questioning these very distinctions. One might reasonably worry that Professor Wilshire\xE2\x80\x99s sophomoric misunderstanding of what he attacks may vitiate his criticisms.</p>  \n\
  <p>(4) Professor Hoekema quotes my own assessment that \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy is mostly a stylistic category: \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy as a substantive philosophical program is long dead. (In this sense only do I plead guilty to a \xE2\x80\x9Cbias\xE2\x80\x9D in favor of \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy \xE2\x80\x93 though it might more accurately be called a \xE2\x80\x9Cbias\xE2\x80\x9D [sic] in favor of clear and rigorous scholarship.) We are now living in a \xE2\x80\x9Cgolden age\xE2\x80\x9D of scholarship on Continental philosophy, almost all of which is produced by philosophers who are \xE2\x80\x93 again, in the stylistic sense \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic.\xE2\x80\x9D Even those who are avowedly skeptical of \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D history of philosophy \xE2\x80\x93 like Frederick Beiser, one of the greatest scholars writing in English about classical German philosophy \xE2\x80\x93 are really critical of a paradigm of philosophy that died in Oxford in the 1970s; they, too, share the characteristically \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D commitment to argumentative clarity and precision. There are, to be sure, narrow-minded philosophers, with parochial views of the discipline, but being \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophers simply isn\xE2\x80\x99t what they have in common.</p>  \n\
  <p>(5) Professor Hoekema claims the misnamed \xE2\x80\x9Cpluralist\xE2\x80\x9D movement, with which Professor Wilshire is allied, \xE2\x80\x9Csucceeded.\xE2\x80\x9D But what is the evidence \xE2\x80\x93 beyond the dilution in quality of one of the three annual meetings of the APA \xE2\x80\x93 for this extraordinary claim? \xE2\x80\x9CToday,\xE2\x80\x9D says Professor Hoekema, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe annual meeting of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy [SPEP] is one of the largest philosophical gatherings in the country.\xE2\x80\x9D But the roughly 300 participants who attend a typical SPEP annual meeting include a significant contingent (judging from recent programs, perhaps as much as a third) who don\xE2\x80\x99t teach in philosophy departments, while the philosophers come overwhelmingly from less than 20 departments in the entire United States. Professor Wilshire, like SPEP, speaks for that small minority of academic philosophers who have been bypassed by the collapse of a substantive dispute between analytic and Continental philosophy, and the concomitant and dramatic improvement in scholarly and intellectual standards for serious work on Continental philosophy that has resulted. Mediocre academics can no longer hide behind the fig leaf of \xE2\x80\x9CContinental philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D to explain why \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophers don\xE2\x80\x99t take them seriously \xE2\x80\x93 certainly not when the bastions of \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy like Princeton, Oxford, Cambridge, London, Pittsburgh, Stanford, Michigan, etc. all now hire scholars of Continental philosophy. (None of these programs hired \xE2\x80\x9Cpluralists\xE2\x80\x9D or SPEP members, by the way.)</p>  \n\
  <p>(6) As Professor Hoekema notes, Professor Wilshire \xE2\x80\x9Cattributes great influence [to the PGR] among administrators as well as prospective students....\xE2\x80\x9D This, I believe, is what really has Wilshire and his \xE2\x80\x9Cpluralist\xE2\x80\x9D colleagues agitated. A Continental philosophy scholar has produced a report on graduate study in philosophy, with the help of hundreds of philosophers, many of them also scholars of Continental philosophy. That report now gets 10,000 hits per month on the Web, and has had a significant impact on the decisions made by prospective students and administrators. This has been a catastrophe for the self-anointed bastions of \xE2\x80\x9Cpluralism,\xE2\x80\x9D which do not fare well in the PGR, but which also have depended on the bogeyman of \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy for so long to explain their marginal status. (The \xE2\x80\x9Cpluralists\xE2\x80\x9D now account for nearly half the signatories of the on-line letter protesting the PGR, a letter which after nearly a year has garnered a mere 2% of the entire profession as signatories.) It turns out, however, that the bogeyman is dead, and that the \xE2\x80\x9Cpluralists\xE2\x80\x9D are actually just marginal to philosophy, \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CContinental\xE2\x80\x9D. When Professor Wilshire recommends, as he did in his last book on <i>The Primal Roots of American Philosophy</i> (2000), that philosophers need to appreciate shaman healing practices, he is not a philosophical pluralist, but simply a philosophical outlier, with no connection or relevance to any of the many glorious traditions in philosophy, from Aristotle to Nietzsche, from Descartes to Quine, from Hume to Husserl. Those who suffer from their powerlessness and marginalization, Nietzsche understood, also typically suffer from a peculiar emotion, which Nietzsche called <i>ressentiment</i>. That emotion, I fear, is now on furious display in the reckless polemics of Professor Wilshire.</p>"
