content: "<p>In <i>The Coast of Utopia</i>, Alexander Herzen muses aloud about the course of human history. Asking, \xE2\x80\x9CWhere is the unity, the meaning, of nature\xE2\x80\x99s highest creation?\xE2\x80\x9D Herzen offers this oracular response: \xE2\x80\x9CSurely those millions of little streams of accident and wilfulness have their correction in the vast underground river which, without a doubt, is carrying us to the place where we\xE2\x80\x99re expected! But there is no such place, that\xE2\x80\x99s why it\xE2\x80\x99s called utopia.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"1b\" href=\"#1\">1</a></sup> Tom Stoppard\xE2\x80\x99s evocation of the millenarian <i>Zeitgeist</i> in his remarkable trilogy finds an enigmatic echo in Yvonne Sherratt\xE2\x80\x99s attempt to unearth a positive thesis in Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s forbiddingly negative critical theory. According to Sherratt, Adorno does sight the coast of utopia. Yet his utopia is neither situated in any place nor realizable at any point in time. Indeed, Sherratt argues that Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s critical theory is teleological precisely because he believes that the subterranean flow of history courses towards an aim that is simultaneously \xE2\x80\x9Cunrealised and unrealisable.\xE2\x80\x9D This new Erewhon is enlightenment (44), or \xE2\x80\x9Cthe \xE2\x80\x98good\xE2\x80\x99 society governed by genuine reason\xE2\x80\x9D (19).</p>  \n\
  <p>Sherratt wants to challenge existing interpretations of Adorno as an unrepentant pessimist with her thesis that Adorno offers a positive notion of enlightenment as the inherently unrealisable telos of human history. She focuses on <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>, <i>Minima Moralia</i>, <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, and <i>Aesthetic Theory</i> to support her contention that Adorno outlines a \xE2\x80\x9Csystematic Utopian thesis\xE2\x80\x9D (13) based on a largely Freudian conception of the human soul or human nature. Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s utopianism \xE2\x80\x9Cconsists of incorporating aesthetic experience into all the foundational dimensions of human life, including reason itself\xE2\x80\x9D (17). Acknowledging the centrality of Marx in Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s thought (35-8), Sherratt nonetheless wants to counter what she perceives as a widespread bias \xE2\x80\x9Ctowards an examination of the Marxist influence\xE2\x80\x9D (14) by highlighting Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s debt to Freud and his psychoanalytic concepts of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe ego and id, maturity and immaturity\xE2\x80\x9D (68-9). That Adorno sketches a positive dialectical relationship between id and ego instincts is one of Sherratt\xE2\x80\x99s central theses, though she readily concedes that her interpretation builds upon \xE2\x80\x9Cthoughts that Adorno alludes to but has not himself systematically developed\xE2\x80\x9D (146).</p>  \n\
  <p>Id and ego instincts can only relate to one other dialectically if each offers its own unique cognitive purchase on objects. Consequently, as she develops her view that Adorno has a dialectical conception of this relationship, Sherratt contests Freud\xE2\x80\x99s claim that the id instincts are solely \xE2\x80\x9Cresponsible for the (absolutely non-cognitive) pleasurable engagement of the Subject with the Object.\xE2\x80\x9D To demonstrate that Adorno believes the id instincts are geared towards the acquisition of knowledge, Sherratt cites a passage from <i>Minima Moralia</i> where Adorno criticizes Freud for turning reason into \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98a mere superstructure\xE2\x80\x99.\xE2\x80\x9D Against this conception of reason as epiphenomenal, Sherratt contends not only that Adorno grounds reason in the id instincts but also that the relationship between the id and its objects has the same features as aesthetic knowledge acquisition. She concludes from this discussion that the id instincts are oriented towards knowledge acquisition (210-11).</p>  \n\
  <p>Unfortunately, this argument is problematic on logical grounds. For one cannot infer directly from either (or both) of these claims that the id instincts themselves are cognitively oriented. The argument is flawed on the hermeneutic level as well because Adorno actually grounds reason in the ego instinct of self-preservation. <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>\xE2\x80\x93a central text for Sherratt\xE2\x80\x93advances the speculative anthropological claim that Western rationality first emerged in response to threats posed by external nature. Reason originally developed as an organ of adaptation to an environment perceived as hostile. Adorno stresses the relationship between reason and self-preservation in his later work as well: \xE2\x80\x9C<i>Ratio</i> came into being in the first place as an instrument of self-preservation, that of reality-testing.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> But he also warns that the more uninhibitedly reason \xE2\x80\x9Cturns itself into the absolute opposite of nature and forgets nature in itself, all the more will a self-preservation gone wild regress into nature.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"3b\" href=\"#3\">3</a></sup> In fact, it is just this regression of self-preservation that accounts for the negative aspects of enlightenment; self-preservation has \xE2\x80\x9Cgone wild\xE2\x80\x9D because it now unleashes destructive tendencies that threaten the lives of the very subjects it is meant to preserve.</p>  \n\
  <p>Sherratt follows her controversial claim about the dialectical relationship between the id and ego instincts with the argument that aesthetic knowledge acquisition \xE2\x80\x9Chas its basis in the aspect of the self that is the id instincts\xE2\x80\x9D (211), while instrumental knowledge is grounded in the ego instincts. Adorno outlines a positive dialectical thesis because instrumental and aesthetic reason are related to each other in such a way that they may supplement each other, thereby giving rise to a more flexible mode of cognition which lends a voice to objects in their concrete, material <i>haecceity</i> rather than merely subsuming them coercively under concepts or conceptual systems in the identificatory fashion that Adorno condemns throughout his work. As an antidote to rigid identificatory thought\xE2\x80\x93which, as Sherratt persuasively argues, constantly risks a decline into animism\xE2\x80\x93Adorno offers this new dialectical mode of thought that \xE2\x80\x9C<i>retains</i> precision, clarity, and distinctness and <i>negates</i> rigidity\xE2\x80\x9D (138-9).</p>  \n\
  <p>Sharrett\xE2\x80\x99s claim about the dialectical relationship between instrumental and aesthetic knowledge acquisition is largely based on an interpretation of one sentence in <i>Negative Dialectics</i>: \xE2\x80\x9Cart and philosophy . . . both keep faith with their own substance through their opposites.\xE2\x80\x9D In a series of elisions, Sherratt equates philosophy with instrumental reason, which she then interprets as the opposite of art, thereby attempting to ground her view that instrumental reason can be played off dialectically against aesthetic reason (190). What is most problematic here is Sherratt\xE2\x80\x99s conflation of philosophy with instrumental reason. In the sentence she quotes, Adorno actually contrasts his own non-instrumental philosophy, or critical theory, with art. Moreover, he does not maintain that there is a dialectical relationship between philosophy and art such that art can supplement philosophy in the way Sherratt claims. If philosophy \xE2\x80\x9Cwill not abandon the yearning that animates the nonconceptual side of art,\xE2\x80\x9D it must remain faithful to its own conceptual substance. Even though the concept \xE2\x80\x9Cnegates that yearning,\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy can neither circumvent this negation, nor submit to it. Rather, it \xE2\x80\x9Cmust strive, by way of the concept, to transcend the concept\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ND</i>, 15).</p>  \n\
  <p>In <i>Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics</i>, also published recently by Cambridge University Press, J. M. Bernstein makes a sophisticated attempt to explain what Adorno means by striving to transcend concepts by way of concepts. Unfortunately, Sherratt makes no reference to this book in developing her thesis about Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s positive dialectic. At the very least, she might have heeded the emphasis he places on the ethical dimension of Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s thought, along with his warning that \xE2\x80\x9Cto displace reason with aesthetic praxis and judgement\xE2\x80\x9D constitutes a \xE2\x80\x9Cmassive misunderstanding and distortion\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"4b\" href=\"#4\">4</a></sup> of Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s work. Sherratt wants to supplement instrumental identity thinking with an aesthetic mode of identification owing to the failure of non-identity thinking to serve as an adequate corrective to identity thinking. While convincingly documenting this failure in Chapter Four, Sherratt could have overcome it by developing Gillian Rose\xE2\x80\x99s claim that Adorno postulates a rational mode of identity thinking. To cite Rose, rational identity thinking involves the use of concepts to refer to the ideal conditions of an object\xE2\x80\x99s existence. Rose calls this \xE2\x80\x9Cthe <i>utopian</i> aspect of identifying.\xE2\x80\x9D She adds: \xE2\x80\x9CFor the concept to identify its object in this sense the particular object would have to have all the properties of its ideal state.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"5b\" href=\"#5\">5</a></sup> </p>  \n\
  <p>Both Rose and Bernstein have convincingly argued that the salient feature of Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s thought is its ethical dimension. Indeed, one of the central problems that awaits an interpretive solution in Adorno scholarship is the relationship between the epistemological, ethical, and aesthetic dimensions of his thought. More to the point, when Sherratt claims that the nonconceptual, absorptive identification that characterizes aesthetic reason \xE2\x80\x9Callows us to be receptive to the fact that the object has a sense of self\xE2\x80\x9D (180), she supplements instrumental thinking with the aesthetic loss of self in the \xE2\x80\x9Cselfhood\xE2\x80\x9D of objects such that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe <i>Subject</i> himself .. . is <i>incorporated into the Object</i>.\xE2\x80\x9D Aesthetic identification consists in \xE2\x80\x9C<i>the Subject becoming like the Object</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (173). Yet such absorption would not only involve a highly contentious identification with the very objects that Adorno describes throughout his work as fundamentally damaged; it would also not permit the subject to recognize this damage as damage. To identify uncritically with damaged life certainly does not bode well, even for an inherently unrealizable utopia. In fact, Adorno characterizes his dialectical mode of thought as an ethical endeavour that attempts both to make good on the damage inflicted on objects under existing conditions (<i>ND</i>, 19) and to transcend concepts by using concepts.</p>  \n\
  <p>Adorno also states that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe means employed in negative dialectics for the penetration of its hardened [<i>verh\xC3\xA4rteten</i>] objects is possibility\xE2\x80\x93the possibility of which reality has cheated the objects and which is nonetheless visible in each one\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ND</i>, 52). Indeed, he explicitly defines utopia as the \xE2\x80\x9Cconsciousness of possibility that sticks to the concrete, the undisfigured\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ND</i>, 56-7). The positive, utopian dimension of his thought consists in its conceptual invocation of the emphatic possibilities that glimmer faintly in damaged reality. These utopian possibilities are by no means exhausted in a dialectical conception of subjectivity, as Sherratt implies when she focuses exclusively on the subjective, psychological, and Freudian dimension of Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s theory to the exclusion of its predominantly Marxist thrust. The utopian goal of critical thought is \xE2\x80\x9Cto abolish the hierarchy,\xE2\x80\x9D not only between the thinking subject and its objects, the ego and the id, but also between society and the individual (<i>ND</i>, 181). If enlightened and mature subjects constitute an enlightened society, it is equally the case that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe subject of <i>ratio</i> pursuing its self-preservation is itself an actual universal, society\xE2\x80\x93in its full logic, humanity.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"6b\" href=\"#6\">6</a></sup> </p>  \n\
  <p>This utopian vision obviously remains unrealized today. Is it, however, unrealizable in the sense that history is carrying us to a place that does not exist and never will exist? Are we really going straight to nowhere? Martin Jay convincingly demonstrates that Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s is not a straightforwardly teleological view of history.<sup><a name=\"7b\" href=\"#7\">7</a></sup> Indeed, Sherratt simply contradicts herself when she argues that Adorno has a teleological conception of history that is simultaneously \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-developmental\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Chas no end point\xE2\x80\x9D (67). Expressing profound doubt on countless occasions about prospects for realizing the emphatic goal of an enlightened society, Adorno never conceived of this goal as the telos of history. Rather, he famously postulated a line of historical development that leads from \xE2\x80\x9Cthe slingshot to the megaton bomb.\xE2\x80\x9D To the extent that history exhibits a pattern, it is one of universal social regression\xE2\x80\x93not one that leads from \xE2\x80\x9Csavagery to humanitarianism\xE2\x80\x9D(<i>ND</i>, 320). In <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, then, Adorno not only rejects the idea that history follows a subterranean course towards enlightenment, he sometimes seems to adopt a dystopian conception of history. Although there are moments when he also suggests that history could take a dramatic turn for the better, Adorno often appears to bequeath to his readers the same dark legacy that Herzen bestows upon his son: \xE2\x80\x9CThe coming revolution is the only religion I pass on to you, and it\xE2\x80\x99s a religion without a paradise on the other shore. But do not remain on this shore. Better to perish.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"8b\" href=\"#8\">8</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

Indeed, Sherratt argues that Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s critical theory is teleological precisely because he believes that the subterranean flow of history courses towards an aim that is simultaneously \xE2\x80\x9Cunrealised and unrealisable.\xE2\x80\x9D This new Erewhon is enlightenment (44), or \xE2\x80\x9Cthe \xE2\x80\x98good\xE2\x80\x99 society governed by genuine reason\xE2\x80\x9D (19).</p>  \n\
  <p>Sherratt wants to challenge existing interpretations of Adorno as an unrepentant pessimist with her thesis that Adorno offers a positive notion of enlightenment as the inherently unrealisable telos of human history. She focuses on <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>, <i>Minima Moralia</i>, <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, and <i>Aesthetic Theory</i> to support her contention that Adorno outlines a \xE2\x80\x9Csystematic Utopian thesis\xE2\x80\x9D (13) based on a largely Freudian conception of the human soul or human nature. Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s utopianism \xE2\x80\x9Cconsists of incorporating aesthetic experience into all the foundational dimensions of human life, including reason itself\xE2\x80\x9D (17). Acknowledging the centrality of Marx in Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s thought (35-8), Sherratt nonetheless wants to counter what she perceives as a widespread bias \xE2\x80\x9Ctowards an examination of the Marxist influence\xE2\x80\x9D (14) by highlighting Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s debt to Freud and his psychoanalytic concepts of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe ego and id, maturity and immaturity\xE2\x80\x9D (68-9). That Adorno sketches a positive dialectical relationship between id and ego instincts is one of Sherratt\xE2\x80\x99s central theses, though she readily concedes that her interpretation builds upon \xE2\x80\x9Cthoughts that Adorno alludes to but has not himself systematically developed\xE2\x80\x9D (146).</p>  \n\
  <p>Id and ego instincts can only relate to one other dialectically if each offers its own unique cognitive purchase on objects. Consequently, as she develops her view that Adorno has a dialectical conception of this relationship, Sherratt contests Freud\xE2\x80\x99s claim that the id instincts are solely \xE2\x80\x9Cresponsible for the (absolutely non-cognitive) pleasurable engagement of the Subject with the Object.\xE2\x80\x9D To demonstrate that Adorno believes the id instincts are geared towards the acquisition of knowledge, Sherratt cites a passage from <i>Minima Moralia</i> where Adorno criticizes Freud for turning reason into \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98a mere superstructure\xE2\x80\x99.\xE2\x80\x9D Against this conception of reason as epiphenomenal, Sherratt contends not only that Adorno grounds reason in the id instincts but also that the relationship between the id and its objects has the same features as aesthetic knowledge acquisition. She concludes from this discussion that the id instincts are oriented towards knowledge acquisition (210-11).</p>  \n\
  <p>Unfortunately, this argument is problematic on logical grounds. For one cannot infer directly from either (or both) of these claims that the id instincts themselves are cognitively oriented. The argument is flawed on the hermeneutic level as well because Adorno actually grounds reason in the ego instinct of self-preservation. <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>\xE2\x80\x93a central text for Sherratt\xE2\x80\x93advances the speculative anthropological claim that Western rationality first emerged in response to threats posed by external nature. Reason originally developed as an organ of adaptation to an environment perceived as hostile. Adorno stresses the relationship between reason and self-preservation in his later work as well: \xE2\x80\x9C<i>Ratio</i> came into being in the first place as an instrument of self-preservation, that of reality-testing.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> But he also warns that the more uninhibitedly reason \xE2\x80\x9Cturns itself into the absolute opposite of nature and forgets nature in itself, all the more will a self-preservation gone wild regress into nature.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"3b\" href=\"#3\">3</a></sup> In fact, it is just this regression of self-preservation that accounts for the negative aspects of enlightenment; self-preservation has \xE2\x80\x9Cgone wild\xE2\x80\x9D because it now unleashes destructive tendencies that threaten the lives of the very subjects it is meant to preserve.</p>  \n\
  <p>Sherratt follows her controversial claim about the dialectical relationship between the id and ego instincts with the argument that aesthetic knowledge acquisition \xE2\x80\x9Chas its basis in the aspect of the self that is the id instincts\xE2\x80\x9D (211), while instrumental knowledge is grounded in the ego instincts. Adorno outlines a positive dialectical thesis because instrumental and aesthetic reason are related to each other in such a way that they may supplement each other, thereby giving rise to a more flexible mode of cognition which lends a voice to objects in their concrete, material <i>haecceity</i> rather than merely subsuming them coercively under concepts or conceptual systems in the identificatory fashion that Adorno condemns throughout his work. As an antidote to rigid identificatory thought\xE2\x80\x93which, as Sherratt persuasively argues, constantly risks a decline into animism\xE2\x80\x93Adorno offers this new dialectical mode of thought that \xE2\x80\x9C<i>retains</i> precision, clarity, and distinctness and <i>negates</i> rigidity\xE2\x80\x9D (138-9).</p>  \n\
  <p>Sharrett\xE2\x80\x99s claim about the dialectical relationship between instrumental and aesthetic knowledge acquisition is largely based on an interpretation of one sentence in <i>Negative Dialectics</i>: \xE2\x80\x9Cart and philosophy . . . both keep faith with their own substance through their opposites.\xE2\x80\x9D In a series of elisions, Sherratt equates philosophy with instrumental reason, which she then interprets as the opposite of art, thereby attempting to ground her view that instrumental reason can be played off dialectically against aesthetic reason (190). What is most problematic here is Sherratt\xE2\x80\x99s conflation of philosophy with instrumental reason. In the sentence she quotes, Adorno actually contrasts his own non-instrumental philosophy, or critical theory, with art. Moreover, he does not maintain that there is a dialectical relationship between philosophy and art such that art can supplement philosophy in the way Sherratt claims. If philosophy \xE2\x80\x9Cwill not abandon the yearning that animates the nonconceptual side of art,\xE2\x80\x9D it must remain faithful to its own conceptual substance. Even though the concept \xE2\x80\x9Cnegates that yearning,\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy can neither circumvent this negation, nor submit to it. Rather, it \xE2\x80\x9Cmust strive, by way of the concept, to transcend the concept\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ND</i>, 15).</p>  \n\
  <p>In <i>Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics</i>, also published recently by Cambridge University Press, J. M. Bernstein makes a sophisticated attempt to explain what Adorno means by striving to transcend concepts by way of concepts. Unfortunately, Sherratt makes no reference to this book in developing her thesis about Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s positive dialectic. At the very least, she might have heeded the emphasis he places on the ethical dimension of Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s thought, along with his warning that \xE2\x80\x9Cto displace reason with aesthetic praxis and judgement\xE2\x80\x9D constitutes a \xE2\x80\x9Cmassive misunderstanding and distortion\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"4b\" href=\"#4\">4</a></sup> of Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s work. Sherratt wants to supplement instrumental identity thinking with an aesthetic mode of identification owing to the failure of non-identity thinking to serve as an adequate corrective to identity thinking. While convincingly documenting this failure in Chapter Four, Sherratt could have overcome it by developing Gillian Rose\xE2\x80\x99s claim that Adorno postulates a rational mode of identity thinking. To cite Rose, rational identity thinking involves the use of concepts to refer to the ideal conditions of an object\xE2\x80\x99s existence. Rose calls this \xE2\x80\x9Cthe <i>utopian</i> aspect of identifying.\xE2\x80\x9D She adds: \xE2\x80\x9CFor the concept to identify its object in this sense the particular object would have to have all the properties of its ideal state.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"5b\" href=\"#5\">5</a></sup> </p>  \n\
  <p>Both Rose and Bernstein have convincingly argued that the salient feature of Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s thought is its ethical dimension. Indeed, one of the central problems that awaits an interpretive solution in Adorno scholarship is the relationship between the epistemological, ethical, and aesthetic dimensions of his thought. More to the point, when Sherratt claims that the nonconceptual, absorptive identification that characterizes aesthetic reason \xE2\x80\x9Callows us to be receptive to the fact that the object has a sense of self\xE2\x80\x9D (180), she supplements instrumental thinking with the aesthetic loss of self in the \xE2\x80\x9Cselfhood\xE2\x80\x9D of objects such that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe <i>Subject</i> himself .. . is <i>incorporated into the Object</i>.\xE2\x80\x9D Aesthetic identification consists in \xE2\x80\x9C<i>the Subject becoming like the Object</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (173). Yet such absorption would not only involve a highly contentious identification with the very objects that Adorno describes throughout his work as fundamentally damaged; it would also not permit the subject to recognize this damage as damage. To identify uncritically with damaged life certainly does not bode well, even for an inherently unrealizable utopia. In fact, Adorno characterizes his dialectical mode of thought as an ethical endeavour that attempts both to make good on the damage inflicted on objects under existing conditions (<i>ND</i>, 19) and to transcend concepts by using concepts.</p>  \n\
  <p>Adorno also states that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe means employed in negative dialectics for the penetration of its hardened [<i>verh\xC3\xA4rteten</i>] objects is possibility\xE2\x80\x93the possibility of which reality has cheated the objects and which is nonetheless visible in each one\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ND</i>, 52). Indeed, he explicitly defines utopia as the \xE2\x80\x9Cconsciousness of possibility that sticks to the concrete, the undisfigured\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>ND</i>, 56-7). The positive, utopian dimension of his thought consists in its conceptual invocation of the emphatic possibilities that glimmer faintly in damaged reality. These utopian possibilities are by no means exhausted in a dialectical conception of subjectivity, as Sherratt implies when she focuses exclusively on the subjective, psychological, and Freudian dimension of Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s theory to the exclusion of its predominantly Marxist thrust. The utopian goal of critical thought is \xE2\x80\x9Cto abolish the hierarchy,\xE2\x80\x9D not only between the thinking subject and its objects, the ego and the id, but also between society and the individual (<i>ND</i>, 181). If enlightened and mature subjects constitute an enlightened society, it is equally the case that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe subject of <i>ratio</i> pursuing its self-preservation is itself an actual universal, society\xE2\x80\x93in its full logic, humanity.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"6b\" href=\"#6\">6</a></sup> </p>  \n\
  <p>This utopian vision obviously remains unrealized today. Is it, however, unrealizable in the sense that history is carrying us to a place that does not exist and never will exist? Are we really going straight to nowhere? Martin Jay convincingly demonstrates that Adorno\xE2\x80\x99s is not a straightforwardly teleological view of history.<sup><a name=\"7b\" href=\"#7\">7</a></sup> Indeed, Sherratt simply contradicts herself when she argues that Adorno has a teleological conception of history that is simultaneously \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-developmental\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Chas no end point\xE2\x80\x9D (67). Expressing profound doubt on countless occasions about prospects for realizing the emphatic goal of an enlightened society, Adorno never conceived of this goal as the telos of history. Rather, he famously postulated a line of historical development that leads from \xE2\x80\x9Cthe slingshot to the megaton bomb.\xE2\x80\x9D To the extent that history exhibits a pattern, it is one of universal social regression\xE2\x80\x93not one that leads from \xE2\x80\x9Csavagery to humanitarianism\xE2\x80\x9D(<i>ND</i>, 320). In <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, then, Adorno not only rejects the idea that history follows a subterranean course towards enlightenment, he sometimes seems to adopt a dystopian conception of history. Although there are moments when he also suggests that history could take a dramatic turn for the better, Adorno often appears to bequeath to his readers the same dark legacy that Herzen bestows upon his son: \xE2\x80\x9CThe coming revolution is the only religion I pass on to you, and it\xE2\x80\x99s a religion without a paradise on the other shore. But do not remain on this shore. Better to perish.\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"8b\" href=\"#8\">8</a></sup><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
