content: "<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">McGinn's new book gathers together his essays on consciousness from about the last ten years, as well as a number of other essays written expressly for the purpose.<span style=\"\">   </span>It is, he says, a sequel to his earlier <i>The Problem of Consciousness </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">(Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1991) and certainly the themes here deepen and extend the position familiar from that book: the mysterian view--as it has come to be known--that the limits of human knowledge have an impact on the problem of consciousness, and indeed on a lot of other problems besides. The essays exhibit the features with which readers of McGinn's work will be familiar: the clarity and relaxedness of his writing, the imagination, the tenacity in following arguments to their conclusion.<span style=\"\">   </span>Overall, the collection is both intellectually substantial and fun to read--very impressive. </span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Here is how things are organized.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapters 1-3 are essays directly on the problem of consciousness.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 1 offers a diagnosis of the source of the problem, suggesting it arises because of a certain conceptual fact, namely that one cannot have the concept of experience without being acquainted--in some sense--with experience.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 2 argues against those who appeal to the necessary <i>a posteriori</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> in responding to the problem of consciousness.<span style=\"\">  </span>Here McGinn advances a version of the property dualism argument familiar in particular from Stephen White's paper \"Curse of the Qualia\" (</span><i>Synthese</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 68:1986: 333-68). In Chapter 3 McGinn reminds us that, in his well-known article \"Can we solve the mind-body problem?\"--the central paper of the 1991 book--his answer to the title-question is 'yes and no'--'yes' to the philosophical problem, 'no' to the empirical question.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapters 4-6 focus more on the notion of matter.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 4 suggests that, in view of the nature of identity, if pain is subjective then so to is the firing of c-fibers, if pain = c-fibers firing.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 5 discusses the relation of consciousness to space, suggesting that any sort of reductionism about consciousness must involve a new conception of space.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 6 is an interesting discussion of atomism, in which McGinn casts himself as a modern-day Democritus, conjecturing that (mental) atomism is true in advance of having any specific evidence for it.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapters 7-10 are bit miscellaneous.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 7 is a dialogue between two world-views, McGinn's and an alternative whose leading idea is that the brain acts as sort of transmitter between a world of matter and a world of spirit.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 8 offers a brief statement of McGinn's views about philosophical problems; in effect the chapter is a pr\xC3\xA9cis of his 1993 book, </span><i>Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Enquiry</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (Oxford, 1993).<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 9 argues against various first-person-authority theses.<span style=\"\">  </span>As McGinn notes, the basic argument of this chapter is inconsistent with that of chapter 1, an inconsistency he then struggles to resolve. Finally, chapter 10 takes up the analysis of perception.<span style=\"\">  </span>McGinn states his position here by saying that, according to it, there are non-existent objects.<span style=\"\">  </span>This sounds a bit startling, but as McGinn himself points out, all that is really intended is that there are true perceptual reports of the form 's perceives o' wherein 'o' does not refer; that is,<span style=\"\">  </span>'s perceives o' should be thought of as similar to 's is thinking of o'.<span style=\"\">  </span>Whether this latter idea is helpfully summarized in the slogan 'there are non-existent objects' seems to me open to question.</span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">With so many themes covered there is much to discuss.<span style=\"\">  </span>Still, reading the book and thinking through the issues for my own purposes, I was continually struck by the following simple objection to McGinn's mysterianism--an objection that unfortunately does not seem to me to be discussed in any explicit way in his work.<span style=\"\">  </span>The objection is, roughly, that, while the claim of ignorance is in the context true (or at any rate plausible), it is also irrelevant.<span style=\"\">  </span>\"Of course we might be ignorant of many things, and perhaps even chronically so\", the critic will say, \"but this has no effect on such first-base philosophical questions as 'what, if anything, is wrong with the conceivability argument against materialism?' For these arguments can be stated in such a way that the fact of ignorance--assuming it to be a fact--can be abstracted away from for the purposes of discussion.\"</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Why is it that the fact of ignorance can be abstracted away from?<span style=\"\">  </span>\"We might be ignorant of many things\" the critic will continue \"but at least we know that the truths, concepts, facts (etc.) of which we are ignorant are, if non-experiential or physical, then (e.g.) <i>objective</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.<span style=\"\">  </span>But an argument that has the persuasive force of the conceivability argument can be formulated about the relation between the experiential and the </span><i>unknown</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> objective, just as much as between the experiential and the</span><i> known </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">objective, for the contrast that lies at the heart of the problem is that between the experiential and the objective.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Another way to make the point is this. Imagine I am trying to convince you that numbers are colored.<span style=\"\">  </span>When you point out to me that numbers don't seem to be the sort of things that are colored, it is no good my saying that there are or might be numbers of which we are ignorant.<span style=\"\">  </span>Unknown numbers are still numbers after all; hence our ignorance of some numbers is irrelevant to the assessment of my position.</span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Of course the proponent of this objection is not saying that the conceivability argument <i>is</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> sound; perhaps it is not.<span style=\"\">  </span>The objection is open as much to the analytic functionalist as to the dualist.<span style=\"\">  </span>But what the objection shows, if successful, is that, any appeal to ignorance is irrelevant to the philosophical issues raised by the argument.<span style=\"\">  </span>Hence, to the extent that our interest is in the evaluation of the conceivability argument (and similar arguments such as the knowledge argument and the explanatory-gap argument), we may as well operate as if all the facts are in.<span style=\"\">  </span>To put it another way, mysterianism does </span><i>not</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> have the effect McGinn says it will, viz., change our thinking about consciousness in such a way that we will no longer feel the pull of (what he calls) the DIME structure, i.e. the tendency to adopt one of a </span><i>d</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">eflationist reductionist option, an outright </span><i>i</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">rreducibility option, an eerily </span><i>m</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">agical option, or an ontological </span><i>e</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">limination option.<span style=\"\">  </span>If the objection I just stated is sound, consciousness </span><i>is</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> a dime-store mystery after all. </span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">How to respond? I see four main possibilities, but none of them sits comfortably with McGinn's overall position.<span style=\"\">  </span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The first is to adopt what I will call <b>anti-naturalist mysterianism (AM)</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">.<span style=\"\">   </span>The anti-naturalist mysterian responds to the argument above by conceding it and conceding that experiences are not reducible to anything else--that is what makes it anti-naturalist.<span style=\"\">  </span>But AM retains an element of mysterianism in that the precise relation between the physical and irreducible experiences eludes us. AM seems to me to be the leading idea in the post-<i>The View from Nowhere</i></span> (OUP, 1986) Nagel, as well as in Jackson's brief discussion of mysterianism in his 'Epiphenomenal Qualia' (<i>Philosophical Quarterly</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, 32: 127-36), which McGinn refers to here on p 12.<span style=\"\">  </span>But NM cannot be McGinn's view, and the reason is precisely his naturalism. Naturalism means all things to all people, but in this context it means that experiences are not irreducible. McGinn is resolutely opposed to irreducibilty--as his opposition to the dime-shape makes clear--and so AM is not his view. </span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The next possibility is to adopt what I will call <b>revisionist mysterianism (RM)</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">.<span style=\"\">  </span>The revisionist mysterian responds to the argument by conceding that it is right--<i>so long as one adopts the standard interpretation of objectivity</i></span>.<span style=\"\">  </span>But--the revisionist continues--there might be a new and different understanding of objectivity according to which the argument fails.<span style=\"\">  </span>The element of mysterianism remains insofar as we are ignorant of what this alternative conception might be.<span style=\"\">  </span>McGinn himself seems to suggest RM when he says<span style=\"\">  </span>(p.91) \"maybe mental states are reducible to something that does not have the marks of full-blown objectivity\". But on reflection it is as difficult to attribute RM to McGinn as AM.<span style=\"\">  </span>The problem this time is that RM does not differ from a standard form of eliminativism or reductionism.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is a commonplace that reductions might involve the reassessment and re-interpretation of the concepts involved.<span style=\"\">  </span>So at this point the mysterianism seems not to be an alternative to the dime shape.<span style=\"\">  </span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The third possibility is to adopt what I will call <b>transcendental mysterianism (TM)</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, according to which there is a third sort of fact or truth, neither subjective nor objective.<span style=\"\">  </span>Now, in the sense that is at issue in these discussions, an objective truth or fact is one that can be understood from more than one point of view, and a subjective truth or fact is one that can be understood from only one point of view.<span style=\"\">  </span>Given this, the only way in which a truth can be neither objective nor subjective is if it cannot be understood at all.<span style=\"\">  </span>So the suggestion of transcendental mysterianism is that the objection I stated fails because that there are truths that cannot be known even in principle and that these entail both the truths that are objective and those that are subjective. Is TM McGinn's view?<span style=\"\">  </span>Well, again there are passages which suggest it; for example in the sentence following the one quoted in the previous paragraph he says \"maybe new properties could be discovered which reduce mental states and are not themselves objective\" (p.91). But again it is difficult to attribute TM to McGinn.<span style=\"\">  </span>The reason this time is that the overall impression one gets from his writing is not that the truths in question could not be understood <i>at all</i></span> but that they may be--to use his own word--discovered.<span style=\"\">  </span>But such a discovery is ruled out by TM--that is what makes it transcendental.<span style=\"\">   </span>In fact, this is also what makes it controversial, for it is far from clear that there <i>are</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> any of the truths that the transcendental mysterian says there are.<span style=\"\">  </span>Of course there are truths that cannot be understood by someone or other.<span style=\"\">  </span>But are there truths that cannot be understood </span><i>period</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">? </span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The final possibility is to adopt what I will call <b>deflationist mysterianism (DM)</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">. According to this view, the premise of the objection above is false in this sense: it is not the case that the problem will re-emerge whenever you contrast the experiential with the objective.<span style=\"\">  </span>The guiding thought is that the source of the problem is epistemic rather than conceptual; hence, once the ignorance is taken away, so too is the problem. However, DM is not going to appeal to McGinn either.<span style=\"\">  </span>As we have seen, in his first chapter, he suggests that the source of the problem is conceptual, and throughout he insists that consciousness is subjective and not objective.<span style=\"\">  </span>Hence, while McGinn's view is in a sense deflationary, as he says (e.g, p. 70), it is not deflationary in <i>this</i></span> sense. In fact, this is the really strange thing about McGinn's position. You would think that someone who emphasises ignorance in the way that McGinn does would think that the source of the philosophical problem of conciousness is ignorance.<span style=\"\">  </span>But this is not his view. </p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">In sum, when faced with the 'plausible but irrelevant' objection McGinn faces a series of unappealing options.<span style=\"\">  </span>As I read him, he wants to advance a version of mysterianism that is naturalistic, non-transcendental, non-deflationary (in the sense described) and yet <i>is</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> an alternative to the dime-shape.
