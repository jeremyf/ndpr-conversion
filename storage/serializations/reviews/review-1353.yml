content: "<p>Lenny Moss\xE2\x80\x99s <i>What Genes Can\xE2\x80\x99t Do</i> is an important contribution to the on-going project of moving the organism back to the center stage of biology, both conceptually and as the primary locus for empirical research. The book is a true example of work in the history <i>and</i> philosophy of biology, moving with ease between historical analyses, contemporary philosophical debates, and recent biological research. Briefly, Moss argues that the language of the genome as the repository of \xE2\x80\x99information\xE2\x80\x99 and as the \xE2\x80\x99controller\xE2\x80\x99 of organismal development emerges from a historical conflation of two independently legitimate but jointly incoherent conceptions of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe gene.\xE2\x80\x9D This confusion, Moss argues, has had important implications for both basic and applied biological research: it has had, for example, unfortunate (and long standing) consequences for our understanding of cancer.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>\t\t\t<i>What Genes Can\xE2\x80\x99t Do</i> is at its best when Moss applies his keen understanding of cellular biology to the problem of understanding development and evolution from a perspective free from the metaphor of the gene as central controller, and indeed, free from the perspective that development must be under any sort of centralized control. This is not, of course, an original project. Many other biologists and philosophers have argued for such a re-articulation before, especially those researchers who identify with \xE2\x80\x9CDevelopmental Systems Theory.\xE2\x80\x9D But while Moss is firmly part of the DST project, his arguments seem to emerge from a different tradition than those of most of DST proponents. Unlike most of the usual arguments against the primacy of the gene, Moss\xE2\x80\x99s arguments are steeped in history and the messy details of cellular biology.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This approach is, at first, somewhat off-putting; one searches in vain for familiar arguments and references. For example, it seems unthinkable that a book about the failures of thinking in terms of centralized genetic control should, for example, never cite Lewontin, and that a history of the emergence of (various) gene concept(s) should never address e.g. Dobzhansky\xE2\x80\x99s work. After the shock wears off, however, much of Moss\xE2\x80\x99s work comes across as a refreshing change. Especially in Chapters 3 and 4 (\xE2\x80\x9CA Critique of Pure (Genetic) Information\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CDialectics of Disorder: Normalization and Pathology as Process\xE2\x80\x9D), Moss\xE2\x80\x99s arguments are as clear and compelling as any that have come before, and yet are unfamiliar enough to force one to rethink the old debates from the perspective he stakes out.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Moss suggests, with good justification, that work in both contemporary biology and contemporary philosophy of biology has been focused too much on genetics and not enough on the complex (and hence messy) intracellular environment. This misplaced focus, Moss suggests, has meant that most philosophers of biology, and indeed even many practicing biologists, are ignorant of even the basics of the internal structure of cells. Part of his goal in Chapter 3 is to remedy this ignorance, and the chapter does provide an excellent primer on \xE2\x80\x99wet\xE2\x80\x99 biology. I suspect most readers will find unfamiliar his particular presentation of, for example, SNARES, blebs, and the system of \xE2\x80\x9Cpancake\xE2\x80\x9D-shaped plasma membranes. Moss\xE2\x80\x99s account of the details of the intracellular environment makes for interesting reading, and for most people will serve as a reminder of just how little one knows (even of what little is known) about the internal working of cells. More importantly, Moss shows that even a basic understanding of the internal organization of the cell precludes thinking of DNA as a master-molecule, \xE2\x80\x99controlling\xE2\x80\x99 cellular development and organization. The internal cellular structure is <i>not</i> \xE2\x80\x99controlled\xE2\x80\x99 or \xE2\x80\x99coded\xE2\x80\x99 by DNA; the replication of the internal cellular structure is the result of straightforwardly (if massively complex) physical processes, and there is no place where the \xE2\x80\x99information\xE2\x80\x99 that the cellular structure \xE2\x80\x99represents\xE2\x80\x99 is \xE2\x80\x99stored.\xE2\x80\x99 While this was of course the main point of Oyama\xE2\x80\x99s groundbreaking <i>The Ontogeny of Information</i> (1985/2000), Moss lays out the growing body of evidence in favor of this position carefully, and the examples he chooses to develop are excellent.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>But even more significantly, Moss provides evidence that modifications to these complex structures are heritable through non-genetic pathways, and indeed may be implicated in speciation events (pp 96ff). Research focused on the evolutionary significance of \xE2\x80\x9Cepigenetic\xE2\x80\x9D mechanisms of inheritance is becoming increasingly common. However, as there has not yet been a substantive review of the emerging body of work in this field, it remains, for the most part, unfamiliar to people outside the particular fields. Further, work on variations that are heritable but do not primarily involve genetic variation is still somewhat outside the \xE2\x80\x99mainstream\xE2\x80\x99 of biological research and perhaps for that reason is not taken up with the same vigor as that found in straightforwardly molecular studies. Recent work in <i>Drosophila</i> on heritable variations in chromatin states and the phenotypic effects that can be exposed by reduced heat shock protein activity has received far less attention than the expression of <i>genetic</i> variation through reduced Hsp activity (see Sollars et al 2003, Pigliucci 2003). It is to Moss\xE2\x80\x99s credit that he confronts head-on the claim that genes are uniquely important because they are the only source of heritable phenotypic variation, and shows the claim to be wrong on straightforwardly empirical grounds. (Though here a more detailed analysis of the empirical work, and a more thorough review of previous work on this subject, would have been welcome.)</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The practical implications of non-genetic pathways of inheritance and the lack of any centralized control become obvious when Moss turns his attention to cancer research (Chapter 4). Moss presents the evidence that is generally taken to imply that cancer is a <i>genetic</i> disease \xE2\x80\x93 a disease that springs from some flaw <i>internal</i> to the cell where the cancer starts \xE2\x80\x93 and reveals that in fact the current evidence points in no such direction. Even if there are genetic changes that are associated with \xE2\x80\x99cancerous\xE2\x80\x99 cells, Moss argues that, in light of current evidence, many genetic changes will be better characterized as <i>effects</i> of the disruption of intercellular organization, not as causes of it (pp. 180). Moss reviews research showing that many of the field disruptions that may precede cancer result in the cells undergoing adaptive responses to intercellular environmental stresses. Cancer, in other words, may well not be the result of errors at the intracellular level spreading to the body, but rather the result of the failure of intercellular organization influencing individual cells (see esp. pp. 166ff). Through these examples from cancer research, Moss argues that new research should focus on the details of inter- and intracellular organization (an organization for which he argues we should use the metaphor of biological \xE2\x80\x9Cad-hoc committees,\xE2\x80\x9D pp. 188), rather than on the metaphor of a centralized genetic program \xE2\x80\x93 a shift in focus that he suggests would give us a more accurate view of the ways in which cancers develop.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>These are the strengths of <i>What Genes Can\xE2\x80\x99t Do</i>, and anyone interested in these subjects would do well to read it. There are, though, aspects of the book that are less compelling, or at least compelling to a much smaller group of readers than the material surveyed above. Chapter 1, \xE2\x80\x9CGenesis of the Gene,\xE2\x80\x9D is the longest chapter of the book, and, unless one shares Moss\xE2\x80\x99s fascination with the history of the gene concept, one is likely to find it slow-going. Moss actually needs to establish very little in this chapter in order to set the stage for the arguments in the rest of the book. As long as he can show that the metaphors of DNA as \xE2\x80\x9Cinformation,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cblueprints,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cinstructions,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Ccontrollers,\xE2\x80\x9D etc., imply a set of empirical claims that are not, and never were, particularly well-supported by research, Moss has given us all the introductory claims needed to underwrite the arguments in the book. But he does not stop here, and continues with an extended and, given the main focus of the book, overly complex discussion of the conceptual confusions that led to the influence these particular metaphors.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Moss suggests that genetic research has been shaped by the conflation of two very specific gene-concepts, which he terms \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CGene-D\xE2\x80\x9D. The \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D concept emerges (roughly) out of Mendel\xE2\x80\x99s elements, and \xE2\x80\x9Cgenes\xE2\x80\x9D in this sense are simply those things associated with statistically significant differences in phenotypic outcomes, whatever they may be and however they may work. In this sense, knowing what version of a \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D an organism has gives one some information about what the likely phenotypic outcome will be; knowing, for example, what combination of alleles associated with pea-color a pea-plant has permits one to predict what color the plant\xE2\x80\x99s peas will be (ceteris paribus). The \xE2\x80\x9CGene D\xE2\x80\x9D concept, on the other hand, refers to particular DNA nucleotide sequences that are used in organismal development. Here, the particular sequence is one of a number of resources that are necessary for development; while differences in the availability or type of this resource can \xE2\x80\x99make a difference\xE2\x80\x99 developmentally, so too can differences in many other available resources. Here, it makes no sense to speak of the gene as carrying \xE2\x80\x9Cinformation\xE2\x80\x9D about phenotypic organismal features. Moss suggests that the discovery that DNA was intimately involved with the formation of the myriad proteins involved in organismal development (and cellular function more generally) permitted the conflation of the two concepts; \xE2\x80\x9Cgenes\xE2\x80\x9D became both nucleotide sequences <i>and</i> predictors of phenotypic differences, though there is no one entity to which both concepts refer.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Despite the thoroughness of the first chapter, however, Moss\xE2\x80\x99s account of the history of these concepts, and of the generation of the confusion, is not wholly convincing. I agree that there is massive confusion in the literature between, e.g., \xE2\x80\x99genes\xE2\x80\x99 as something like markers associated with particular differences in phenotypes in particular environments and \xE2\x80\x99genes\xE2\x80\x99 as DNA sequences involved in development more generally (see, e.g., Kaplan & Pigliucci, 2000). And I\xE2\x80\x99m sympathetic to the \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D/\xE2\x80\x9DGene-D\xE2\x80\x9D distinction as one important element of the various gene-concept distinctions one might make. But I remain unconvinced that the \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D concept can be so neatly separated from the \xE2\x80\x9CGene-D\xE2\x80\x9D concept historically. For example, I tend to read Morgan\xE2\x80\x99s (and other early Drosophilists\xE2\x80\x99) claim to the effect that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe future of genetics [lies] in its connections with development and evolution\xE2\x80\x9D (from Kohler 1994, pp. 177) as implying that, despite the technical limitations of the day, those early researchers hoped that the \xE2\x80\x99genes\xE2\x80\x99 they were discovering would at least provide inroads to work in developmental and evolutionary biology. And later, the work with the period gene in Drosophila (Benzer, Hall, etc.) seems to me to have been wrapped up from its very early days in searches for biological meaning (and evolutionary significance) \xE2\x80\x93 not just for a gene-phenotype relationship that happened to hold in a particular population of fruit-flies in a particular laboratory environment (see Weiner 1999). If this is right, then \xE2\x80\x99gene for\xE2\x80\x99 talk has been, since it\xE2\x80\x99s earliest days, wrapped up in the functional and hence evolutionary significance of the genes in question. Done well, it is possible that this kind of \xE2\x80\x99gene for\xE2\x80\x99 talk is <i>neither</i> strictly \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D <i>nor</i> \xE2\x80\x9CGene-D\xE2\x80\x9D and yet avoids at least most of the pitfalls of conflation that Moss points towards (see Kaplan and Pigliucci 2000).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>There are, then, elements of the \xE2\x80\x99gene\xE2\x80\x99 concept that Moss\xE2\x80\x99s account misses, and historical turns that Moss doesn\xE2\x80\x99t address. Of course, as I have said, this isn\xE2\x80\x99t a problem for Moss\xE2\x80\x99s more general project in the balance of his book; indeed, it wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be a problem for the book at all if Moss hadn\xE2\x80\x99t given his historical account the significance attending a lengthy chapter on the subject.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>While the historical picture Moss presents in the first chapter seems to be too specific and detailed, the analysis in the second chapter, focusing on the rhetorical force of the metaphors surrounding contemporary genetics, seems simply out of place. To be sure, Moss\xE2\x80\x99s examination of Schr\xC3\xB6dinger\xE2\x80\x99s argument for the necessity of (at least something like) DNA to act as repository of information to guide development is well-presented. Moss argues that Schr\xC3\xB6dinger\xE2\x80\x99s reasons for thinking that biological stability needed to be grounded in an information-carrying \xE2\x80\x99crystal\xE2\x80\x99 were, while not exactly absurd, in fact, mistaken. There does not, in fact, have to be any one source for continued order, and, as it turns out, biological systems \xE2\x80\x99resist\xE2\x80\x99 entropy at many different levels and in many different ways. However, this very specific case is discussed without any of the nuanced historical context that would be of interest to, say, historians of biology, and for readers simply interested in alternatives to the \xE2\x80\x99standard\xE2\x80\x99 view of the gene as information, the discussion does little or no substantive work.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>As I noted earlier, most of Chapter 3 is an exploration of the ways in which aspects of biological order are replicated and maintained, and here Moss begins to hit his stride. The details of these processes clearly point away from the metaphor of \xE2\x80\x99information\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x93 there is no place where, for example, \xE2\x80\x99information\xE2\x80\x99 about which intracellular membranes go where is \xE2\x80\x99stored\xE2\x80\x99. Again, the biological details are fascinating and, I think, utterly convincing. But in addition, Moss appeals, unnecessarily, I think, to work by \xE2\x80\x99chaos\xE2\x80\x99 theorists on the creation and maintenance of stable complex cycles in non-linear systems. Here his use of Kauffman\xE2\x80\x99s work seems rather thin. In all fairness, Moss never claims that the approach Kauffman recommends is sound, nor that the results Kauffman (and others) have obtained are anything more than suggestive. Indeed, Moss criticizes Kauffman\xE2\x80\x99s assumptions as unrealistic, and Kauffman\xE2\x80\x99s vision of biology as too \xE2\x80\x99dry\xE2\x80\x99 and information-oriented (see pp 102-106). As with the discussion of Schr\xC3\xB6dinger, the <i>point</i> of going into some detail on the work of Kauffman (and other \xE2\x80\x99chaos\xE2\x80\x99 theorists) is rather mysterious. There isn\xE2\x80\x99t anything <i>wrong</i> with Moss\xE2\x80\x99s analysis, but again, it seems out of place in an otherwise fairly technical and non-speculative presentation.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>With respect to audience then, while the first chapter may not appeal to people for whom the History and Philosophy of Science means mostly philosophy, I have no doubt that historians of biology will find it worthy of careful attention; indeed, I suspect that historians will find the historical discussions that come up throughout <i>What Genes Can\xE2\x80\x99t Do</i> to be of special interest. Philosophers of biology, and most practicing biologists, should pay particular attention to the biological details and philosophical analysis offered in Chapters 3 and 4. Moss\xE2\x80\x99s analysis in these chapters points towards new directions for both empirical research and philosophical exploration, and shows that the continued resistance to these new directions is increasingly unmotivated.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

In this sense, knowing what version of a \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D an organism has gives one some information about what the likely phenotypic outcome will be; knowing, for example, what combination of alleles associated with pea-color a pea-plant has permits one to predict what color the plant\xE2\x80\x99s peas will be (ceteris paribus). The \xE2\x80\x9CGene D\xE2\x80\x9D concept, on the other hand, refers to particular DNA nucleotide sequences that are used in organismal development. Here, the particular sequence is one of a number of resources that are necessary for development; while differences in the availability or type of this resource can \xE2\x80\x99make a difference\xE2\x80\x99 developmentally, so too can differences in many other available resources. Here, it makes no sense to speak of the gene as carrying \xE2\x80\x9Cinformation\xE2\x80\x9D about phenotypic organismal features. Moss suggests that the discovery that DNA was intimately involved with the formation of the myriad proteins involved in organismal development (and cellular function more generally) permitted the conflation of the two concepts; \xE2\x80\x9Cgenes\xE2\x80\x9D became both nucleotide sequences <i>and</i> predictors of phenotypic differences, though there is no one entity to which both concepts refer.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Despite the thoroughness of the first chapter, however, Moss\xE2\x80\x99s account of the history of these concepts, and of the generation of the confusion, is not wholly convincing. I agree that there is massive confusion in the literature between, e.g., \xE2\x80\x99genes\xE2\x80\x99 as something like markers associated with particular differences in phenotypes in particular environments and \xE2\x80\x99genes\xE2\x80\x99 as DNA sequences involved in development more generally (see, e.g., Kaplan & Pigliucci, 2000). And I\xE2\x80\x99m sympathetic to the \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D/\xE2\x80\x9DGene-D\xE2\x80\x9D distinction as one important element of the various gene-concept distinctions one might make. But I remain unconvinced that the \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D concept can be so neatly separated from the \xE2\x80\x9CGene-D\xE2\x80\x9D concept historically. For example, I tend to read Morgan\xE2\x80\x99s (and other early Drosophilists\xE2\x80\x99) claim to the effect that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe future of genetics [lies] in its connections with development and evolution\xE2\x80\x9D (from Kohler 1994, pp. 177) as implying that, despite the technical limitations of the day, those early researchers hoped that the \xE2\x80\x99genes\xE2\x80\x99 they were discovering would at least provide inroads to work in developmental and evolutionary biology. And later, the work with the period gene in Drosophila (Benzer, Hall, etc.) seems to me to have been wrapped up from its very early days in searches for biological meaning (and evolutionary significance) \xE2\x80\x93 not just for a gene-phenotype relationship that happened to hold in a particular population of fruit-flies in a particular laboratory environment (see Weiner 1999). If this is right, then \xE2\x80\x99gene for\xE2\x80\x99 talk has been, since it\xE2\x80\x99s earliest days, wrapped up in the functional and hence evolutionary significance of the genes in question. Done well, it is possible that this kind of \xE2\x80\x99gene for\xE2\x80\x99 talk is <i>neither</i> strictly \xE2\x80\x9CGene-P\xE2\x80\x9D <i>nor</i> \xE2\x80\x9CGene-D\xE2\x80\x9D and yet avoids at least most of the pitfalls of conflation that Moss points towards (see Kaplan and Pigliucci 2000).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>There are, then, elements of the \xE2\x80\x99gene\xE2\x80\x99 concept that Moss\xE2\x80\x99s account misses, and historical turns that Moss doesn\xE2\x80\x99t address. Of course, as I have said, this isn\xE2\x80\x99t a problem for Moss\xE2\x80\x99s more general project in the balance of his book; indeed, it wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be a problem for the book at all if Moss hadn\xE2\x80\x99t given his historical account the significance attending a lengthy chapter on the subject.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>While the historical picture Moss presents in the first chapter seems to be too specific and detailed, the analysis in the second chapter, focusing on the rhetorical force of the metaphors surrounding contemporary genetics, seems simply out of place. To be sure, Moss\xE2\x80\x99s examination of Schr\xC3\xB6dinger\xE2\x80\x99s argument for the necessity of (at least something like) DNA to act as repository of information to guide development is well-presented. Moss argues that Schr\xC3\xB6dinger\xE2\x80\x99s reasons for thinking that biological stability needed to be grounded in an information-carrying \xE2\x80\x99crystal\xE2\x80\x99 were, while not exactly absurd, in fact, mistaken. There does not, in fact, have to be any one source for continued order, and, as it turns out, biological systems \xE2\x80\x99resist\xE2\x80\x99 entropy at many different levels and in many different ways. However, this very specific case is discussed without any of the nuanced historical context that would be of interest to, say, historians of biology, and for readers simply interested in alternatives to the \xE2\x80\x99standard\xE2\x80\x99 view of the gene as information, the discussion does little or no substantive work.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>As I noted earlier, most of Chapter 3 is an exploration of the ways in which aspects of biological order are replicated and maintained, and here Moss begins to hit his stride. The details of these processes clearly point away from the metaphor of \xE2\x80\x99information\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x93 there is no place where, for example, \xE2\x80\x99information\xE2\x80\x99 about which intracellular membranes go where is \xE2\x80\x99stored\xE2\x80\x99. Again, the biological details are fascinating and, I think, utterly convincing. But in addition, Moss appeals, unnecessarily, I think, to work by \xE2\x80\x99chaos\xE2\x80\x99 theorists on the creation and maintenance of stable complex cycles in non-linear systems. Here his use of Kauffman\xE2\x80\x99s work seems rather thin. In all fairness, Moss never claims that the approach Kauffman recommends is sound, nor that the results Kauffman (and others) have obtained are anything more than suggestive. Indeed, Moss criticizes Kauffman\xE2\x80\x99s assumptions as unrealistic, and Kauffman\xE2\x80\x99s vision of biology as too \xE2\x80\x99dry\xE2\x80\x99 and information-oriented (see pp 102-106). As with the discussion of Schr\xC3\xB6dinger, the <i>point</i> of going into some detail on the work of Kauffman (and other \xE2\x80\x99chaos\xE2\x80\x99 theorists) is rather mysterious. There isn\xE2\x80\x99t anything <i>wrong</i> with Moss\xE2\x80\x99s analysis, but again, it seems out of place in an otherwise fairly technical and non-speculative presentation.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>With respect to audience then, while the first chapter may not appeal to people for whom the History and Philosophy of Science means mostly philosophy, I have no doubt that historians of biology will find it worthy of careful attention; indeed, I suspect that historians will find the historical discussions that come up throughout <i>What Genes Can\xE2\x80\x99t Do</i> to be of special interest. Philosophers of biology, and most practicing biologists, should pay particular attention to the biological details and philosophical analysis offered in Chapters 3 and 4. Moss\xE2\x80\x99s analysis in these chapters points towards new directions for both empirical research and philosophical exploration, and shows that the continued resistance to these new directions is increasingly unmotivated.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
