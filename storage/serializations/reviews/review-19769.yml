content: "\xE2\x80\x80<p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">There are many ways of applying philosophy to language, and there are many ways of writing about this topic. Bernhard  Weiss is firmly rooted within the tradition of analytic philosophy, and this predisposes him to approach the topic along the lines of the analytic  pioneers; however, he is far from ensnared by tradition. He wants to report on  current trends and he wants to enter into conversation with their exponents.  Another crucial feature of his book is that Weiss does not want to concentrate  on a partial problem; his aim is to address language in its complexity <i style=\"\">as  a challenge for philosophy</i>. The result of blending these two ambitions is a compromise between an advanced introduction to the  philosophy of language and a discussion of those topics in analytic philosophy that he  takes to be the deepest -- mainly discussions within the intellectual space  opened up by the writings of Donald Davidson.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">The trouble with analytic philosophy of language is that it has amassed a huge heap of technical and semi-technical results  that are deep in their own way, but their direct <span class=\"GramE\">significance</span> is often far removed from the questions raised by a layman contemplating language. When I teach my introductory course on analytical philosophy  for philosophical <span class=\"GramE\">fresh(</span><span class=\"SpellE\">wo</span>)men, I  find it not so difficult to present the technical side of, say,  Russell's theory of definite descriptions or <span class=\"SpellE\">Tarski's</span>  theory of truth. To be sure, it requires some pedagogical experience to make these technicalities intelligible to beginners in philosophy; nevertheless,  the real trouble is to explain to them why they should see these things are  interesting and relevant for understanding language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">In this respect, Weiss's book cuts deeper than many other books on the general philosophy of language written in the  analytic tradition: his point of departure is devoted to considering language as a puzzle. How does language relate to the world and how is it related to  the mind? How does language work and how do words possess their meanings?  Such questions are posed from the position of an outsider, who is only  subsequently initiated into the labyrinth of methods and results of analytic  philosophy and shown that this approach may help us alleviate the original puzzlement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">In the first part of the book, Weiss offers a quick look at the traditional considerations that have forged the framework  for analytic philosophy of language: the basic <span class=\"SpellE\">Fregean</span> distinctions, the <span class=\"SpellE\">Russellian</span> analysis of  definite descriptions, the <span class=\"SpellE\">Kripkean</span> scruples about <span class=\"SpellE\">Russellian</span> descriptivism, and also the <span class=\"SpellE\">Austinian</span> and <span class=\"SpellE\">Gricean</span> speech acts theory and the <span class=\"SpellE\">Quinean</span> rejection of the analytic/synthetic  distinction. Weiss then moves to his main problem, around which he circles<b style=\"\"><i style=\"\"> </i></b>throughout the rest of the book: the (<span class=\"SpellE\">Quino</span>-<span class=\"GramE\">)<span class=\"SpellE\">Davidsonian</span></span> approach  to language from the perspective of the radical translator/interpreter. (It is a little bit  strange, given that radical interpretation is such a central topic for the book,  and given that this project is largely continuous with the <span class=\"SpellE\">Quinean</span> project of radical translation, that <span class=\"SpellE\">Quine</span>  is only an episodic figure in the plot of the book.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">The review of the <span class=\"SpellE\">Quinean</span> thought experiment with radical translation and the following discussion  of use-conditional vs. truth-conditional foundations of a theory of meaning  is still presented in a rather disengaged textbook style. (This is not a criticism, for I think that the pedagogical qualities that Weiss  displays in these non-controversial parts of the books are admirable.) But then it  is time for Davidson to appear on the scene and here Weiss's disengagement  slowly gives way to an engaged -- and no longer uncontroversial -- rethinking of the foundations of the <span class=\"SpellE\">Davidsonian</span> program.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Weiss starts with a reconstruction of Davidson's method of radical interpretation, from which he moves to a review of  Davidson's more enigmatic theory of interpretation, couched in terms of \"prior\" and \"passing\" theories, as presented especially in Davidson's \"Nice <span class=\"SpellE\">Derrangement</span> of <span class=\"SpellE\">Epithaphs</span>\". At  this point Weiss starts to present some interesting and bold theses.  The first of them is that Davidson's account of language and meaning is  essentially <i style=\"\">normative</i>, which appears to go against the grain of Davidson's own general aversion to taking <span class=\"SpellE\">normativity</span> as something essential for language. <span class=\"GramE\">At least at first sight.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Weiss tries to show that despite Davidson's own pronouncements, his approach could not work if there were no rules  underlying language. I concur. I think that Davidson's occasional hostility towards linguistic rules derives from the fact that what he understands when he  hears \"rules\" and \"<span class=\"SpellE\">normativity</span>\" is an idea Davidson (correctly or not) ascribes to <span class=\"SpellE\">Dummett</span>,  namely that language forces us to speak as others do. I agree that one can read  Davidson normatively, and Weiss does a wonderful job of working out the details  of this reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">The rest of the book is devoted to what seem to me  to be the most interesting contemporary discussions within philosophy of  language: the role of <span class=\"SpellE\">normativity</span> within the  foundations of language, the nature of the publicity of language, the relation of  language to social practices and the nature of the theory of meaning. Weiss tries to  show that Davidson's theory of meaning and interpretations as articulated in  terms of the prior and passing theories is not fully compatible with his  earlier notion of radical interpretation and writes:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span class=\"GramE\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">interpretations</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> are not just the constructs of radical interpreters and hearers; <i>speakers  </i>are guided in their use by interpretations. In being guided by a scheme of interpretation a speaker <i>intends </i>to uphold patterns of use: those patterns that would ground the interpretative scheme. Because these  patterns of use are objects of the speaker's intentions they are not <i>mere </i>regularities, but  regularities to which she intends to accord, regularities to which she  is bound by her linguistic intentions. Her use is thus subject to  standards, in the absence of which it is mere babbling. So the argument is very  simple. It depends on the radical interpreter to make plain the primacy of  regularities of use and then uses the fact that interpreters (or hearers) are speakers  too in order to show that these patterns of use acquire normative significance.  (p. 132)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Weiss takes issue with those who have recently  argued vigorously that meaning is not normative in any nontrivial sense of the  word (<span class=\"SpellE\">Boghossian</span>, <span class=\"SpellE\">Hattiangadi</span>),  that any \"ought\" contained in our semantic talk is at most instrumental and hence dispensable. I am happy to join him in his campaign against  the anti-<span class=\"SpellE\">normativists</span>, but I would prefer to  use different weapons. Weiss grants the anti-<span class=\"SpellE\">normativists</span> that it  is unwarranted to assume that if a speaker S means that F by the sentence  s, then she ought to assert s only if F; his proposal is that while this  assumption is unwarranted, we may safely assume that if S means that F by s, then she  ought to assert S only if s intends to assert that F. I would not grant this.  It seems to me that the rules of language do make us assert what is true,  not because of any norm over and above the rules of language, but because  truth is nothing else than correct <span class=\"SpellE\">assertability</span>  (where this is, to be sure, one kind of correctness among others that we can think  of in relation to language). Hence it seems to me that just as a chess player  who takes a piece to be a bishop <i style=\"\">ought to</i> move it only diagonally (otherwise it would be an <i style=\"\">error </i>--  independently of any intention the player may or may not have), a language speaker <i style=\"\">ought to</i> use sentences according to the rules of language. I think that to assert  \"It is raining\" on a cloudless day is simply incorrect (incorrect, that is,  in the sense of correctness that amounts to truth; it might be  simultaneously correct in some other sense). This does not in any way contradict the  fact that we may intend to assert it despite this incorrectness, perhaps by way of  irony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Weiss considers <span class=\"SpellE\">Dummett's</span> criticism of the <span class=\"SpellE\">Davidsonian</span> project of  radical interpretation, and portrays the difference between the two philosophers  as the difference between aiming at a \"radical\" versus a \"robust\" theory of meaning. It is only later that it becomes clear how deep  Weiss's doubts about the entire <span class=\"SpellE\">Davidsonian</span> project  of radical interpretation are, but already here he presents some arguments <i style=\"\">pro</i> <span class=\"SpellE\">Dummett</span> and <i style=\"\">contra</i> Davidson. Perhaps the most telling point is the one related to the joke where a person is asked  whether she can speak Spanish and answers \"I do not know, I haven't tried\". Weiss then claims:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span class=\"SpellE\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Dummett</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\"> diagnoses the <span class=\"SpellE\">humor</span> as stemming from an  absurdity. In some cases there is obviously no absurdity in a similar remark: just  imagine that the character had been asked whether or not she can swim or ride a bicycle. In cases such as these one can have a clear conception of the  capacity in question in advance of possessing it but in the linguistic case it  makes no sense to suppose that the character can conceive of what it is to speak  Spanish in advance of speaking it. (p. 169)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">This is surely a deep observation: Weiss interprets  it as showing that knowledge of a language, though it may be thought of as a  kind <span class=\"GramE\">of</span> <i style=\"\">know how</i>, differs importantly from such skills as knowing how to swim. I would add  that it is precisely this overhasty assimilation of language to the more  practical skills that feeds the theory Davidson develops in his \"Nice <span class=\"SpellE\">Derrangement</span> of <span class=\"SpellE\">Epithaphs</span>\".<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Now it becomes explicit that Weiss has serious  doubts about the very concept of radical interpretation: he sees the project as  based on the idea that whereas it is true that we must have learned language  from scratch, it does not follow that there must be a way of describing its  usage in some 'neutral' terms, uncontaminated by the concepts we possess thanks  to our mastering language -- i.e., in terms that would be, as it were, 'the  world's own', not ours. But this, Weiss urges, is a hopeless project. Thus,  instead of a <i style=\"\">radical</i> interpretation, Weiss argues for a similar, but different project that he calls <i style=\"\">robust</i>  interpretation and that takes seriously <span class=\"SpellE\">Dummett's</span> criticism of Davidson.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">When Weiss puts all his cards on the table, his  account of the relationship between language and the world, underlying the understanding of language to which he converges<b style=\"\"><i style=\"\"> </i></b>throughout  the book, is a view he calls \"modest realism\" that is condensed into the following four points (p. 217):<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">(<span class=\"SpellE\">i</span>) <span class=\"GramE\">realism</span> is  constituted not by a relation of the practice to something external to it but by its own  internal richness, for instance, the necessity of an appropriate policing  practice for any apparently rule-governed practice;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">(ii) <span class=\"GramE\">the</span> world we describe is conditioned by our means  of describing it;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">(iii) <span class=\"GramE\">the</span> position is established by showing that it is  the only position that coheres with our self-conception -- here as beings capable  of binding their use to a norm;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">(iv) <span class=\"GramE\">although</span> we cannot make sense of the idea in full  detail given the contingency we discover at the base of our practice, we must  admit the possibility of alternative practices, alternatives based in  different forms of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">This clarifies Weiss own position <i style=\"\">vis-\xC3\xA0-vis</i>  not only those of Davidson and <span class=\"SpellE\">Dummett</span>, but also other contemporary thinkers of a similar provenance, e.g.,  McDowell or <span class=\"SpellE\">Brandom</span>. It seems to me that out of them, <span class=\"SpellE\">Brandom</span> is Weiss's most natural ally, although he  obviously does not want to be anybody's blind follower, thinking things through in  his own way without paying excessive attention to the authorities. To follow  him on his path through the labyrinth of language is not only very  enlightening; it is also a great enjoyment.</span>"

It seems to me that out of them, <span class=\"SpellE\">Brandom</span> is Weiss's most natural ally, although he  obviously does not want to be anybody's blind follower, thinking things through in  his own way without paying excessive attention to the authorities. To follow  him on his path through the labyrinth of language is not only very  enlightening; it is also a great enjoyment.</span>"
