content: "<p>This volume collects under a single cover eleven post-war essays by German philosophers on Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s social and political philosophy. With the exception of the contribution of Friedrich Fulda, which is a much-shortened version of his 1963 monograph, each of the essays has been previously published. Nicolas Walker has produced the translations for this volume.</p>  \n\
  <p>The collection is published as part of the Cambridge University Press series \xE2\x80\x9CThe German Philosophical Tradition.\xE2\x80\x9D A blurb on the front piece announces that the aim of the series is to make available to the Anglo-American philosophical community \xE2\x80\x9Cimportant recent work by German philosophers on major figures in the German philosophical tradition.\xE2\x80\x9D The editors have selected essays of top quality, some of which have had considerable impact on Hegel studies in Germany. They are, in general, quite technical \xE2\x80\x93 not suitable either for a general audience or for beginners in the subject. Some of the papers (by Fulda and Henrich, for instance) are pretty dense and heavy (dare I say \xE2\x80\x9CGermanic\xE2\x80\x9D?). But even those that try the reader\xE2\x80\x99s patience are well worth careful study. I admit to being daunted by the task of trying to convey in so few words the interest of each of these essays. All I can do here is indicate something of their content and occasionally draw attention to strengths and weaknesses.</p>  \n\
  <p>Following the informative introduction to the volume by Pippin, the editors have included two \xE2\x80\x9Coverview\xE2\x80\x9D papers. Both explore Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s puzzling claim, expressed in the Preface to the <i>Philosophy of Right</i>, that \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is actual is rational, and what is rational is actual.\xE2\x80\x9D As Hans Friedrich Fulda puts it in his piece \xE2\x80\x9CThe Rights of Philosophy,\xE2\x80\x9D if philosophy on Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s account \xE2\x80\x9Ccannot transcend the substantial content of its time,\xE2\x80\x9D how can it ground versus merely reflect the norms that happen to be actual (37)? Fulda rightly tells us that philosophy, for Hegel, is not content to \xE2\x80\x9Cleave the state of the world to itself\xE2\x80\x9D (41). But Fulda gives us little help in understanding why Hegel considers himself justified in awarding a critical function to philosophical reflection. It does not clarify much to claim, as Fulda does, that even though Hegel is committed to the view that philosophy \xE2\x80\x9Ccannot transcend the substantial content of its own time,\xE2\x80\x9D it nonetheless \xE2\x80\x9Cstands above time in point of form\xE2\x80\x9D because it can \xE2\x80\x9Crepresent the thought of this content\xE2\x80\x9D (37). We need to know why the capacity to \xE2\x80\x9Crepresent the thought\xE2\x80\x9D of some content counts as genuinely critical.</p>  \n\
  <p>Karl-Otto Apel\xE2\x80\x99s piece, \xE2\x80\x9CKant, Hegel, and the Contemporary Question Concerning the Normative Foundations of Morality and Right,\xE2\x80\x9D lobbies for his own pragmatic \xE2\x80\x9Ctransformation\xE2\x80\x9D of transcendental philosophy, his effort to combine the best insights of Kant and Hegel (49). This essay, like Fulda\xE2\x80\x99s, is quite ambitious in scope. Apel first gives us an overview of his understanding of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s (entire) critique of Kant, and then moves on to provide a sweeping survey of his own program. For those interested in the motivations behind his effort to mediate between Kant and Hegel, this paper provides a good introduction. I had worries about Apel\xE2\x80\x99s reading of Hegel, however. On page 72, he seems to attribute to Hegel the view that the identity of the rational and the actual is an ideal posited in advance by reason (by Hegel?), an ideal we are waiting for history to realize. It seems to me more accurate to say that, for Hegel, at <i>any</i> age in history, a moment of the rational is already reflected in the actual. (For a more reliable discussion of this topic, see Ritter\xE2\x80\x99s contribution.)</p>  \n\
  <p>The remaining papers provide somewhat more focused discussions of particular aspects of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s social and political philosophy. In \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99The Personality of the Will\xE2\x80\x99 as the Principle of Abstract Right: An Analysis of \xC2\xA7\xC2\xA7 34-40 of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Philosophy of Right</i> in Terms of the Logical Structure of the Concept,\xE2\x80\x9D Michael Quante explains the sense in which Personality, for Hegel, is the most abstract of the three moments of the will. He helps us understand not just what Hegel takes to be deficient about this stage of the will, but also what motivates the progression beyond Personality in the <i>Philosophy of Right</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>In \xE2\x80\x9CPerson and Property in Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Philosophy of Right</i> (\xC2\xA7\xC2\xA734-81),\xE2\x80\x9D Joachim Ritter explores Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s argument, also in the Abstract Right section of the <i>Philosophy of Right</i>, that human freedom is actualized in the person\xE2\x80\x99s right to things, the right to property. In addition to holding that freedom requires our objectification of nature, Ritter points out, Hegel also anticipates some of Marx\xE2\x80\x99s concerns about the negative impact of that objectification (111). This essay both demystifies Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s argument for the right to property and contains some of the best discussion in the collection of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s account of the standpoint of philosophical reflection in relation to the realm of the actual.</p>  \n\
  <p>Manfred Baum directs our attention to the third and final section of the <i>Philosophy of Right</i>, the section \xE2\x80\x9CEthical Life.\xE2\x80\x9D His discussion, in \xE2\x80\x9CCommon Welfare and Universal Will in Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Philosophy of Right,</i>\xE2\x80\x9D is especially helpful in illuminating Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s portrayal of the nature of civil society. On Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s characterization, one promotes the purposes of society as a whole, in civil society, as a means of promoting one\xE2\x80\x99s own purposes (135). Civil society is thus not ethical substance; it is not yet the state. Baum\xE2\x80\x99s essay turns from exegesis to criticism when he raises doubts about Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s suggestion that both Rousseau and Kant fail to clearly enough distinguish civil society and the state.</p>  \n\
  <p>One of the finest examples of philosophical argumentation in the volume is Wolfgang Schild\xE2\x80\x99s essay, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Contemporary Relevance of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s Concept of Punishment.\xE2\x80\x9D The scope of Schild\xE2\x80\x99s objective in this piece is more limited than that of many of the other authors in the volume; perhaps this in part explains why his effort is so effective. He offers us a measured defense of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s theory of punishment. At the basis of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s theory of punishment, Schild argues, is the idea of freedom. In committing crime, the criminal fails to recognize her victim as a person (as a free subjectivity and thus a bearer of right). But given that the criminal who acts is also a free subjectivity, crime is in effect a violation of the criminal\xE2\x80\x99s own will (159). Punishment is thus justified, according to Hegel, as a means of honoring the free and rational aspect of the criminal. Punishment re-asserts the very right that the criminal tries to destroy (164).</p>  \n\
  <p>In one of the two essays most directly critical of Hegel (Siep\xE2\x80\x99s being the other), Siegfried Blasche argues that Hegel is not sufficiently sensitive to the contingent historical assumptions that inform his own understanding of the domains of the family, civil society and the state. In his compelling paper \xE2\x80\x9CNatural Ethical Life and Civil Society: Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s Construction of the Family,\xE2\x80\x9D Blasche claims that Hegel oversimplifies matters in telling us that, within the state, the family develops into (and is thus historically prior to) civil society. Rather, the family Hegel describes in Ethical Life does not exist in the absence of modern civil society as a precondition. The family can only fulfill the natural ethical function Hegel awards it once civil society is in place, once the business of satisfying needs is relegated to the system of needs (in civil society). Even Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s portrayal of the modern subjectivity presupposes civil society at its basis, according to Blasche. Only the subject who is free of the responsibilities of traditional family life is in a position to pursue his own interests and determine his own will (194). A historically contingent conception of civil society thus serves to ground Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s account of the family and of modern subjectivity.</p>  \n\
  <p>In \xE2\x80\x9CThe Role of Civil Society in Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s Political Philosophy,\xE2\x80\x9D Rolf-Peter Horstmann gives us an account of the development of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s political theory, beginning with the 1802 essay on natural law. In his paper we encounter once again the problem of sorting out Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Creactionary\xE2\x80\x9D versus \xE2\x80\x9Cprogressive\xE2\x80\x9D tendencies. Horstmann provides a nuanced and measured discussion of this problem; he does not try to suggest that there is a simple solution to it. This paper is interesting to compare with that of Blasche since, in contrast to Blasche, Horstmann emphasizes Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s arguments for the primacy of the state over all other forms of ethical life.</p>  \n\
  <p>Like Horstmann, Ludwig Siep is worried about non-liberal and non-democratic elements in Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s political philosophy. In \xE2\x80\x9CConstitution, Fundamental Rights, and Social Welfare in Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Philosophy of Right,</i>\xE2\x80\x9D Siep highlights two grounds for concern. He is concerned, first, about Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s denial that there can ever be any truly independent check, any set of norms outside the state, with which we can assess its legitimacy. He is concerned, second, about the fact that the historical process that is supposed to determine which actual norms get codified in the form of a constitution is, for Hegel, a process in which not all are allowed a voice. Siep reminds us, for example, that Hegel rejects the idea of a legislative assembly based on elections. (269). Siep\xE2\x80\x99s conclusion is that Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s system lacks the resources to sufficiently protect the rights of individuals from abuses of the state (287). (Here I cannot resist suggesting that the reader compare Siep\xE2\x80\x99s perspective with that of the American Hegelian, George Armstrong Kelly, in his 1976 <i>Polity</i> paper, \xE2\x80\x9CPolitics and Philosophy in Hegel.\xE2\x80\x9D)</p>  \n\
  <p>The final section of the collection contains two of its richest contributions. Both explore what might be referred to as the logic of the <i>Philosophy of Right</i>. How are we to think about the relations holding among the various stages or moments in Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s account of the development of right? As Dieter Henrich argues in his now classic paper \xE2\x80\x9CLogical Form and Real Totality: The Authentic Conceptual Form of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s Concept of the State,\xE2\x80\x9D Hegel does not intend us to understand the progression from stage to stage in straightforwardly causal terms. We thus err, for example, if we think of the state, on Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s conception, as the mere effect of some agreement or contract among members of civil society. If the state is said to emerge somehow from civil society, it does so, Henrich argues, as a \xE2\x80\x9Cformal implication\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Csyllogistic conclusion\xE2\x80\x9D (246). The state, for Hegel, is the ground without which the needs and free activity of humans in civil society cannot be sustained. In Henrich\xE2\x80\x99s words, the modes of civil society \xE2\x80\x9Ccan emerge properly only within the systematic political body in its actuality as a whole\xE2\x80\x9D (248). Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of the state occurs in the final pages of the text, but the state has priority in so far as it sustains abstract right, morality, the family and civil society.</p>  \n\
  <p>Henrich has little patience for those who discover in Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s political system the view that individual freedom gets sacrificed in the service of the whole (263). What a proper understanding of the logical structure of the text reveals, according to Henrich, is that the whole both sustains <i>and must be sustained by</i> its parts. Hegel holds that the state \xE2\x80\x9Crests on the self-consciousness of subjectivity.\xE2\x80\x9D He wishes us to accept an implication of this assumption, namely, that the state\xE2\x80\x99s institutions must \xE2\x80\x9Cbe sustained and activated by that subjectivity\xE2\x80\x9D (264).</p>  \n\
  <p>In his fascinating paper, \xE2\x80\x9CHegel\xE2\x80\x99s Organicist Theory of the State: On the Concept and Method of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x99Science of the State\xE2\x80\x99,\xE2\x80\x9D Michael Wolff explores Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s claim that the state is an \xE2\x80\x9Corganic totality.\xE2\x80\x9D The idea of organic totality implies a particular logic of part/whole (particular/universal) relations. Wolff explains the logic of organic unity in this way: For Hegel, he writes, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe state could properly be regarded as an organism only to the extent that it is a whole articulated in its parts, one where the whole and parts causally determine one another with respect to their form and interconnection\xE2\x80\x9D (317f). The earlier stages of right, for Hegel, also may be understood in terms of the logic of their particular part/whole relations. Building on a thesis he attributes to Henrich, Wolff relies on Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s doctrine of syllogistic forms to make explicit the logic of the various phases of right in the <i>Philosophy of Right</i>. If we take into account the different logical relations that can obtain between the terms universal, particular, singular (i.e., the different syllogistic forms), we can explain the progressions in the text from one stage of right to the next. The state is an organic totality in that it is only in the state that the relation between particular and universal is that of reciprocal determination. (As Wolff points out, Hegel relies for his notion of organic totality on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s discussion in the <i>Critique of Judgment</i> (esp. \xC2\xA7\xC2\xA7 77-79).) This is an extraordinarily impressive paper. Both this essay and Henrich\xE2\x80\x99s are essential reading, especially for those convinced that Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s political theory can be comfortably dissociated from his logic.</p>"

What a proper understanding of the logical structure of the text reveals, according to Henrich, is that the whole both sustains <i>and must be sustained by</i> its parts. Hegel holds that the state \xE2\x80\x9Crests on the self-consciousness of subjectivity.\xE2\x80\x9D He wishes us to accept an implication of this assumption, namely, that the state\xE2\x80\x99s institutions must \xE2\x80\x9Cbe sustained and activated by that subjectivity\xE2\x80\x9D (264).</p>  \n\
  <p>In his fascinating paper, \xE2\x80\x9CHegel\xE2\x80\x99s Organicist Theory of the State: On the Concept and Method of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x99Science of the State\xE2\x80\x99,\xE2\x80\x9D Michael Wolff explores Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s claim that the state is an \xE2\x80\x9Corganic totality.\xE2\x80\x9D The idea of organic totality implies a particular logic of part/whole (particular/universal) relations. Wolff explains the logic of organic unity in this way: For Hegel, he writes, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe state could properly be regarded as an organism only to the extent that it is a whole articulated in its parts, one where the whole and parts causally determine one another with respect to their form and interconnection\xE2\x80\x9D (317f). The earlier stages of right, for Hegel, also may be understood in terms of the logic of their particular part/whole relations. Building on a thesis he attributes to Henrich, Wolff relies on Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s doctrine of syllogistic forms to make explicit the logic of the various phases of right in the <i>Philosophy of Right</i>. If we take into account the different logical relations that can obtain between the terms universal, particular, singular (i.e., the different syllogistic forms), we can explain the progressions in the text from one stage of right to the next. The state is an organic totality in that it is only in the state that the relation between particular and universal is that of reciprocal determination. (As Wolff points out, Hegel relies for his notion of organic totality on Kant\xE2\x80\x99s discussion in the <i>Critique of Judgment</i> (esp. \xC2\xA7\xC2\xA7 77-79).) This is an extraordinarily impressive paper. Both this essay and Henrich\xE2\x80\x99s are essential reading, especially for those convinced that Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s political theory can be comfortably dissociated from his logic.</p>"
