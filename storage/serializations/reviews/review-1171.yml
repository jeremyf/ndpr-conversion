content: "<p>The book is another item in the recent expanding literature taking up metaphysical issues in the \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic tradition.\xE2\x80\x9D It comes recommended by blurbs on the jacket written by significant figures in the revival of metaphysics. Thus it is surprising and disappointing to find a carelessness and ineptness of argument and critical analysis as well as a succession of trivial verbal solutions to serious problems.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The author announces he is adhering to a \xE2\x80\x9Cminimalist\xE2\x80\x9D view of propositions according to which they are different from sentences since they are what is stated or expressed but are not abstract entities that exist in a Platonic realm (p. 9). This means, \xE2\x80\x9Cthey are only instantiated when thought by someone.\xE2\x80\x9D (How else would they be \xE2\x80\x9Cinstantiated\xE2\x80\x9D one wonders.) G. Bergmann held such a view, carefully articulated and defended, rather than casually expressed, from the 1950s, and it turns out that author\xE2\x80\x99s view is simply a version of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s 1913 analysis. What the author really wants to do is claim, as Bergmann explicitly did and as Russell did in his way, that propositions are dependent on their \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing instantiated\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cthought by\xE2\x80\x9D someone, though, as he states matters, he seems to simply say that for a proposition to be instantiated is for it to be thought by someone\xE2\x80\x94thus explaining his use of \xE2\x80\x9Cinstantiates.\xE2\x80\x9D Why are propositions then not \xE2\x80\x9Cabstract\xE2\x80\x9D? It will turn out they are, since they are \xE2\x80\x9Cinstantiated\xE2\x80\x9D. So we have a variant of the theme that only instantiated universals exist.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Criticizing Quine\xE2\x80\x99s problematic criterion of ontological commitment, the author ignores the two-fold aspect involved: a criterion for determining the commitments of a schema (language) and the determination of \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat there is\xE2\x80\x9D via employing such a criterion for a schema that fulfills certain criteria\xE2\x80\x94being a \xE2\x80\x9Cminimal\xE2\x80\x9D schema that accommodates the statements of empirical science and mathematics, for example. Thus it is hardly fair, and far too simple, to speak of determining what there is in terms of features of language. It ignores the whole point of the \xE2\x80\x9Clinguistic turn\xE2\x80\x9D in philosophy that took clarifications to be aided by the use of clarified linguistic schema that could fulfill very definite purposes. Thus, in logic, for example, without dealing with certain kinds of \xE2\x80\x9Cformalized\xE2\x80\x9D schemata, one could not precisely define \xE2\x80\x9Cfollows from\xE2\x80\x9D (derived from) and investigate properties of that relation nor precisely specify rules of derivation or proof\xE2\x80\x94nor could one be precise about notions like \xE2\x80\x9Ctrue in a model.\xE2\x80\x9D The author\xE2\x80\x99s fusing of Quine\xE2\x80\x99s two-fold views about \xE2\x80\x9Contology\xE2\x80\x9D comes out clearly in two consecutive sentences: \xE2\x80\x9CFor Quine . . . we reveal which things we take to be objects . . . by quantifying over them. Others regard as real what our best scientific theories assume to exist.\xE2\x80\x9D (47) These are hardly alternatives, and Quine, in his way, held to both.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Chapter 3 is typical of the book. It spends the first 13 pages on an elementary discussion of Russell, Wittgenstein and atomic facts, rehearsing various questions that have arisen over the years, but dodging, though touching upon, the critical questions raised by \xE2\x80\x9Cpossibilities\xE2\x80\x9D and false atomic sentences for a correspondence account of truth. As history it is skimpy\xE2\x80\x94as analysis it is empty. At best it calls attention to some issues about nominalistic versus realistic interpretations of the <i>Tractatus</i>\xE2\x80\x94questions about the meaning of \xE2\x80\x9Cstates of affairs,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cpossibilities\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cfacts\xE2\x80\x9D (one could have added \xE2\x80\x9Cpossible states of affairs\xE2\x80\x9D) without really probing into anything. The next five pages introduce a symbolic apparatus to make the simple point, made by a Russell in one sentence (which the author footnotes), that the sentence \xE2\x80\x9CaRb,\xE2\x80\x9D having three terms (on a standard reading) in a juxtaposition \xE2\x80\x9Crelation,\xE2\x80\x9D is of a different form than the purported corresponding fact having two terms standing in the relation R. (But then there is Sellars\xE2\x80\x99 reading, which is neither raised nor discussed, that purports to offer a way around the obvious objection\xE2\x80\x94which Russell, but not the author, also noted and discussed.) The book slides by the interesting issues of logical form and order in facts with brief footnotes mentioning Russell\xE2\x80\x99s taking them up in the 1913 <i>Theory of Knowledge</i> manuscript.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In a section entitled \xE2\x80\x9CCorrespondence without Facts\xE2\x80\x9D the author sets out, and appears to endorse, the view that it suffices to hold that a predicative sentence is true if and only if \xE2\x80\x9CThe particulars referred to by the proper names in the sentence actually instantiate the universal referred to by the predicate in the sentence\xE2\x80\x9D (76) and the order \xE2\x80\x9Cof the proper names in the sentence reflects the order of the particulars under the universal.\xE2\x80\x9D This, of course, raises the obvious issues about \xE2\x80\x9Cactually instantiate\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cunder the universal,\xE2\x80\x9D as well as the less obvious one involving an account of the \xE2\x80\x9Corder of the particulars.\xE2\x80\x9D Obvious but, when all is said and done, simply dismissed. More about this below.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Chapter IV deals with Russell\xE2\x80\x99s theory of truth and views on acquaintance. It is misleadingly stated, \xE2\x80\x9CThe notion of acquaintance is such that the objects of acquaintance are limited to things like sense data.\xE2\x80\x9D (90) No way\xE2\x80\x94universal relations, logical forms (whether they are \xE2\x80\x9Centities\xE2\x80\x9D or not), universal properties, common qualities (as constituents of bundles of qualities, rather than \xE2\x80\x9Cadjectives\xE2\x80\x9D of particulars), even mental acts in the years prior to 1919, are also typically \xE2\x80\x9Cobjects\xE2\x80\x9D of acquaintance (possibly even selves in 1912, if one recalls the discussion of Bismarck). The author proceeds to hold that, for Russell, a belief \xE2\x80\x9Cappears to be an act of a person\xE2\x80\x9D and that Russell says that he uses the terms \xE2\x80\x9Cbelief\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cjudgment\xE2\x80\x9D as synonyms, but \xE2\x80\x9Cboth terms are ambiguous\xE2\x80\x9D in that each can \xE2\x80\x9Cmean either the <i>act</i> of a person or the <i>content</i> of that act.\xE2\x80\x9D Again\xE2\x80\x94not right. For Russell, the terms indicate universal relations, on the multiple-relation theory (whether the same relation or not is immaterial\xE2\x80\x94though \xE2\x80\x9Cunderstanding\xE2\x80\x9D was sometimes used as the generic term, \xE2\x80\x9Cjudgment\xE2\x80\x9D as a determinate form of an \xE2\x80\x9Cunderstanding\xE2\x80\x9D relation). The \xE2\x80\x9Ccontent\xE2\x80\x9D is what is taken as the proposition in the 1913 manuscript and a \xE2\x80\x9Cperson\xE2\x80\x9D plays the role of the traditional act in that manuscript. Though there are numerous statements by Russell that propositions do not exist, the matter is complicated. Russell\xE2\x80\x99s propositions are neither Fregean senses of sentences nor Moore\xE2\x80\x99s content properties, but \xE2\x80\x9Cforms,\xE2\x80\x9D albeit not logical forms, of particular understanding facts. (Being forms, they do not occur as constituent terms in the analysis of belief facts such as\xE2\x80\x94Believes(Othello, loves, a, b).) Such forms are not logical forms since they can \xE2\x80\x9Ccontain\xE2\x80\x9D non-logical \xE2\x80\x9Cconstants,\xE2\x80\x9D as in what is indicated by \xE2\x80\x9CU(S, loves, a, b)\xE2\x80\x9D with \xE2\x80\x9CU\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CS\xE2\x80\x9D as variables ranging over \xE2\x80\x9Cintentional\xE2\x80\x9D relations and persons, respectively. It expresses the content (proposition) that a loves b. (Though Russell uses expressions with free variables, he reads them as existential quantifications.)</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The multiple-relation theory marks not only the attempt to dispense with Fregean style propositions but is probably the beginning of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s dispensing with Moore\xE2\x80\x99s (Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s) mental acts, which he does in published form in 1921 in <i>The Analysis of Mind</i>, after disposing of the self in 1919 (in 1918 in unpublished papers). Eventually all basic standard particulars will be dispensed with in 1940\xE2\x80\x94the term \xE2\x80\x9Cstandard\xE2\x80\x9D is to note that in 1940 he will call common qualities of objects (construed as bundles of qualities) \xE2\x80\x9Cparticulars.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>For Newman, as it turns out, (122 ff) propositions are \xE2\x80\x9Creal units\xE2\x80\x9D since they can be thought <i>about</i> as well as simply \xE2\x80\x9Cthought.\xE2\x80\x9D They are things that \xE2\x80\x9Coccur in belief contexts\xE2\x80\x9D and can be abstracted from such contexts (123) and in that sense are \xE2\x80\x9Cabstract.\xE2\x80\x9D Thus the author repeats, in different words, Russell\xE2\x80\x99s 1913 view taking propositions as forms (but not logical forms) of belief, etc. facts\xE2\x80\x94since he, like Bergmann, takes them as instantiated \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversals.\xE2\x80\x9D Facts, it turns out, are not units.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The discussion of the multiple-relation theory is guided by various recent secondary sources and not a result of a careful examination of the original texts. It cites three \xE2\x80\x9Cmost serious\xE2\x80\x9D criticisms as problems. Two are not problems at all, on a proper understanding of the theory, and the third is basically Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s well known criticism that Russell discussed in the 1918 logical atomism lectures\xE2\x80\x94the problem of a relation functioning as both a term, in a belief fact, and as a \xE2\x80\x9Crelating\xE2\x80\x9D relation to help \xE2\x80\x9Cunify\xE2\x80\x9D the content. The author doesn\xE2\x80\x99t grasp the implication of saying that a type distinction between particulars and relations excludes \xE2\x80\x9Cgrosser impossibilities\xE2\x80\x9D (135)\xE2\x80\x94and thus that only certain nonsensical combinations are \xE2\x80\x9Cpossible.\xE2\x80\x9D For then one might as well say that the terms and their ordering have to be such as to form a meaningful sentence\xE2\x80\x94thus giving up the theory\xE2\x80\x94which is Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s point, and led to Russell\xE2\x80\x99s 1918 discussion. What the author also misses is the serious problem raised by Russell\xE2\x80\x99s transforming the multiple-relation theory, in cases with relational contents, into one employing a dyadic relation holding between a person and a purported existential fact (or a purported fact denoted by a definite description). For such facts do not exist when the belief (judgment) is false.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The book proposes to advance a realist account of universals (and particulars) but to avoid facts in setting out a correspondence theory of truth. So one is intrigued as to how it will be done. The answer comes as a ripple in the wave of current talk about ontological free lunches, supervenience, non-additions to being, fusions that are no more than what is fused, etc. etc. Here it is even simpler\xE2\x80\x94minimalist one might say. Consider a red object. There is the particular object, A, and the property red. But there is no need for the fact that the object is red to ground the truth that A is red. No, all we need note is that the property is a \xE2\x80\x9Cway\xE2\x80\x9D the object is. That takes care of facts and all the problems about predication\xE2\x80\x94end of story. The move is familiar from attempts to deal with the Frege-Bradley regress by taking <i>exemplification</i> to be dependent on A and red, and hence not really a relation giving rise to a further relational state of affairs. Thus the fact of A\xE2\x80\x99s being red will purportedly do. Here it goes one step further. All we need are A and red, since red is a way A is. That is all there is to it and is why the reader is treated to many words about the need for instantiation. (Actually, the specific move is also familiar from variants of trope theories\xE2\x80\x94where a specific red trope (or a specific \xE2\x80\x9Cinstantiated\xE2\x80\x9D relational trope) is \xE2\x80\x9Cinternally\xE2\x80\x9D tied or related\xE2\x80\x94hence there is not \xE2\x80\x9Creally\xE2\x80\x9D a connection or relation\xE2\x80\x94 to the particular red object (pair of related objects) it is the quality of (relates).) Thus there is no need to talk of any instantiation relation or compositional connection\xE2\x80\x94depending on the kind of trope theory. One can imagine Ryle pointing out the way to a pub if asked if it were indeed a fact that there was a pub nearby, thus pointedly indicating that you should have simply asked the way. Newman, in a more explicitly neo-Wittgenseinian mode than the one he adopts, might proclaim: Don\xE2\x80\x99t say that \xE2\x80\x9CA is red\xE2\x80\x9D is true if and only if the fact (state of affairs) that A is red exists!\xE2\x80\x94Assert instead: \xE2\x80\x9CA is red\xE2\x80\x9D is true if and only if red is a way A is. This recalls Sellars, about a half-century ago, holding that we don\xE2\x80\x99t have the fact that A is red, we just have \xE2\x80\x9CA is red\xE2\x80\x9D correctly picturing A <i>as</i> red (<i>Science and Metaphysics</i>, p. 136), and we don\xE2\x80\x99t have the fact that A and B exemplify the relation R, we just have A and B in a complex <i>matter-of-factual</i> relation (Ibid, p. 137). Sellars is in neither the index nor the bibliography</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The book is marred by careless phrasing. Thus a \xE2\x80\x9Csubstitutional\xE2\x80\x9D reading of \xE2\x80\x9C(F)(Fa iff Fb) iff a=b\xE2\x80\x9D is given as what \xE2\x80\x9Ccan be said of a can be said of b\xE2\x80\x9D (222). Not really, since one \xE2\x80\x9Ccan say\xE2\x80\x9D anything logically appropriate of a and of b\xE2\x80\x94we are not talking of what \xE2\x80\x9Ccan be said\xE2\x80\x9D about objects but of what \xE2\x80\x9Cis true of\xE2\x80\x9D them. A discussion of identity takes up numerical identity and what is often called the Russell-Leibniz definition of \xE2\x80\x9C=\xE2\x80\x9C. Discussing C. McGinn\xE2\x80\x99s defense of the purported \xE2\x80\x9CFregean Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D that identity is to be characterized by the \xE2\x80\x9Cunique relation a thing has to itself,\xE2\x80\x9D Newman takes up \xE2\x80\x9CLeibniz\xE2\x80\x99s Law\xE2\x80\x9D and the issue of whether identity is to be understood, following McGinn\xE2\x80\x99s apparent view, as primitive, or in terms of the traditional three \xE2\x80\x9Claws\xE2\x80\x9D (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity), or defined by \xE2\x80\x9C(F)(Fa iff Fb) df. a=b.\xE2\x80\x9D Nothing of interest is noted nor is it noted that one rehashes old themes (especially Moore\xE2\x80\x99s and Russell\xE2\x80\x99s distinguishing numerical from conceptual identity going back to Moore\xE2\x80\x99s 1901 paper \xE2\x80\x9CIdentity\xE2\x80\x9D) or that Frege writes: \xE2\x80\x9CNow Leibniz\xE2\x80\x99s definition is as follows: \xE2\x80\x98Things are the same as each other of which one can be substituted for the other without loss of truth.\xE2\x80\x99 This I propose to adopt as my own definition of identity.\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>Grundlagen</i>, sec. 65). Instead, the author is concerned with an \xE2\x80\x9Copening for a <i>modus tollens</i>\xE2\x80\x9D provided by Frege\xE2\x80\x99s taking \xE2\x80\x9Ca=b\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ca=a\xE2\x80\x9D to have different senses. [The <i>modus tollens</i> he won\xE2\x80\x99t get; familiar problems with Fregean semantics, going back to \xE2\x80\x9COn Denoting,\xE2\x80\x9D do arise.] After a number of pages on identity and difference, much of it hinging on the difference between \xE2\x80\x9Ca=a\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ca=b\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94which simply amounts to being able to interpret the latter, but not the former, so that it is false (given standard interpretations and \xE2\x80\x9C=\xE2\x80\x9C being fixed), we are given the author\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatic\xE2\x80\x9D view. It is the purpose of identity sentences \xE2\x80\x9Cto license the merging of files of information, or the applying of two descriptions . . . or the applying of two names to the object referred to.\xE2\x80\x9D On the other hand, \xE2\x80\x9CDifference sentences . . . forbid the merging of files . . . .\xE2\x80\x9D (228) So much for the issues of identity, individuation and diversity.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In discussing the structure of a fact, the author finds it helpful to use hieroglyphs like \xE2\x80\x9C[] () ()\xE2\x80\x9D to speak of the structure of a relational fact, instead of the more familiar \xE2\x80\x9C\xCE\xA3xy.\xE2\x80\x9D He rightly takes a Fregean-style approach to be one that locates the structure in the incompleteness of the predicative component of a fact or proposition. He also finds Grossmann\xE2\x80\x99s variant of an \xE2\x80\x9CIowan\xE2\x80\x9D (a term he borrows from Armstrong) approach odd, as Grossmann gives a Fregean account of relational facts but takes the structure of a monadic fact to be a \xE2\x80\x9Creal unit.\xE2\x80\x9D (I gather that taking it to be a real unit is to take it to be an entity in its own right in the way Frege and Bradley found paradoxical.) He doesn\xE2\x80\x99t note that this \xE2\x80\x9Cpeculiarity\xE2\x80\x9D was also held at times by Russell, given Russell\xE2\x80\x99s view that relations do not require being related to what they relate but that particulars <i>exemplify</i> universal qualities\xE2\x80\x94Bradley was stopped by the first relation, so to speak. (Sometimes Russell, as Newman rightly interprets him, also treated monadic properties as <i>unsaturated</i>, along with relations.) The author\xE2\x80\x99s solution to the problems posed by relational predication, the key theme of the book, is found in a relation being \xE2\x80\x9Cboth an entity and in one sense the <i>way</i> in which the particulars are related\xE2\x80\x9D (148). [Sometimes the relation is just \xE2\x80\x9Cdoing its job\xE2\x80\x9D by relating particulars (98).] So much for facts.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Moreover, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe specific way the particulars are related\xE2\x80\x9D is accounted for by \xE2\x80\x9Cthe mode of predication and by the insertion of different particulars in different slots in the relation itself.\xE2\x80\x9D (148) This is humorous on two counts. First, it happens to be Grossmann\xE2\x80\x99s Fregean-style view (Newman would like Quine\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Methods of Logic</i> using, if I recall rightly, holes (little circles) next to predicates). Second, the author lapses into metaphors and talk of \xE2\x80\x9Cslots\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>places</i> in the relation for Grossmann, and, following him in recent years, for Armstrong) and \xE2\x80\x9Cinsertion.\xE2\x80\x9D This is a \xE2\x80\x9Csolution\xE2\x80\x9D with obvious <i>holes</i> of its own, and one that basically repeats the Fregean pattern while explicitly packing the problem of relational order into the \xE2\x80\x9Cspecific way\xE2\x80\x9D the particulars \xE2\x80\x9Cfill\xE2\x80\x9D the slots (is <i>filling</i> another relation? with its own holes?). Though the notions of \xE2\x80\x9Ctruth condition\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cunit\xE2\x80\x9D occupy crucial roles in the book, neither \xE2\x80\x9Cunit\xE2\x80\x9D nor \xE2\x80\x9Ctruth condition\xE2\x80\x9D occur in the index and we are never really told what a truth condition is or what it is to be a unit (but to think of a unit is to think of a single thing (106), and we apparently have fictional as well as real units (107)).</p>"

  <p>Criticizing Quine\xE2\x80\x99s problematic criterion of ontological commitment, the author ignores the two-fold aspect involved: a criterion for determining the commitments of a schema (language) and the determination of \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat there is\xE2\x80\x9D via employing such a criterion for a schema that fulfills certain criteria\xE2\x80\x94being a \xE2\x80\x9Cminimal\xE2\x80\x9D schema that accommodates the statements of empirical science and mathematics, for example.

  <p>Chapter 3 is typical of the book. It spends the first 13 pages on an elementary discussion of Russell, Wittgenstein and atomic facts, rehearsing various questions that have arisen over the years, but dodging, though touching upon, the critical questions raised by \xE2\x80\x9Cpossibilities\xE2\x80\x9D and false atomic sentences for a correspondence account of truth. As history it is skimpy\xE2\x80\x94as analysis it is empty. At best it calls attention to some issues about nominalistic versus realistic interpretations of the <i>Tractatus</i>\xE2\x80\x94questions about the meaning of \xE2\x80\x9Cstates of affairs,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cpossibilities\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cfacts\xE2\x80\x9D (one could have added \xE2\x80\x9Cpossible states of affairs\xE2\x80\x9D) without really probing into anything. The next five pages introduce a symbolic apparatus to make the simple point, made by a Russell in one sentence (which the author footnotes), that the sentence \xE2\x80\x9CaRb,\xE2\x80\x9D having three terms (on a standard reading) in a juxtaposition \xE2\x80\x9Crelation,\xE2\x80\x9D is of a different form than the purported corresponding fact having two terms standing in the relation R. (But then there is Sellars\xE2\x80\x99 reading, which is neither raised nor discussed, that purports to offer a way around the obvious objection\xE2\x80\x94which Russell, but not the author, also noted and discussed.) The book slides by the interesting issues of logical form and order in facts with brief footnotes mentioning Russell\xE2\x80\x99s taking them up in the 1913 <i>Theory of Knowledge</i> manuscript.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In a section entitled \xE2\x80\x9CCorrespondence without Facts\xE2\x80\x9D the author sets out, and appears to endorse, the view that it suffices to hold that a predicative sentence is true if and only if \xE2\x80\x9CThe particulars referred to by the proper names in the sentence actually instantiate the universal referred to by the predicate in the sentence\xE2\x80\x9D (76) and the order \xE2\x80\x9Cof the proper names in the sentence reflects the order of the particulars under the universal.\xE2\x80\x9D This, of course, raises the obvious issues about \xE2\x80\x9Cactually instantiate\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cunder the universal,\xE2\x80\x9D as well as the less obvious one involving an account of the \xE2\x80\x9Corder of the particulars.\xE2\x80\x9D Obvious but, when all is said and done, simply dismissed. More about this below.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Chapter IV deals with Russell\xE2\x80\x99s theory of truth and views on acquaintance. It is misleadingly stated, \xE2\x80\x9CThe notion of acquaintance is such that the objects of acquaintance are limited to things like sense data.\xE2\x80\x9D (90) No way\xE2\x80\x94universal relations, logical forms (whether they are \xE2\x80\x9Centities\xE2\x80\x9D or not), universal properties, common qualities (as constituents of bundles of qualities, rather than \xE2\x80\x9Cadjectives\xE2\x80\x9D of particulars), even mental acts in the years prior to 1919, are also typically \xE2\x80\x9Cobjects\xE2\x80\x9D of acquaintance (possibly even selves in 1912, if one recalls the discussion of Bismarck). The author proceeds to hold that, for Russell, a belief \xE2\x80\x9Cappears to be an act of a person\xE2\x80\x9D and that Russell says that he uses the terms \xE2\x80\x9Cbelief\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cjudgment\xE2\x80\x9D as synonyms, but \xE2\x80\x9Cboth terms are ambiguous\xE2\x80\x9D in that each can \xE2\x80\x9Cmean either the <i>act</i> of a person or the <i>content</i> of that act.\xE2\x80\x9D Again\xE2\x80\x94not right. For Russell, the terms indicate universal relations, on the multiple-relation theory (whether the same relation or not is immaterial\xE2\x80\x94though \xE2\x80\x9Cunderstanding\xE2\x80\x9D was sometimes used as the generic term, \xE2\x80\x9Cjudgment\xE2\x80\x9D as a determinate form of an \xE2\x80\x9Cunderstanding\xE2\x80\x9D relation). The \xE2\x80\x9Ccontent\xE2\x80\x9D is what is taken as the proposition in the 1913 manuscript and a \xE2\x80\x9Cperson\xE2\x80\x9D plays the role of the traditional act in that manuscript. Though there are numerous statements by Russell that propositions do not exist, the matter is complicated. Russell\xE2\x80\x99s propositions are neither Fregean senses of sentences nor Moore\xE2\x80\x99s content properties, but \xE2\x80\x9Cforms,\xE2\x80\x9D albeit not logical forms, of particular understanding facts. (Being forms, they do not occur as constituent terms in the analysis of belief facts such as\xE2\x80\x94Believes(Othello, loves, a, b).) Such forms are not logical forms since they can \xE2\x80\x9Ccontain\xE2\x80\x9D non-logical \xE2\x80\x9Cconstants,\xE2\x80\x9D as in what is indicated by \xE2\x80\x9CU(S, loves, a, b)\xE2\x80\x9D with \xE2\x80\x9CU\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CS\xE2\x80\x9D as variables ranging over \xE2\x80\x9Cintentional\xE2\x80\x9D relations and persons, respectively. It expresses the content (proposition) that a loves b. (Though Russell uses expressions with free variables, he reads them as existential quantifications.)</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The multiple-relation theory marks not only the attempt to dispense with Fregean style propositions but is probably the beginning of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s dispensing with Moore\xE2\x80\x99s (Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s) mental acts, which he does in published form in 1921 in <i>The Analysis of Mind</i>, after disposing of the self in 1919 (in 1918 in unpublished papers). Eventually all basic standard particulars will be dispensed with in 1940\xE2\x80\x94the term \xE2\x80\x9Cstandard\xE2\x80\x9D is to note that in 1940 he will call common qualities of objects (construed as bundles of qualities) \xE2\x80\x9Cparticulars.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>For Newman, as it turns out, (122 ff) propositions are \xE2\x80\x9Creal units\xE2\x80\x9D since they can be thought <i>about</i> as well as simply \xE2\x80\x9Cthought.\xE2\x80\x9D They are things that \xE2\x80\x9Coccur in belief contexts\xE2\x80\x9D and can be abstracted from such contexts (123) and in that sense are \xE2\x80\x9Cabstract.\xE2\x80\x9D Thus the author repeats, in different words, Russell\xE2\x80\x99s 1913 view taking propositions as forms (but not logical forms) of belief, etc. facts\xE2\x80\x94since he, like Bergmann, takes them as instantiated \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversals.\xE2\x80\x9D Facts, it turns out, are not units.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The discussion of the multiple-relation theory is guided by various recent secondary sources and not a result of a careful examination of the original texts. It cites three \xE2\x80\x9Cmost serious\xE2\x80\x9D criticisms as problems. Two are not problems at all, on a proper understanding of the theory, and the third is basically Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s well known criticism that Russell discussed in the 1918 logical atomism lectures\xE2\x80\x94the problem of a relation functioning as both a term, in a belief fact, and as a \xE2\x80\x9Crelating\xE2\x80\x9D relation to help \xE2\x80\x9Cunify\xE2\x80\x9D the content. The author doesn\xE2\x80\x99t grasp the implication of saying that a type distinction between particulars and relations excludes \xE2\x80\x9Cgrosser impossibilities\xE2\x80\x9D (135)\xE2\x80\x94and thus that only certain nonsensical combinations are \xE2\x80\x9Cpossible.\xE2\x80\x9D For then one might as well say that the terms and their ordering have to be such as to form a meaningful sentence\xE2\x80\x94thus giving up the theory\xE2\x80\x94which is Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s point, and led to Russell\xE2\x80\x99s 1918 discussion. What the author also misses is the serious problem raised by Russell\xE2\x80\x99s transforming the multiple-relation theory, in cases with relational contents, into one employing a dyadic relation holding between a person and a purported existential fact (or a purported fact denoted by a definite description). For such facts do not exist when the belief (judgment) is false.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The book proposes to advance a realist account of universals (and particulars) but to avoid facts in setting out a correspondence theory of truth. So one is intrigued as to how it will be done. The answer comes as a ripple in the wave of current talk about ontological free lunches, supervenience, non-additions to being, fusions that are no more than what is fused, etc. etc. Here it is even simpler\xE2\x80\x94minimalist one might say. Consider a red object. There is the particular object, A, and the property red. But there is no need for the fact that the object is red to ground the truth that A is red. No, all we need note is that the property is a \xE2\x80\x9Cway\xE2\x80\x9D the object is. That takes care of facts and all the problems about predication\xE2\x80\x94end of story. The move is familiar from attempts to deal with the Frege-Bradley regress by taking <i>exemplification</i> to be dependent on A and red, and hence not really a relation giving rise to a further relational state of affairs. Thus the fact of A\xE2\x80\x99s being red will purportedly do. Here it goes one step further. All we need are A and red, since red is a way A is. That is all there is to it and is why the reader is treated to many words about the need for instantiation. (Actually, the specific move is also familiar from variants of trope theories\xE2\x80\x94where a specific red trope (or a specific \xE2\x80\x9Cinstantiated\xE2\x80\x9D relational trope) is \xE2\x80\x9Cinternally\xE2\x80\x9D tied or related\xE2\x80\x94hence there is not \xE2\x80\x9Creally\xE2\x80\x9D a connection or relation\xE2\x80\x94 to the particular red object (pair of related objects) it is the quality of (relates).) Thus there is no need to talk of any instantiation relation or compositional connection\xE2\x80\x94depending on the kind of trope theory. One can imagine Ryle pointing out the way to a pub if asked if it were indeed a fact that there was a pub nearby, thus pointedly indicating that you should have simply asked the way. Newman, in a more explicitly neo-Wittgenseinian mode than the one he adopts, might proclaim: Don\xE2\x80\x99t say that \xE2\x80\x9CA is red\xE2\x80\x9D is true if and only if the fact (state of affairs) that A is red exists!\xE2\x80\x94Assert instead: \xE2\x80\x9CA is red\xE2\x80\x9D is true if and only if red is a way A is. This recalls Sellars, about a half-century ago, holding that we don\xE2\x80\x99t have the fact that A is red, we just have \xE2\x80\x9CA is red\xE2\x80\x9D correctly picturing A <i>as</i> red (<i>Science and Metaphysics</i>, p. 136), and we don\xE2\x80\x99t have the fact that A and B exemplify the relation R, we just have A and B in a complex <i>matter-of-factual</i> relation (Ibid, p. 137). Sellars is in neither the index nor the bibliography</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The book is marred by careless phrasing. Thus a \xE2\x80\x9Csubstitutional\xE2\x80\x9D reading of \xE2\x80\x9C(F)(Fa iff Fb) iff a=b\xE2\x80\x9D is given as what \xE2\x80\x9Ccan be said of a can be said of b\xE2\x80\x9D (222). Not really, since one \xE2\x80\x9Ccan say\xE2\x80\x9D anything logically appropriate of a and of b\xE2\x80\x94we are not talking of what \xE2\x80\x9Ccan be said\xE2\x80\x9D about objects but of what \xE2\x80\x9Cis true of\xE2\x80\x9D them. A discussion of identity takes up numerical identity and what is often called the Russell-Leibniz definition of \xE2\x80\x9C=\xE2\x80\x9C. Discussing C. McGinn\xE2\x80\x99s defense of the purported \xE2\x80\x9CFregean Thesis\xE2\x80\x9D that identity is to be characterized by the \xE2\x80\x9Cunique relation a thing has to itself,\xE2\x80\x9D Newman takes up \xE2\x80\x9CLeibniz\xE2\x80\x99s Law\xE2\x80\x9D and the issue of whether identity is to be understood, following McGinn\xE2\x80\x99s apparent view, as primitive, or in terms of the traditional three \xE2\x80\x9Claws\xE2\x80\x9D (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity), or defined by \xE2\x80\x9C(F)(Fa iff Fb) df. a=b.\xE2\x80\x9D Nothing of interest is noted nor is it noted that one rehashes old themes (especially Moore\xE2\x80\x99s and Russell\xE2\x80\x99s distinguishing numerical from conceptual identity going back to Moore\xE2\x80\x99s 1901 paper \xE2\x80\x9CIdentity\xE2\x80\x9D) or that Frege writes: \xE2\x80\x9CNow Leibniz\xE2\x80\x99s definition is as follows: \xE2\x80\x98Things are the same as each other of which one can be substituted for the other without loss of truth.\xE2\x80\x99 This I propose to adopt as my own definition of identity.\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>Grundlagen</i>, sec. 65). Instead, the author is concerned with an \xE2\x80\x9Copening for a <i>modus tollens</i>\xE2\x80\x9D provided by Frege\xE2\x80\x99s taking \xE2\x80\x9Ca=b\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ca=a\xE2\x80\x9D to have different senses. [The <i>modus tollens</i> he won\xE2\x80\x99t get; familiar problems with Fregean semantics, going back to \xE2\x80\x9COn Denoting,\xE2\x80\x9D do arise.] After a number of pages on identity and difference, much of it hinging on the difference between \xE2\x80\x9Ca=a\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ca=b\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94which simply amounts to being able to interpret the latter, but not the former, so that it is false (given standard interpretations and \xE2\x80\x9C=\xE2\x80\x9C being fixed), we are given the author\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cpragmatic\xE2\x80\x9D view. It is the purpose of identity sentences \xE2\x80\x9Cto license the merging of files of information, or the applying of two descriptions . . . or the applying of two names to the object referred to.\xE2\x80\x9D On the other hand, \xE2\x80\x9CDifference sentences . . . forbid the merging of files . . . .\xE2\x80\x9D (228) So much for the issues of identity, individuation and diversity.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In discussing the structure of a fact, the author finds it helpful to use hieroglyphs like \xE2\x80\x9C[] () ()\xE2\x80\x9D to speak of the structure of a relational fact, instead of the more familiar \xE2\x80\x9C\xCE\xA3xy.\xE2\x80\x9D He rightly takes a Fregean-style approach to be one that locates the structure in the incompleteness of the predicative component of a fact or proposition. He also finds Grossmann\xE2\x80\x99s variant of an \xE2\x80\x9CIowan\xE2\x80\x9D (a term he borrows from Armstrong) approach odd, as Grossmann gives a Fregean account of relational facts but takes the structure of a monadic fact to be a \xE2\x80\x9Creal unit.\xE2\x80\x9D (I gather that taking it to be a real unit is to take it to be an entity in its own right in the way Frege and Bradley found paradoxical.) He doesn\xE2\x80\x99t note that this \xE2\x80\x9Cpeculiarity\xE2\x80\x9D was also held at times by Russell, given Russell\xE2\x80\x99s view that relations do not require being related to what they relate but that particulars <i>exemplify</i> universal qualities\xE2\x80\x94Bradley was stopped by the first relation, so to speak. (Sometimes Russell, as Newman rightly interprets him, also treated monadic properties as <i>unsaturated</i>, along with relations.) The author\xE2\x80\x99s solution to the problems posed by relational predication, the key theme of the book, is found in a relation being \xE2\x80\x9Cboth an entity and in one sense the <i>way</i> in which the particulars are related\xE2\x80\x9D (148). [Sometimes the relation is just \xE2\x80\x9Cdoing its job\xE2\x80\x9D by relating particulars (98).] So much for facts.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Moreover, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe specific way the particulars are related\xE2\x80\x9D is accounted for by \xE2\x80\x9Cthe mode of predication and by the insertion of different particulars in different slots in the relation itself.\xE2\x80\x9D (148) This is humorous on two counts. First, it happens to be Grossmann\xE2\x80\x99s Fregean-style view (Newman would like Quine\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Methods of Logic</i> using, if I recall rightly, holes (little circles) next to predicates). Second, the author lapses into metaphors and talk of \xE2\x80\x9Cslots\xE2\x80\x9D (<i>places</i> in the relation for Grossmann, and, following him in recent years, for Armstrong) and \xE2\x80\x9Cinsertion.\xE2\x80\x9D This is a \xE2\x80\x9Csolution\xE2\x80\x9D with obvious <i>holes</i> of its own, and one that basically repeats the Fregean pattern while explicitly packing the problem of relational order into the \xE2\x80\x9Cspecific way\xE2\x80\x9D the particulars \xE2\x80\x9Cfill\xE2\x80\x9D the slots (is <i>filling</i> another relation? with its own holes?). Though the notions of \xE2\x80\x9Ctruth condition\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cunit\xE2\x80\x9D occupy crucial roles in the book, neither \xE2\x80\x9Cunit\xE2\x80\x9D nor \xE2\x80\x9Ctruth condition\xE2\x80\x9D occur in the index and we are never really told what a truth condition is or what it is to be a unit (but to think of a unit is to think of a single thing (106), and we apparently have fictional as well as real units (107)).</p>"
