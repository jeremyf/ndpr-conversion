content: "<p>For over three centuries, Newtonian science has provided the backdrop for discussions of the epistemological and ontological implications of empirical science. Philosophers interested in the impact of Newtonian science on the development of philosophy thus face the daunting task of teasing the historical truth from three centuries of elaborations and myths regarding Newton and his intellectual legacy. The current volume has the explicit dual goal of peeling away a number of prevailing misconceptions and introducing Newtonian science to a philosophical audience. In both regards, it is a success. The <i>Companion</i> is bound to become a standard reference work, and it is indispensable for scholars and newcomers interested in 17th and 18th century natural philosophy. Thus it is unfortunate that the volume\xE2\x80\x99s excellent coverage of some aspects of Newton scholarship does not extend more broadly. There is a clear division between Newton\xE2\x80\x99s scientific work (roughly two thirds of the volume) and the work of the \xE2\x80\x9Cother Newton\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 the natural philosopher, theologian, and alchemist revealed through unpublished manuscripts studied over the last four decades. The <i>Companion</i> gives a clear overview of the aspects of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s work that had the greatest immediate impact on his contemporaries, at the cost of neglecting Newton\xE2\x80\x99s connections with earlier philosophical traditions that are only hinted at in his published works.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>As with other volumes in the <i>Cambridge Companion</i> series, the editors commissioned original essays (16 in total) and supplemented these with an introduction and bibliography. The essays regarding the \xE2\x80\x9Ctechnical Newton\xE2\x80\x9D reap the substantial rewards of a recent resurgence of interest in careful reconstructions of Newtonian science and methodology. Below we will follow one of the volume\xE2\x80\x99s threads- \xE2\x80\x93 concerning Newton\xE2\x80\x99s methodology and its philosophical consequences \xE2\x80\x93 through the essays of Alan Shapiro, William Harper, George Smith, Howard Stein, and Robert DiSalle. These essays carefully and convincingly demonstrate that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s methodological advances and ontological commitments must be understood in relation to his attempts to address a set of well-defined empirical concerns. However, we would like to stress that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s thinking should not be understood as addressing those concerns <i>exclusively</i>. As some of the remaining, much briefer essays concerning the \xE2\x80\x9Cother Newton\xE2\x80\x9D show, Newton saw himself not only as tackling the technical requirements of framing a new physics, but as responding to traditional philosophical and theological worries. What is missing from the <i>Companion</i> is a clear vision of how these two motivations dovetail with one another, or an argument that there was in fact little interplay between these pursuits. Niccol\xC3\xB2 Guicciardini\xE2\x80\x99s and Maurizio Mamiani\xE2\x80\x99s essays are of note in this regard, since they suggest how a reconciliation of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CJanus faces\xE2\x80\x9D may be reached.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Newton first declared that his experimental research embodied a new mode of inquiry in his early optical publications (1672-76). Critics such as Hooke rejected Newton\xE2\x80\x99s claims to have established results \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout any suspicion of doubts\xE2\x80\x9D and argued that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s results depended upon an unacknowledged hypothesis: that light consists of small corpuscles. Newton found this misconstrual of his work so infuriating that he bitterly withdrew from public discussions of natural philosophy for nearly a decade. Shapiro\xE2\x80\x99s masterful overview of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s optical research focuses on these methodological debates. Shapiro argues convincingly in Newton\xE2\x80\x99s favor regarding the early disputes: the central innovation in his theory of color, namely that white light is composed of rays of differing refrangability, does not depend upon the corpuscular hypothesis. Although Newton later used the corpuscular hypothesis to account for dispersion, refraction, and the colors of thin films, Shapiro explains that the hypothesis met with only qualitative successes and several failures. Newton was keenly aware of its limitations, and thus found his critics\xE2\x80\x99 tendency to blur the line between it and results \xE2\x80\x9Cdemonstrated by experiments\xE2\x80\x9D particularly galling. Nevertheless, Newton did not always draw such a sharp line between conjectures and certainties. In 1675 he introduced aether vibrations to account for periodic behavior he had carefully observed in his study of \xE2\x80\x9CNewton\xE2\x80\x99s rings.\xE2\x80\x9D In the <i>Opticks</i> this conjecture was transformed into \xE2\x80\x9Cfits of easy reflection and refraction\xE2\x80\x9D and presented as an established principle (p. 245). But what legitimated this elevation \xE2\x80\x93 or the elevated status of other ideas, such as the atomic theory of matter? Shapiro\xE2\x80\x99s essay ultimately raises more questions than it answers regarding the ways in which conjectures receive sufficient warrant to become established principles.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Newton\xE2\x80\x99s contemporaries and subsequent scholars have long attempted to answer these and other questions in light of the <i>Principia</i> and Newton\xE2\x80\x99s various methodological pronouncements. Smith\xE2\x80\x99s contribution draws together a number of insights regarding Newtonian methodology based on an extremely thorough reading of the <i>Principia</i>. This essay and Harper\xE2\x80\x99s line-by-line reconstruction of the argument for universal gravitation both emphasize several contrasts between Newton\xE2\x80\x99s and earlier \xE2\x80\x9Chypothetico-deductive\xE2\x80\x9D methodology. The <i>Principia</i> introduces a general mathematical theory of forces that has few (if any) direct consequences for observed phenomena without constraints provided by observations. The mathematical apparatus of Books I and II links characteristics of forces to observed features of motion, either in terms of specific parameters or general qualitative features. The theory is not tested by checking directly measurable quantities; instead, observations are used to \xE2\x80\x9Cdeduce\xE2\x80\x9D the features of postulated forces, and then the framework generates a variety of consequences of the postulated force law. Smith and Harper both stress that Newton counted agreement between independent measures of a force as significant evidence in favor of the theory. For example, the famous \xE2\x80\x9Cmoon test\xE2\x80\x9D in proposition III.4 emphasizes the precise numerical agreement between the moon\xE2\x80\x99s one-second falling distance (measured using orbital parameters) and the same distance for bodies in Paris (measured with Huygens\xE2\x80\x99 seconds pendulum). Harper\xE2\x80\x99s <i>leitmotif</i> is that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s argument for universal gravitation proceeds by showing that independent measures of \xE2\x80\x9Ccausal parameters\xE2\x80\x9D for the force of gravity converge on stable values and that this convergence constitutes empirical success.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Several other aspects of the methodology in the <i>Principia</i> are highlighted in Smith\xE2\x80\x99s rich essay, of which we will mention only the interplay between approximation and idealization. Newton clearly stated one of the obstacles to gleaning an understanding of forces from the phenomena of planetary motion: \xE2\x80\x9CBut to consider simultaneously all these causes of [planetary] motion and to define these motions by exact laws admitting of easy calculation exceeds, if I am not mistaken, the force of any human mind\xE2\x80\x9D (quoted on p. 153). Newton responded by carefully ensuring that his arguments from the phenomena hold even in the face of inexactitude. We can illustrate the idea with a simple contrast: if a planet sweeps out nearly equal areas in equal times, the force holding it in orbit is approximately centripetal (as Newton shows in corollaries to proposition I.3); however, a body can move in an approximately elliptical orbit with a force law that is not even approximately inverse square (see Smith 2002). The argument for universal gravitation relies on inferences like the former, whose consequent holds approximately if the antecedent only holds approximately. In addition, Newton clearly recognized the importance of approaching the complexities of real motions via a series of successive approximations. Briefly, Smith argues that at each stage of approximation remaining differences between observations and the \xE2\x80\x9Cexact theory\xE2\x80\x9D point the way towards further refinements. Here Smith draws on Cohen\xE2\x80\x99s earlier work on the \xE2\x80\x9CNewtonian Style\xE2\x80\x9D but adds considerable sophistication: the successive approximations are not just a matter of ensuring mathematical tractability; they also allow one to bring further evidence to bear on the theory. As Curtis Wilson\xE2\x80\x99s essay shows in detail, Newton\xE2\x80\x99s various proposals in Book III for extending gravitational theory inspired a long process of refinement and reformulation throughout the 18th and 19th centuries that <i>eventually</i> led to satisfactory accounts of lunar motion, the inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn, etc. Smith rightly emphasizes this often unappreciated, progressive aspect of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s methodology: the framework of the <i>Principia</i> provided fruitful ways of using evidence to refine theory well into the 20th century.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>To their credit, these essays clearly rebut quick dismissals of the \xE2\x80\x9Cmad Newtonian methodology\xE2\x80\x9D of deduction from the phenomena as a \xE2\x80\x9Cjoke\xE2\x80\x9D (to quote Lakatos), dismissals that were prevalent among philosophers of science a generation ago. However, both Harper and Smith tend towards an unabashedly modern reading of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s methodology, drawing on recent work in philosophy of science. Although both essays amply illustrate the fruits of this approach, their utility for historians of philosophy and science are less clear. For example, Harper\xE2\x80\x99s claim that \xE2\x80\x9Cthose qualities of bodies that cannot be intended or remitted [Newton\xE2\x80\x99s criterion in the third rule of philosophizing] are those that count as constant parameter values\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 188) throws doubt on the adequacy of Harper\xE2\x80\x99s notion of \xE2\x80\x9Cparameter value.\xE2\x80\x9D Is the quality of \xE2\x80\x9Csolidity\xE2\x80\x9D to be taken as a parameter value? Generally, Harper interprets the <i>Regul\xC3\xA6 Philosophandi</i> as \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing backed by an ideal of empirical success\xE2\x80\x9D as defined by him (p.185), thereby neglecting the literature (such as Maurizio Mamiani\xE2\x80\x99s essay in the present volume) on their conceptual genealogy and the metaphysics that, in Newton\xE2\x80\x99s eyes, backed their usefulness as methodological rules (see also McGuire 1970). The <i>Companion</i> overlooks existing literature on several similar issues. I. B. Cohen\xE2\x80\x99s essay introduces Newton\xE2\x80\x99s concepts of force and mass through a discussion of the definitions and laws of motion at the opening of the <i>Principia</i>. At the end of a brief discussion of <i>vis insita</i> and <i>vis inertia</i> (introduced in Definitions 3 and 4), Cohen remarks that \xE2\x80\x9CNewton never explained why he wrote of a <i>vis inertiae</i>, a \xE2\x80\x98force of inertia,\xE2\x80\x99 rather than a property of inertia and we have no basis for guessing what was his state of mind\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 62). While it is true that from a modern point of view Newton\xE2\x80\x99s language is extremely puzzling, other commentators have argued that it reflects his indebtedness to Aristotelian thought and to the associated ontology that regards <i>vis insita</i> as an internal causal principle that generates inertial motion rather than treating it as an uncaused \xE2\x80\x9Cstate of motion\xE2\x80\x9D (see McGuire 1994, McMullin 1978).</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Guicciardini\xE2\x80\x99s essay successfully demonstrates how sensitivity to the conceptual milieu of the 17th century can be fruitfully combined with attention to technical detail. By 1671 Newton had developed the methods of fluxional analysis to such a degree that he outstripped all his contemporaries, but rather than publish his work Newton came to doubt the value of the symbolic techniques he had so thoroughly mastered. Guicciardini situates Newton\xE2\x80\x99s developing preference for a \xE2\x80\x9Cgeometrical style\xE2\x80\x9D against the backdrop of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s own admiration of ancient knowledge and the broader \xE2\x80\x9Cgeometrical backlash\xE2\x80\x9D against algebraic methods represented by Barrow and Hobbes. Newton\xE2\x80\x99s preference for a geometrical style had a remarkable impact on his later work, including the \xE2\x80\x9Csynthetic account of fluxions\xE2\x80\x9D given in the <i>Geometria Curvilinea</i> and, most notably, the mathematical methods used in the <i>Principia</i>. We hope this essay will inspire similar research into Newton\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy of mathematics, a topic that has too often taken a back seat to investigations of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s natural philosophy.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>In the <i>Companion\xE2\x80\x99s</i> longest contribution and its centerpiece, Stein develops an account of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysics rich in philosophical context. Motivated by a careful reading of an unpublished manuscript known as \xE2\x80\x9CDe Grav,\xE2\x80\x9D Stein focuses on Newton\xE2\x80\x99s strikingly original conceptions of space, body, and force and illustrates how Newton\xE2\x80\x99s ontological claims grew out of a need to adequately define the basic concepts of his physics. One of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s main philosophical innovations, as Stein makes admirably clear, was to make metaphysics beholden to the findings of physics, thereby inverting the tree of knowledge as conceived by his contemporaries, notably Descartes. This emphasis on the . <i>posteriori</i> nature of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s reasoning is one of the overarching philosophical morals of the <i>Companion</i>. Stein supports this general thesis by showing how Newton\xE2\x80\x99s concepts of motion, space, and body were defined in relation to the findings of the senses, not a set of . <i>priori</i> principles. Stein stresses that Newton develops an account of body as \xE2\x80\x9Cmoving regions of impenetrability\xE2\x80\x9D that is meant to be <i>sufficient</i> to account for experience, while rejecting a Lockean demand for a deeper understanding of the <i>necessity</i> of this account of the constitution of matter. Stein characterizes this fundamental conceptual shift as one away from an emphasis on the substantial unity underlying the various attributes of matter toward a \xE2\x80\x9Cfield\xE2\x80\x9D conception: \xE2\x80\x9Cin creating a body, God (or in the \xE2\x80\x9Cconstitution\xE2\x80\x9D of a body, <i>nature</i>) must impose, not only the field of impenetrability and the laws of motion appropriate thereto, but other fields as well, with their laws, characterizing forces of interaction \xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D (pp. 288-89). The nature of the laws of motion and their relation to matter has been a recurring theme in Newton scholarship, and Stein\xE2\x80\x99s essay is certainly an important contribution to these ongoing debates.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Throughout his essay Stein advocates a reading of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysics that downplays the relevance of his theological views; he comments that studies linking Newton\xE2\x80\x99s ontology to his theological views are \xE2\x80\x9Cat variance with <i>at least</i> the epistemological side of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s own metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 297, f.n. 17, emphasis added). The emanative nature of space as presented in \xE2\x80\x9CDe Grav\xE2\x80\x9D is taken as a case in point (pp. 267-272). According to Stein, Newton urges that space be understood as a logical consequence of the existence of God or <i>any other</i> being, not a causal effect conditional on His essence. Consequently, deliberations regarding the essence of God are unnecessary for understanding the nature of space; as Newton puts it: \xE2\x80\x9Cwe have an absolute Idea of [extension] without any relationship to God\xE2\x80\x9D (p.271). Stein is in agreement here with existing literature on the subject. Other commentators have defended a similar claim, namely that space is a transcendental condition for <i>any</i> existent and is thus not dependent on God\xE2\x80\x99s particular essence (see McGuire (1990) and Carriero (1990)). However, from the thesis that <i>according to Newton</i> the content of the idea of space does not depend on the content of the idea of God, Stein draws the conclusion that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysics of space is independent from his theology. Although the antecedent is unproblematic, the consequent, which is embodied in Stein\xE2\x80\x99s denial of the claim that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe basic conceptions of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s natural philosophy, most especially his conception of space and time, [are] derivative from, or grounded in, this theology\xE2\x80\x9D (quote from McGuire on p.297, f.n. 17) does not follow. We would like to stress this point, at the risk of sounding overly critical of Stein\xE2\x80\x99s fine essay, in response to a general inclination of many of the essays in the <i>Companion</i> to emphasize Newton\xE2\x80\x99s scientific acumen while underestimating his concern with traditional philosophical debates regarding method and ontology.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Alan Gabbey\xE2\x80\x99s essay on Newton\xE2\x80\x99s relation to the mechanical philosophy stands out as going against this general trend. Regarding the current topic, Gabbey argues that in \xE2\x80\x9CDe Grav\xE2\x80\x9D Newton rejects the Cartesian conception of <i>res extensa</i> in favor of an emanationist view of space to preclude the possibility of understanding the existence of body without reference to an act of God, as well as to account for the possibility of a coherent mind-body union. Gabbey\xE2\x80\x99s meandering essay describes the disciplinary context of 17th-century natural philosophy, mathematics, and metaphysics and argues that although Newton is primarily a natural philosopher and mathematician, he also addressed metaphysical problems. While it is unclear how Newton himself conceived the relationship of his research to these problems, Gabbey stresses that \xE2\x80\x9Cthere are metaphysical aspects of his natural philosophy that are crucial to an adequate understanding of\xE2\x80\xA6 his engagement with the mechanical philosophy, and\xE2\x80\xA6 his account of the causal interventions of mind and soul in the physical world\xE2\x80\x9D (p.333). On the first count, Gabbey notes that Newton advocated explanations using non-material agents whose actions did not proceed with the type of \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical necessity\xE2\x80\x9D required by the likes of Boyle, Descartes, and Gassendi. On the second, he shows how Newton\xE2\x80\x99s belief that an act of human will can create corporeal motions\xE2\x80\x94possibly violating the 3rd law of motion\xE2\x80\x94colors much of his analysis of space and body. In either case, Gabbey makes amply clear how Newton\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysical views bore directly on his natural philosophy. Likewise, the essays of Carriero and McGuire cited above demonstrate that Newton was concerned with harmonizing his theory of space with traditional theological concerns regarding God\xE2\x80\x99s essence, His causal efficacy, and His being in the world.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s essay on the status of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cdefinitions\xE2\x80\x9D of space and time complements Stein\xE2\x80\x99s piece by elucidating the way in which these notions were <i>required</i> by Newtonian physics. Reichenbach once characterized Newton\xE2\x80\x99s absolute space and time as a \xE2\x80\x9Cmystical philosophical superstructure,\xE2\x80\x9D to be criticized on the broadly philosophical grounds suggested by Leibniz, Mach and Einstein. DiSalle follows recent work in philosophy of space and time in rejecting this view, and developing in its place an \xE2\x80\x9Cempiricist\xE2\x80\x9D account that emphasizes the empirical content acquired by the ideas of space and time within the framework of Newtonian physics. On this account, Newton\xE2\x80\x99s main concern in the famous scholium following the laws is <i>not</i> a proof of the existence of absolute space, but rather an assessment of the definitions of space and time already <i>implicit</i> in dynamical reasoning about motion and its causes by Newton and his contemporaries. The scholium presents a series of arguments to the effect that various properties of motion cannot be analyzed in terms of relative time and space. (See, in particular, Rynasiewicz 1995 for a careful reading of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s scholium complementary to DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s essay.) Newton\xE2\x80\x99s main target here, as in the \xE2\x80\x9CDe Grav,\xE2\x80\x9D is Descartes, and his attempt to combine a dynamics attributing a unique state of motion or rest to bodies with a relational account of motion that cannot underwrite such a distinction. As DiSalle explains, in response Newton introduced more structure than his physics actually required: the distinction between accelerated and uniform motion is crucial to identifying forces, but the attribution of forces does not, as Newton thought, differentiate between states of motion with respect to absolute space (pp. 40-42). Newton did not introduce \xE2\x80\x9Cfictitious forces\xE2\x80\x9D that are <i>caused</i> by motion with respect to absolute space; rather, forces and inertial effects <i>define</i> true motions, in the sense of providing empirical criteria for determining a body\xE2\x80\x99s true state of motion within the framework of the <i>Principia</i>. However, we are not convinced that this emphasis on the definitional nature of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s claims regarding space and time will dissolve the \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute vs. relational\xE2\x80\x9D debate entirely, as DiSalle seems to suggest. We should further remark that DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s vocabulary does not follow Newton\xE2\x80\x99s own: DiSalle often characterizes the Laws as defining \xE2\x80\x9Cspace,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Ctime,\xE2\x80\x9D and even \xE2\x80\x9Cimpressed force\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 45), which is at odds with the <i>Principia</i>\xE2\x80\x99s explicit separation between the Laws, Definitions, and consequences of both conjointly. But we are only pointing out a missed opportunity: attention to this point would have aided DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s overall argument. In any case, DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s essay is a lucid reconstruction of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of space and time.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Two of the remaining essays include more technical detail than the rest of the volume, and are probably less suitable for the intended audience of the <i>Companion</i>. Bruce Brackenridge and Michael Nauenberg give a concise account of their recent work regarding Newton\xE2\x80\x99s use of curvature as a measure of force. This essay advocates a major change in the understanding of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s development of the concept of force and the appropriate mathematical tools for studying dynamics. According to Brackenridge and Nauenberg, curvature played a decisive role in generalizing the concept of force beyond the case of uniform circular motion in Newton\xE2\x80\x99s thinking from the mid 60s until the 80s. The curvature measure has been overlooked because the first edition of the <i>Principia</i> relied mainly on a geometrical measure of force, but Brackenridge and Nauenberg trace its use through early dynamical works, Newton\xE2\x80\x99s correspondence with Hooke in 1679-80, and revisions of the <i>Principia.</i> Curtis Wilson\xE2\x80\x99s contribution describes celestial mechanics before and after Newton, emphasizing the treatment of Kepler\xE2\x80\x99s so-called laws prior to the <i>Principia</i> and dispelling the common misconception that the <i>Principia</i> itself fully established the implications of universal gravitation for celestial mechanics.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Unfortunately we do not have space to discuss the shorter essays from the last third of the volume in much detail. William Newman and Karin Figala discuss Newton\xE2\x80\x99s alchemy, emphasizing his indebtedness to a number of contemporaries and the tight connection between his matter theory and alchemical research. Together the essays total only 28 pages, providing a very brief introduction to one of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s major intellectual pursuits. Newman analyzes various texts in which Newton appeals to a Helmontian \xE2\x80\x9Cshell theory\xE2\x80\x9D of matter to explain chemical phenomena. Figala focuses on the influence of the overtly theological work of Sendivogius and the German Rosicrucian Maier on Newton\xE2\x80\x99s alchemical studies. Scott Mandelbrote\xE2\x80\x99s essay recounts the impact of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s unorthodox theological writings on debates among 18th century divines. Newton\xE2\x80\x99s growing authority in other matters did not compel the admiration of the theologians, who seemed to relish the chance to dismantle his arguments in the (posthumously published) <i>Chronology of Ancient Kingdom\xE2\x80\x99s Amended</i> (pp. 414-17). Mamiani recounts Newton\xE2\x80\x99s rules for biblical exegesis as set out in the <i>Treatise on Apocalypse</i> and their relation to dream interpretation. Newton believed that these domains could be understood through a search for correspondences between types of actions or structures, i.e., by analogy. For example, analogy can be found between the chromatic scale and the tonal scale or between the relationship of tension and tones in a string and the law of gravity. These correspondences allow Newton to find within the writings of the prophets indicators of the true structure of the universe, itself a form of God\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cwriting\xE2\x80\x9D. Mamiani traces the source of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s method for interpreting scripture as well as his <i>Regulae Philosophandi</i> to Sanderson\xE2\x80\x99s Logicae <i>artis compendium</i> and takes the (quite tenuous) similarity between the two sets of rules to indicate that Newton conceived of the study of scripture and nature as falling under a common methodology. The final two essays of the volume consider Newton\xE2\x80\x99s disputes with Leibniz. Hall provides a concise account of how an initially cordial correspondence turned into a full-blown priority dispute regarding the invention of the calculus, partially due to the actions of Fatio de Duillier, Keill, and other intermediaries. In the brief final essay, Domenico Bertoloni-Meli emphasizes two aspects of the context of the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence that are typically neglected: first, Caroline\xE2\x80\x99s role as mediator, and second, the primacy of the theological issues at play in the debate.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>On the whole, we recommend the <i>Companion</i> to both scholars and newcomers, even though it presents an image of Newton based on traditional historiography. The <i>Companion</i>\xE2\x80\x99s greatest shortcoming lies in its failure to more directly address the difficulties of integrating Newton\xE2\x80\x99s various intellectual pursuits and of understanding his relationship to intellectual traditions other than those acknowledged in his published works. Nevertheless, the overall quality and originality of the essays in this volume demonstrate that substantial advances can still be made regarding both the \xE2\x80\x9Ctechnical\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cother\xE2\x80\x9D Newton. It is certain that many further advances will be launched from the ground set by the <i>Companion</i>.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

transformed_content: "<p>For over three centuries, Newtonian science has provided the backdrop for discussions of the epistemological and ontological implications of empirical science. Philosophers interested in the impact of Newtonian science on the development of philosophy thus face the daunting task of teasing the historical truth from three centuries of elaborations and myths regarding Newton and his intellectual legacy. The current volume has the explicit dual goal of peeling away a number of prevailing misconceptions and introducing Newtonian science to a philosophical audience. In both regards, it is a success. The <i>Companion</i> is bound to become a standard reference work, and it is indispensable for scholars and newcomers interested in 17th and 18th century natural philosophy. Thus it is unfortunate that the volume\xE2\x80\x99s excellent coverage of some aspects of Newton scholarship does not extend more broadly. There is a clear division between Newton\xE2\x80\x99s scientific work (roughly two thirds of the volume) and the work of the \xE2\x80\x9Cother Newton\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 the natural philosopher, theologian, and alchemist revealed through unpublished manuscripts studied over the last four decades. The <i>Companion</i> gives a clear overview of the aspects of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s work that had the greatest immediate impact on his contemporaries, at the cost of neglecting Newton\xE2\x80\x99s connections with earlier philosophical traditions that are only hinted at in his published works.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>As with other volumes in the <i>Cambridge Companion</i> series, the editors commissioned original essays (16 in total) and supplemented these with an introduction and bibliography. The essays regarding the \xE2\x80\x9Ctechnical Newton\xE2\x80\x9D reap the substantial rewards of a recent resurgence of interest in careful reconstructions of Newtonian science and methodology. Below we will follow one of the volume\xE2\x80\x99s threads- \xE2\x80\x93 concerning Newton\xE2\x80\x99s methodology and its philosophical consequences \xE2\x80\x93 through the essays of Alan Shapiro, William Harper, George Smith, Howard Stein, and Robert DiSalle. These essays carefully and convincingly demonstrate that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s methodological advances and ontological commitments must be understood in relation to his attempts to address a set of well-defined empirical concerns. However, we would like to stress that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s thinking should not be understood as addressing those concerns <i>exclusively</i>. As some of the remaining, much briefer essays concerning the \xE2\x80\x9Cother Newton\xE2\x80\x9D show, Newton saw himself not only as tackling the technical requirements of framing a new physics, but as responding to traditional philosophical and theological worries. What is missing from the <i>Companion</i> is a clear vision of how these two motivations dovetail with one another, or an argument that there was in fact little interplay between these pursuits. Niccol\xC3\xB2 Guicciardini\xE2\x80\x99s and Maurizio Mamiani\xE2\x80\x99s essays are of note in this regard, since they suggest how a reconciliation of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CJanus faces\xE2\x80\x9D may be reached.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Newton first declared that his experimental research embodied a new mode of inquiry in his early optical publications (1672-76). Critics such as Hooke rejected Newton\xE2\x80\x99s claims to have established results \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout any suspicion of doubts\xE2\x80\x9D and argued that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s results depended upon an unacknowledged hypothesis: that light consists of small corpuscles. Newton found this misconstrual of his work so infuriating that he bitterly withdrew from public discussions of natural philosophy for nearly a decade. Shapiro\xE2\x80\x99s masterful overview of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s optical research focuses on these methodological debates. Shapiro argues convincingly in Newton\xE2\x80\x99s favor regarding the early disputes: the central innovation in his theory of color, namely that white light is composed of rays of differing refrangability, does not depend upon the corpuscular hypothesis. Although Newton later used the corpuscular hypothesis to account for dispersion, refraction, and the colors of thin films, Shapiro explains that the hypothesis met with only qualitative successes and several failures. Newton was keenly aware of its limitations, and thus found his critics\xE2\x80\x99 tendency to blur the line between it and results \xE2\x80\x9Cdemonstrated by experiments\xE2\x80\x9D particularly galling. Nevertheless, Newton did not always draw such a sharp line between conjectures and certainties. In 1675 he introduced aether vibrations to account for periodic behavior he had carefully observed in his study of \xE2\x80\x9CNewton\xE2\x80\x99s rings.\xE2\x80\x9D In the <i>Opticks</i> this conjecture was transformed into \xE2\x80\x9Cfits of easy reflection and refraction\xE2\x80\x9D and presented as an established principle (p. 245). But what legitimated this elevation \xE2\x80\x93 or the elevated status of other ideas, such as the atomic theory of matter? Shapiro\xE2\x80\x99s essay ultimately raises more questions than it answers regarding the ways in which conjectures receive sufficient warrant to become established principles.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Newton\xE2\x80\x99s contemporaries and subsequent scholars have long attempted to answer these and other questions in light of the <i>Principia</i> and Newton\xE2\x80\x99s various methodological pronouncements. Smith\xE2\x80\x99s contribution draws together a number of insights regarding Newtonian methodology based on an extremely thorough reading of the <i>Principia</i>. This essay and Harper\xE2\x80\x99s line-by-line reconstruction of the argument for universal gravitation both emphasize several contrasts between Newton\xE2\x80\x99s and earlier \xE2\x80\x9Chypothetico-deductive\xE2\x80\x9D methodology. The <i>Principia</i> introduces a general mathematical theory of forces that has few (if any) direct consequences for observed phenomena without constraints provided by observations. The mathematical apparatus of Books I and II links characteristics of forces to observed features of motion, either in terms of specific parameters or general qualitative features. The theory is not tested by checking directly measurable quantities; instead, observations are used to \xE2\x80\x9Cdeduce\xE2\x80\x9D the features of postulated forces, and then the framework generates a variety of consequences of the postulated force law. Smith and Harper both stress that Newton counted agreement between independent measures of a force as significant evidence in favor of the theory. For example, the famous \xE2\x80\x9Cmoon test\xE2\x80\x9D in proposition III.4 emphasizes the precise numerical agreement between the moon\xE2\x80\x99s one-second falling distance (measured using orbital parameters) and the same distance for bodies in Paris (measured with Huygens\xE2\x80\x99 seconds pendulum). Harper\xE2\x80\x99s <i>leitmotif</i> is that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s argument for universal gravitation proceeds by showing that independent measures of \xE2\x80\x9Ccausal parameters\xE2\x80\x9D for the force of gravity converge on stable values and that this convergence constitutes empirical success.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Several other aspects of the methodology in the <i>Principia</i> are highlighted in Smith\xE2\x80\x99s rich essay, of which we will mention only the interplay between approximation and idealization. Newton clearly stated one of the obstacles to gleaning an understanding of forces from the phenomena of planetary motion: \xE2\x80\x9CBut to consider simultaneously all these causes of [planetary] motion and to define these motions by exact laws admitting of easy calculation exceeds, if I am not mistaken, the force of any human mind\xE2\x80\x9D (quoted on p. 153). Newton responded by carefully ensuring that his arguments from the phenomena hold even in the face of inexactitude. We can illustrate the idea with a simple contrast: if a planet sweeps out nearly equal areas in equal times, the force holding it in orbit is approximately centripetal (as Newton shows in corollaries to proposition I.3); however, a body can move in an approximately elliptical orbit with a force law that is not even approximately inverse square (see Smith 2002). The argument for universal gravitation relies on inferences like the former, whose consequent holds approximately if the antecedent only holds approximately. In addition, Newton clearly recognized the importance of approaching the complexities of real motions via a series of successive approximations. Briefly, Smith argues that at each stage of approximation remaining differences between observations and the \xE2\x80\x9Cexact theory\xE2\x80\x9D point the way towards further refinements. Here Smith draws on Cohen\xE2\x80\x99s earlier work on the \xE2\x80\x9CNewtonian Style\xE2\x80\x9D but adds considerable sophistication: the successive approximations are not just a matter of ensuring mathematical tractability; they also allow one to bring further evidence to bear on the theory. As Curtis Wilson\xE2\x80\x99s essay shows in detail, Newton\xE2\x80\x99s various proposals in Book III for extending gravitational theory inspired a long process of refinement and reformulation throughout the 18th and 19th centuries that <i>eventually</i> led to satisfactory accounts of lunar motion, the inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn, etc. Smith rightly emphasizes this often unappreciated, progressive aspect of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s methodology: the framework of the <i>Principia</i> provided fruitful ways of using evidence to refine theory well into the 20th century.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>To their credit, these essays clearly rebut quick dismissals of the \xE2\x80\x9Cmad Newtonian methodology\xE2\x80\x9D of deduction from the phenomena as a \xE2\x80\x9Cjoke\xE2\x80\x9D (to quote Lakatos), dismissals that were prevalent among philosophers of science a generation ago. However, both Harper and Smith tend towards an unabashedly modern reading of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s methodology, drawing on recent work in philosophy of science. Although both essays amply illustrate the fruits of this approach, their utility for historians of philosophy and science are less clear. For example, Harper\xE2\x80\x99s claim that \xE2\x80\x9Cthose qualities of bodies that cannot be intended or remitted [Newton\xE2\x80\x99s criterion in the third rule of philosophizing] are those that count as constant parameter values\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 188) throws doubt on the adequacy of Harper\xE2\x80\x99s notion of \xE2\x80\x9Cparameter value.\xE2\x80\x9D Is the quality of \xE2\x80\x9Csolidity\xE2\x80\x9D to be taken as a parameter value? Generally, Harper interprets the <i>Regul\xC3\xA6 Philosophandi</i> as \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing backed by an ideal of empirical success\xE2\x80\x9D as defined by him (p.185), thereby neglecting the literature (such as Maurizio Mamiani\xE2\x80\x99s essay in the present volume) on their conceptual genealogy and the metaphysics that, in Newton\xE2\x80\x99s eyes, backed their usefulness as methodological rules (see also McGuire 1970). The <i>Companion</i> overlooks existing literature on several similar issues. I. B. Cohen\xE2\x80\x99s essay introduces Newton\xE2\x80\x99s concepts of force and mass through a discussion of the definitions and laws of motion at the opening of the <i>Principia</i>. At the end of a brief discussion of <i>vis insita</i> and <i>vis inertia</i> (introduced in Definitions 3 and 4), Cohen remarks that \xE2\x80\x9CNewton never explained why he wrote of a <i>vis inertiae</i>, a \xE2\x80\x98force of inertia,\xE2\x80\x99 rather than a property of inertia and we have no basis for guessing what was his state of mind\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 62). While it is true that from a modern point of view Newton\xE2\x80\x99s language is extremely puzzling, other commentators have argued that it reflects his indebtedness to Aristotelian thought and to the associated ontology that regards <i>vis insita</i> as an internal causal principle that generates inertial motion rather than treating it as an uncaused \xE2\x80\x9Cstate of motion\xE2\x80\x9D (see McGuire 1994, McMullin 1978).</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Guicciardini\xE2\x80\x99s essay successfully demonstrates how sensitivity to the conceptual milieu of the 17th century can be fruitfully combined with attention to technical detail. By 1671 Newton had developed the methods of fluxional analysis to such a degree that he outstripped all his contemporaries, but rather than publish his work Newton came to doubt the value of the symbolic techniques he had so thoroughly mastered. Guicciardini situates Newton\xE2\x80\x99s developing preference for a \xE2\x80\x9Cgeometrical style\xE2\x80\x9D against the backdrop of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s own admiration of ancient knowledge and the broader \xE2\x80\x9Cgeometrical backlash\xE2\x80\x9D against algebraic methods represented by Barrow and Hobbes. Newton\xE2\x80\x99s preference for a geometrical style had a remarkable impact on his later work, including the \xE2\x80\x9Csynthetic account of fluxions\xE2\x80\x9D given in the <i>Geometria Curvilinea</i> and, most notably, the mathematical methods used in the <i>Principia</i>. We hope this essay will inspire similar research into Newton\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy of mathematics, a topic that has too often taken a back seat to investigations of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s natural philosophy.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>In the <i>Companion\xE2\x80\x99s</i> longest contribution and its centerpiece, Stein develops an account of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysics rich in philosophical context. Motivated by a careful reading of an unpublished manuscript known as \xE2\x80\x9CDe Grav,\xE2\x80\x9D Stein focuses on Newton\xE2\x80\x99s strikingly original conceptions of space, body, and force and illustrates how Newton\xE2\x80\x99s ontological claims grew out of a need to adequately define the basic concepts of his physics. One of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s main philosophical innovations, as Stein makes admirably clear, was to make metaphysics beholden to the findings of physics, thereby inverting the tree of knowledge as conceived by his contemporaries, notably Descartes. This emphasis on the . <i>posteriori</i> nature of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s reasoning is one of the overarching philosophical morals of the <i>Companion</i>. Stein supports this general thesis by showing how Newton\xE2\x80\x99s concepts of motion, space, and body were defined in relation to the findings of the senses, not a set of . <i>priori</i> principles. Stein stresses that Newton develops an account of body as \xE2\x80\x9Cmoving regions of impenetrability\xE2\x80\x9D that is meant to be <i>sufficient</i> to account for experience, while rejecting a Lockean demand for a deeper understanding of the <i>necessity</i> of this account of the constitution of matter. Stein characterizes this fundamental conceptual shift as one away from an emphasis on the substantial unity underlying the various attributes of matter toward a \xE2\x80\x9Cfield\xE2\x80\x9D conception: \xE2\x80\x9Cin creating a body, God (or in the \xE2\x80\x9Cconstitution\xE2\x80\x9D of a body, <i>nature</i>) must impose, not only the field of impenetrability and the laws of motion appropriate thereto, but other fields as well, with their laws, characterizing forces of interaction \xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D (pp. 288-89). The nature of the laws of motion and their relation to matter has been a recurring theme in Newton scholarship, and Stein\xE2\x80\x99s essay is certainly an important contribution to these ongoing debates.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Throughout his essay Stein advocates a reading of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysics that downplays the relevance of his theological views; he comments that studies linking Newton\xE2\x80\x99s ontology to his theological views are \xE2\x80\x9Cat variance with <i>at least</i> the epistemological side of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s own metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 297, f.n. 17, emphasis added). The emanative nature of space as presented in \xE2\x80\x9CDe Grav\xE2\x80\x9D is taken as a case in point (pp. 267-272). According to Stein, Newton urges that space be understood as a logical consequence of the existence of God or <i>any other</i> being, not a causal effect conditional on His essence. Consequently, deliberations regarding the essence of God are unnecessary for understanding the nature of space; as Newton puts it: \xE2\x80\x9Cwe have an absolute Idea of [extension] without any relationship to God\xE2\x80\x9D (p.271). Stein is in agreement here with existing literature on the subject. Other commentators have defended a similar claim, namely that space is a transcendental condition for <i>any</i> existent and is thus not dependent on God\xE2\x80\x99s particular essence (see McGuire (1990) and Carriero (1990)). However, from the thesis that <i>according to Newton</i> the content of the idea of space does not depend on the content of the idea of God, Stein draws the conclusion that Newton\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysics of space is independent from his theology. Although the antecedent is unproblematic, the consequent, which is embodied in Stein\xE2\x80\x99s denial of the claim that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe basic conceptions of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s natural philosophy, most especially his conception of space and time, [are] derivative from, or grounded in, this theology\xE2\x80\x9D (quote from McGuire on p.297, f.n. 17) does not follow. We would like to stress this point, at the risk of sounding overly critical of Stein\xE2\x80\x99s fine essay, in response to a general inclination of many of the essays in the <i>Companion</i> to emphasize Newton\xE2\x80\x99s scientific acumen while underestimating his concern with traditional philosophical debates regarding method and ontology.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Alan Gabbey\xE2\x80\x99s essay on Newton\xE2\x80\x99s relation to the mechanical philosophy stands out as going against this general trend. Regarding the current topic, Gabbey argues that in \xE2\x80\x9CDe Grav\xE2\x80\x9D Newton rejects the Cartesian conception of <i>res extensa</i> in favor of an emanationist view of space to preclude the possibility of understanding the existence of body without reference to an act of God, as well as to account for the possibility of a coherent mind-body union. Gabbey\xE2\x80\x99s meandering essay describes the disciplinary context of 17th-century natural philosophy, mathematics, and metaphysics and argues that although Newton is primarily a natural philosopher and mathematician, he also addressed metaphysical problems. While it is unclear how Newton himself conceived the relationship of his research to these problems, Gabbey stresses that \xE2\x80\x9Cthere are metaphysical aspects of his natural philosophy that are crucial to an adequate understanding of\xE2\x80\xA6 his engagement with the mechanical philosophy, and\xE2\x80\xA6 his account of the causal interventions of mind and soul in the physical world\xE2\x80\x9D (p.333). On the first count, Gabbey notes that Newton advocated explanations using non-material agents whose actions did not proceed with the type of \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical necessity\xE2\x80\x9D required by the likes of Boyle, Descartes, and Gassendi. On the second, he shows how Newton\xE2\x80\x99s belief that an act of human will can create corporeal motions\xE2\x80\x94possibly violating the 3rd law of motion\xE2\x80\x94colors much of his analysis of space and body. In either case, Gabbey makes amply clear how Newton\xE2\x80\x99s metaphysical views bore directly on his natural philosophy. Likewise, the essays of Carriero and McGuire cited above demonstrate that Newton was concerned with harmonizing his theory of space with traditional theological concerns regarding God\xE2\x80\x99s essence, His causal efficacy, and His being in the world.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s essay on the status of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cdefinitions\xE2\x80\x9D of space and time complements Stein\xE2\x80\x99s piece by elucidating the way in which these notions were <i>required</i> by Newtonian physics. Reichenbach once characterized Newton\xE2\x80\x99s absolute space and time as a \xE2\x80\x9Cmystical philosophical superstructure,\xE2\x80\x9D to be criticized on the broadly philosophical grounds suggested by Leibniz, Mach and Einstein. DiSalle follows recent work in philosophy of space and time in rejecting this view, and developing in its place an \xE2\x80\x9Cempiricist\xE2\x80\x9D account that emphasizes the empirical content acquired by the ideas of space and time within the framework of Newtonian physics. On this account, Newton\xE2\x80\x99s main concern in the famous scholium following the laws is <i>not</i> a proof of the existence of absolute space, but rather an assessment of the definitions of space and time already <i>implicit</i> in dynamical reasoning about motion and its causes by Newton and his contemporaries. The scholium presents a series of arguments to the effect that various properties of motion cannot be analyzed in terms of relative time and space. (See, in particular, Rynasiewicz 1995 for a careful reading of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s scholium complementary to DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s essay.) Newton\xE2\x80\x99s main target here, as in the \xE2\x80\x9CDe Grav,\xE2\x80\x9D is Descartes, and his attempt to combine a dynamics attributing a unique state of motion or rest to bodies with a relational account of motion that cannot underwrite such a distinction. As DiSalle explains, in response Newton introduced more structure than his physics actually required: the distinction between accelerated and uniform motion is crucial to identifying forces, but the attribution of forces does not, as Newton thought, differentiate between states of motion with respect to absolute space (pp. 40-42). Newton did not introduce \xE2\x80\x9Cfictitious forces\xE2\x80\x9D that are <i>caused</i> by motion with respect to absolute space; rather, forces and inertial effects <i>define</i> true motions, in the sense of providing empirical criteria for determining a body\xE2\x80\x99s true state of motion within the framework of the <i>Principia</i>. However, we are not convinced that this emphasis on the definitional nature of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s claims regarding space and time will dissolve the \xE2\x80\x9Cabsolute vs. relational\xE2\x80\x9D debate entirely, as DiSalle seems to suggest. We should further remark that DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s vocabulary does not follow Newton\xE2\x80\x99s own: DiSalle often characterizes the Laws as defining \xE2\x80\x9Cspace,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Ctime,\xE2\x80\x9D and even \xE2\x80\x9Cimpressed force\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 45), which is at odds with the <i>Principia</i>\xE2\x80\x99s explicit separation between the Laws, Definitions, and consequences of both conjointly. But we are only pointing out a missed opportunity: attention to this point would have aided DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s overall argument. In any case, DiSalle\xE2\x80\x99s essay is a lucid reconstruction of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of space and time.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Two of the remaining essays include more technical detail than the rest of the volume, and are probably less suitable for the intended audience of the <i>Companion</i>. Bruce Brackenridge and Michael Nauenberg give a concise account of their recent work regarding Newton\xE2\x80\x99s use of curvature as a measure of force. This essay advocates a major change in the understanding of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s development of the concept of force and the appropriate mathematical tools for studying dynamics. According to Brackenridge and Nauenberg, curvature played a decisive role in generalizing the concept of force beyond the case of uniform circular motion in Newton\xE2\x80\x99s thinking from the mid 60s until the 80s. The curvature measure has been overlooked because the first edition of the <i>Principia</i> relied mainly on a geometrical measure of force, but Brackenridge and Nauenberg trace its use through early dynamical works, Newton\xE2\x80\x99s correspondence with Hooke in 1679-80, and revisions of the <i>Principia.</i> Curtis Wilson\xE2\x80\x99s contribution describes celestial mechanics before and after Newton, emphasizing the treatment of Kepler\xE2\x80\x99s so-called laws prior to the <i>Principia</i> and dispelling the common misconception that the <i>Principia</i> itself fully established the implications of universal gravitation for celestial mechanics.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>Unfortunately we do not have space to discuss the shorter essays from the last third of the volume in much detail. William Newman and Karin Figala discuss Newton\xE2\x80\x99s alchemy, emphasizing his indebtedness to a number of contemporaries and the tight connection between his matter theory and alchemical research. Together the essays total only 28 pages, providing a very brief introduction to one of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s major intellectual pursuits. Newman analyzes various texts in which Newton appeals to a Helmontian \xE2\x80\x9Cshell theory\xE2\x80\x9D of matter to explain chemical phenomena. Figala focuses on the influence of the overtly theological work of Sendivogius and the German Rosicrucian Maier on Newton\xE2\x80\x99s alchemical studies. Scott Mandelbrote\xE2\x80\x99s essay recounts the impact of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s unorthodox theological writings on debates among 18th century divines. Newton\xE2\x80\x99s growing authority in other matters did not compel the admiration of the theologians, who seemed to relish the chance to dismantle his arguments in the (posthumously published) <i>Chronology of Ancient Kingdom\xE2\x80\x99s Amended</i> (pp. 414-17). Mamiani recounts Newton\xE2\x80\x99s rules for biblical exegesis as set out in the <i>Treatise on Apocalypse</i> and their relation to dream interpretation. Newton believed that these domains could be understood through a search for correspondences between types of actions or structures, i.e., by analogy. For example, analogy can be found between the chromatic scale and the tonal scale or between the relationship of tension and tones in a string and the law of gravity. These correspondences allow Newton to find within the writings of the prophets indicators of the true structure of the universe, itself a form of God\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cwriting\xE2\x80\x9D. Mamiani traces the source of Newton\xE2\x80\x99s method for interpreting scripture as well as his <i>Regulae Philosophandi</i> to Sanderson\xE2\x80\x99s Logicae <i>artis compendium</i> and takes the (quite tenuous) similarity between the two sets of rules to indicate that Newton conceived of the study of scripture and nature as falling under a common methodology. The final two essays of the volume consider Newton\xE2\x80\x99s disputes with Leibniz. Hall provides a concise account of how an initially cordial correspondence turned into a full-blown priority dispute regarding the invention of the calculus, partially due to the actions of Fatio de Duillier, Keill, and other intermediaries. In the brief final essay, Domenico Bertoloni-Meli emphasizes two aspects of the context of the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence that are typically neglected: first, Caroline\xE2\x80\x99s role as mediator, and second, the primacy of the theological issues at play in the debate.</p>  \t\t\t \n\
  <p>On the whole, we recommend the <i>Companion</i> to both scholars and newcomers, even though it presents an image of Newton based on traditional historiography. The <i>Companion</i>\xE2\x80\x99s greatest shortcoming lies in its failure to more directly address the difficulties of integrating Newton\xE2\x80\x99s various intellectual pursuits and of understanding his relationship to intellectual traditions other than those acknowledged in his published works. Nevertheless, the overall quality and originality of the essays in this volume demonstrate that substantial advances can still be made regarding both the \xE2\x80\x9Ctechnical\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cother\xE2\x80\x9D Newton. It is certain that many further advances will be launched from the ground set by the <i>Companion</i>.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
