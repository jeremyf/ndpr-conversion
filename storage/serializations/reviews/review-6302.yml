content: "<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Frederick Beiser's <i>Hegel</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> ushers in a new series, 'Routledge Philosophers.'<span style=\"\">  </span>The list of contributing authors is a distinguished one, yet nobody will dispute Beiser's claim to belong there.<span style=\"\">   </span>From his first book -- </span><i>The Fate of Reason</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> -- on the context of Kantian critique, Beiser established a reputation which was only strengthened by a string of publications on Idealist and Romantic \"constellations\" of thought. The new book follows the series format: brief historical background, key arguments, philosophical legacy, as well as suggestions for further reading and a bibliography (all in an attractive typeface, I'll add).<span style=\"\">  </span>Beiser says that he wants to provide not so much exegesis as a comprehensive overview aimed primarily at the first-time reader.<span style=\"\">  </span>The result is in my judgment little short of a triumph. In 350 pages Beiser manages to suggest much of the sweep and challenge of Hegel's thought, in direct and straightforward prose, yet without shirking the procedural difficulties of Hegel's arguments and positions.<span style=\"\">   </span>Engaged and independent in his assessments, he adopts a manner that is the opposite of a bland encyclopedia entry. Along with the new edition of Stephen Houlgate's </span><i>Introduction to Hegel</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, this text easily becomes a first recommendation. </span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Beiser's approach is thematic rather than work by work or biographical.<span style=\"\">   </span>He begins with the philosophical context and Hegel's early ideals, then in part two examines Hegel's 'absolute idealism,' his organicist metaphysics and conception of 'spirit,' and \"the religious dimension\" in his thought (an admiring nod here to Emil Fackenheim).<span style=\"\">   </span>Part three takes up epistemological issues: the 'dialectic' in particular, along with a more exegetical chapter on intersubjectivity in the <i>Phenomenology</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (Lordship and Bondage).<span style=\"\">   </span>Part four turns to social and political philosophy, and part five concludes with the philosophy of history and Hegel's aesthetics, plus a short epilogue on \"the rise and fall of Hegelianism\" (ending in 1850, this admittedly is to give Hegel's legacy short shrift).<span style=\"\">   </span>Although comprehensive and thorough in his treatment, Beiser does omit a few things, notably the Logic and philosophy of nature.<span style=\"\">   </span>Omission may well be the one and only art, as Robert Louis Stevenson declared, but here it tends to distort.<span style=\"\">   </span>I share Beiser's expressed regret about the Logic especially, and even if there is some compensation in the few cogent pages on Hegel's dialectic in chapter 5, a separate treatment would I think have only strengthened the metaphysical interpretation that Beiser offers.</span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">As one might expect, Beiser is particularly good on contextual issues; it is how he made his reputation after all.<span style=\"\">   </span>He starts out with the \"<i>Grunds\xC3\xA4tzkritik</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\" of the 1790s, something that I imagine will be unfamiliar to all but a few specialists.<span style=\"\">   </span>Recent work by, for example, Dieter Henrich or Manfred Frank has brought out the importance of this almost forgotten episode, and its prominence in the opening chapter is welcome.<span style=\"\">   </span>Equally welcome in my view is Beiser's emphasis on the formative role played by Jena Romanticism; Hegel's hypercritical attitude towards Schlegel and company indicates how significant they were for him.<span style=\"\">   </span>Overall the contextual or 'hermeneutic' approach constitutes in fact the book's greatest virtue.<span style=\"\">   </span>At the same time it leads Beiser to slight the so-called \"analytic\" interpretation which has been instrumental in the recent Anglophone revival of Hegel's philosophy, since Findlay and others.<span style=\"\">   </span>True, attending to Wittgensteinian themes can easily seem anachronistic, or conversely sound already somewhat dated, or (Beiser's major objection) will fail to sort out Hegel's own contributions from those of his peers.<span style=\"\">  </span>Yet to rule out of court such recent linguistic interpretations as, e.g., Brandom's (he receives merely bibliographic mention) will to some look a bit purist.<span style=\"\">   </span>It is of a piece with the other chief strategy Beiser champions, that is, a resolutely metaphysical take on Hegel.<span style=\"\">   </span>He rebuts the 'non-metaphysical' Hegel who has figured so large in his North American reception, not least under the influence of Klaus Hartmann's students.</span><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">1</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\">   </span>Nailing his own colors to the mast, Beiser declares that Hegel was a metaphysician through and through, albeit in a post-Kantian universe, and that we sell his views and arguments short if we don't factor that into our interpretations.<span style=\"\">   </span>Contrasting strategies -- Hartmann's 'categorial' line, Pippin's 'neo-Kantianism,' Pinkard's 'social epistemology,' not to mention humanist, existentialist, or other preferences -- are dismissed in a footnote or two, if they get even that.<span style=\"\">   </span>In their stead we get a powerful reading of the various parts of Hegel's system in a metaphysical light.<span style=\"\">   </span>Dialectic for example is rendered as comprising both a dualist ontology and its self-dissolution into a speculative monism -- which I think does justice to Hegel's Janus-faced Logic, even though I should have liked more on Hegelian 'negation,' or how the triad universal/particular/singular functions within the system as a whole.<span style=\"\">   </span>And other chapters are just as penetrating; on 'spirit,' say, or on Hegel's philosophy of religion, where Beiser manages to give a clear and balanced account of Hegel's critique of salvational myth (consistent with his 'immanent' conception of God) and his qualified endorsement of Lutheranism in the Berlin context.<span style=\"\">   </span>Or again, the sections on Hegel's social and political thought and his theory of the state benefit from a quasi-Aristotelian interpretation stressing a teleology less in nature itself as in the human will embedded in historical context.<span style=\"\">   </span>Beiser concludes: \"Ultimately, Hegel's normative doctrine was original, profound and coherent.<span style=\"\">  </span>In a remarkable fashion it fused the rationalist, voluntarist and historicist traditions, preserving their truths and canceling their errors\" (212).<span style=\"\">   </span>That gives a fair impression of the author's briskly reconciling attitude.<span style=\"\">   </span>One should add that Beiser has the grace also to admit that Hegel's grand synthesis is often clearer in its aims than in its achieved result.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">I have reservations about a few things, for example, the treatments of intersubjectivity (chapter 8) and aesthetics (chapter 12).<span style=\"\">   </span>Beiser tells us that he had shelved early ambitions to write a commentary on Hegel's <i>Phenomenology</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> when he learned of H.S. Harris's \"similar project, which finally bore such marvelous fruit in </span><i>Hegel's Ladder</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\" (xii), published in 1997.<span style=\"\">   </span>It is unfortunate that his own treatment of \"Lordship and Bondage\" largely ignores Harris,</span><sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">2</span></span></span></a></sup> along with much other scholarship.<span style=\"\">   </span>In fairness that is because, hewing to a strong 'metaphysical' line, he grounds his own argument on what he sees as the proper context of <i>Phenomenology</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> Chapter IV: the circular ontology-cum-epistemology -- the 'I = I' -- of Fichte's </span><i>Wissenschaftslehre </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">and the threat of \"nihilism\" that hovers over it.<span style=\"\">   </span>While broadly justified, this is to overlook Fichte's role in supplying the very term \"recognition\" (</span><i>Anerkennung</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) that figures as key to the narrative (the \"dialectic of experience\") Hegel proceeds to tell.<span style=\"\">  </span>Beiser notes that many commentators assume that sociality exists from the start rather than seeing it as precisely what is to be won.<span style=\"\">  </span>Writing of </span><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\xC2\xA7175 and its claim that \"[s]elf-consciousness achieves its satisfaction only in another self-consciousness,\" Beiser correctly takes this to be from \"our\" (he calls it the \"philosopher's\") viewpoint, not for the agent itself, which will have to </span><i>earn</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> the right to such a claim in the dialectical adventures starting with the battle for recognition and continuing through Chapter V (\"Reason\").<span style=\"\">   </span>In my view the dialectic of IVa is most plausibly taken as that of a single consciousness finding that in order to make good its claim to self-awareness and self-satisfaction in the world at large it must be conceptually prepared to recognize otherness, an other equal to itself; there need actually be another person involved.<span style=\"\">  </span>The battle rages </span><i>within</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that consciousness, and it is for self-domination or self-enslavement.<span style=\"\">   </span>Beiser tends to psychologize the battle, to speak about \"respect\" for another's \"desires\" or for its \"status\" as a human being.<span style=\"\">  </span>And he is quite wrong to speak of the \"liberation\" of the slave, who quite </span><i>fails</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to recognize himself in the products of his labor (otherwise the ensuing dialectic would be much shorter!).<span style=\"\">  </span>Beiser concludes that \"it is a </span><i>moral</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> rather than a </span><i>metaphysical</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> refutation of nihilism\" (191) -- which among other things ignores the moments of labor (I express myself in my own </span><i>work</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">), of service, and of fear and trembling.<span style=\"\">   </span></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">As for Hegel's philosophy of art, while Beiser justly remarks on its relative neglect in the literature, he fails to take note of much recent work, especially Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert's studies of the various lecture series (the scholarly problems are almost intractable, more so than with say the philosophy of religion).<span style=\"\">   </span>The famous definition of beauty as \"the sensuous <i>Scheinen</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of the Idea\" is found in no extant lecture notes, although one can make the case for the centrality of Hegel's argument that essence must \"shine\" and appear.<span style=\"\">  </span>Again, while Beiser is right to mention Hegel's debt to Romanticism, the reference to his \"uncompromising classicism\" is a canard: Hegel was much more interested in the \"symbolical\" world-view prior to the classical Ideal and in the \"romantic\" world-view devolving from it, and even with the Ideal he dwells on its internal contradictions.<span style=\"\">   </span>And although Beiser notes Hegel's love of opera and art galleries, he fails to ask -- with Gethmann-Siefert -- what that might suggest about Hegel's attitude to contemporary art as a social if no longer religious practice (concert hall, museum, world-literature, etc.).<span style=\"\">   </span></span></p>    <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">It would be unfair to end on a note of complaint, however, when so much of the book is outstanding.<span style=\"\">  </span>Beiser may or may not be justified in concluding (313) that the owl of Minerva has flown from her roost over Hegel's grave, but something of the spirit of Hegel lives on in this book.\r\n\
