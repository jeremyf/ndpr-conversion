style=\"\">  </span>Instead of giving equal weight to each section of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique\xE2\x80\x9D Wenzel gives considerable priority to the discussion of the four

to many scholars.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is a common interpretation of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique\xE2\x80\x9D to see the argument in the Deduction as merely repeating the argument already made in

readers. <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">There are some other interpretative choices which Wenzel makes and which, perhaps, he also should have better explained to the reader.<span style=\"\">  </span>Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetic theory is often thought to be a kind of formalism, i.e. that our appreciation of beauty is to be concerned with the very way in which elements are arranged, not the nature of the elements themselves.<span style=\"\">  </span>To be sure Kant talks this way and sometimes seems to think that this position follows from his key notion of a free harmony (or as Wenzel prefers a \xE2\x80\x9Cfree play\xE2\x80\x9D) of the imagination and the understanding.<span style=\"\">  </span>However, in recent scholarship it has been argued that such a strict kind of formalism does not follow from the free harmony criteria.<span style=\"\">  </span>For example, it has been argued that beauty as the expression of aesthetic ideas, a doctrine developed in the latter sections of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique\xE2\x80\x9D and to which Wenzel devotes little space, is at the very least consistent with the free harmony requirement (Paul Guyer has argued such a position).<span style=\"\">  </span>If this is a correct interpretation of Kant, and I think that it is, it very much complicates the story of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s commitment to formalism.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">By his own admission, Wenzel engages in a few \xE2\x80\x9Cdigressions\xE2\x80\x9D along the way in his description of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique of Aesthetic Judgment.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>Prior to his analysis of the four moments of the Anayltic, he has a discussion of the notion of a \xE2\x80\x9Cmoment\xE2\x80\x9D in general including its present and past scientific uses.<span style=\"\">  </span>This discussion is interesting and well informed due to Wenzel's background in Mathematics.<span style=\"\">  </span>However given the compact nature of this book it may not have been the wisest use of limited space.<span style=\"\">  </span>The same can be said of his \xE2\x80\x9Cside issue\xE2\x80\x9D discussion of Transcendental Logic within the analysis of the second moment of the Analytic.<span style=\"\">  </span>While well done in its own right, it is not clear that this discussion is terribly relevant to an understanding of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique of Aesthetic Judgment.\xE2\x80\x9D<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">As mentioned above, although this book is intended to give students a more or less straightforward explication of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s position in the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique,\xE2\x80\x9D Wenzel allows himself a final chapter in which he raises some objections to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s position -- chapter 7 entitled \xE2\x80\x9CTwo Challenges.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>One might question whether this is appropriate in an introductory text or whether it crosses the line toward a more scholarly work.<span style=\"\">  </span>I would defend Wenzel's choice to include some critical discussions.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is quite appropriate, even in an introductory book, to evaluate the ultimate success of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s project.<span style=\"\">  </span>However, I would question the specific \xE2\x80\x9Cchallenges\xE2\x80\x9D that Wenzel addresses.<span style=\"\">  </span>The two problems that he discusses are the extent to which Kant\xE2\x80\x99s account can have a place for objects that are \xE2\x80\x9Cugly\xE2\x80\x9D -- which is to say objects that should be judged aesthetically negative -- and whether there can be Beauty and Genius in Mathematics.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">The fist issue, for which there has been some discussion in the literature (including an article by Wenzel) is the following.<span style=\"\">  </span>If Kant\xE2\x80\x99s criteria for \xE2\x80\x9Cbeauty\xE2\x80\x9D (aesthetic goodness) is that an object is beautiful if and only if its appreciation engages in us a free harmony of the cognitive faculties, then one might think that to judge an object to be \xE2\x80\x9Cugly\xE2\x80\x9D would be to say that it does not engage such a harmony.<span style=\"\">  </span>However, Wenzel wants to say that not engaging free harmony may well explain why we would make a judgment of \xE2\x80\x9Cnot beautiful\xE2\x80\x9D but this is quite different from judging something to be positively \xE2\x80\x9Cugly.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">    </span>He argues that in order for Kant to have an account of the \xE2\x80\x9Cugly\xE2\x80\x9D he needs to talk about a \xE2\x80\x9Cdisharmonious\xE2\x80\x9D play of the faculties.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel further argues that while Kant does not explicitly hold such a position, it is consistent with the rest of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theory.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">The second \xE2\x80\x9Cchallenge\xE2\x80\x9D that Wenzel considers is that of the possibility of Beauty and Genius in Mathematics -- again, a topic on which he has already published and in which he, as a mathematician, is particularly interested.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel wonders whether Kant\xE2\x80\x99s account of beauty can be extended to find room for the aesthetic appreciation of<span style=\"\">  </span>mathematics (for example, taking aesthetic pleasure in constructing proofs for theorems or even in creating a mathematical system).<span style=\"\">  </span>Could mathematics be considered an area for genius (surely we use the term this way) to create something of beauty?<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel argues that, with a little effort, we can apply a notion like free harmony of the imagination and understanding to the project of mathematics -- particularly in the more creative enterprises of mathematics.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">The \xE2\x80\x9Cchallenges\xE2\x80\x9D raised in the above two cases and Wenzel\xE2\x80\x99s defense of them are very nicely done; however, one can question the relative importance of these two issues.<span style=\"\">  </span>I would think that there are several problem areas in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics that deserve more attention than the two Wenzel chooses.<span style=\"\">  </span>I shall mention only a couple such issues here.<span style=\"\">  </span>The central argument of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\xE2\x80\x9D is the justification of the subjective universal validity of judgments of taste.<span style=\"\">  </span>The interpretation of this central argument is controversial for a number of reasons.<span style=\"\">  </span>First, it is not altogether clear where this argument occurs or what elements it uses.<span style=\"\">  </span>Some commentators believe that the entire argument is completed in the \xE2\x80\x9CAnalytic of the Beautiful,\xE2\x80\x9D particularly paragraphs 9 and 21.<span style=\"\">  </span>Others, like Henry Allison, believe that Kant also requires the official \xE2\x80\x9CDeduction\xE2\x80\x9D given in paragraph 38.<span style=\"\">  </span>Still others believe that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s argument to universal validity requires the connection with morality argued for largely in the \xE2\x80\x9CDialectic.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>Yet, not only is there controversy about what are the elements of the argument but, naturally enough, there is further controversy over the ultimate success of any version of this argument.<span style=\"\">  </span>Unfortunately, Wenzel does not spend sufficient time on this issue.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"><span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">Another central issue that gets short shrift in Wenzel\xE2\x80\x99s book is the notion of a free harmony<span style=\"\">  </span>of the imagination and understanding.<span style=\"\">  </span>Many scholars have noted that there is something deeply paradoxical about this notion.<span style=\"\">  </span>Kant holds that aesthetic appreciation is a matter of finding a manifold of sense perception in conformity with the rule-orderly function of the understanding -- more simply, aesthetic appreciation is a matter of finding orderliness in a given set of sense perceptions.<span style=\"\">  </span>This seems straightforward enough.<span style=\"\">  </span>However, Kant also holds that we are to find this rule-orderliness somehow without discerning or applying any sort of rules (free from rules).<span style=\"\">  </span>It is far from clear how or if this can be done.<span style=\"\">  </span>Since free harmony plays such a central role in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics, it is quite important to explain how to make sense of such a paradoxical notion.<span style=\"\">  </span>Again, one would have wished that Wenzel had paid a bit more attention to this issue. <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">Despite my quibbles, there is a lot to recommend this book.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel brings an interesting perspective to the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique of Aesthetic Judgment.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel is German and there are few studies of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique\xE2\x80\x9D written originally in English by a German.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel is also a mathematician and this training informs both his discussions of the \xE2\x80\x9CMoments\xE2\x80\x9D of the Analytic and the concern with whether mathematics can be beautiful.<span style=\"\">  </span>Further, Wenzel, more than most commentators, is quite good at giving actual aesthetic examples to help illustrate his understanding of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s position.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p> Wenzel also brings a considerable knowledge of the history of thought, philosophical and otherwise, as background to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s position on Aesthetics.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is particularly apparent in his discussion of the \xE2\x80\x9Csensus communis\xE2\x80\x9D in the fourth moment.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is quite helpful to see how the idea of sensus communis was being used at the time to better understand the point that Kant is making in this portion of the text.<span style=\"\">  </span>Similarly, the discussion under the heading of \xE2\x80\x9CHow to Read Section 9\" (of the Second Moment) is very well done.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel takes one of the most difficult sections of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique\xE2\x80\x9D and gives the reader a fairly clear sense of what Kant is up to here.<span style=\"\">  </span>Finally, it should be mentioned that Wenzel\xE2\x80\x99s book has a very nice Forward by Henry Allison.<span style=\"\">  </span>Allison\xE2\x80\x99s consenting to write a Forward is evidence of the high quality of this book.<span style=\"\">  </span>In sum, I highly recommend this book to students and scholars with some familiarity with Kant and the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique of Aesthetic Judgment.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>This book will surely deepen their understanding of Kant."

Judgment.\xE2\x80\x9D<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">As mentioned above, although this book is intended to give students a more or less straightforward explication of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s position in the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique,\xE2\x80\x9D Wenzel allows himself a final chapter in which he raises some objections to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s position -- chapter 7 entitled \xE2\x80\x9CTwo Challenges.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>One might question whether this is appropriate in an introductory text or whether it crosses the line toward a more scholarly work.<span style=\"\">  </span>I would defend Wenzel's choice to include some critical discussions.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is quite appropriate, even in an introductory book, to evaluate the ultimate success of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s project.<span style=\"\">  </span>However, I would question the specific \xE2\x80\x9Cchallenges\xE2\x80\x9D that Wenzel addresses.<span style=\"\">  </span>The two problems that he discusses are the extent to which Kant\xE2\x80\x99s account can have a place for objects that are \xE2\x80\x9Cugly\xE2\x80\x9D -- which is to say objects that should be judged aesthetically negative -- and whether there can be Beauty and Genius in Mathematics.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">The fist issue, for which there has been some discussion in the literature (including an article by Wenzel) is the following.<span style=\"\">  </span>If Kant\xE2\x80\x99s criteria for \xE2\x80\x9Cbeauty\xE2\x80\x9D (aesthetic goodness) is that an object is beautiful if and only if its appreciation engages in us a free harmony of the cognitive faculties, then one might think that to judge an object to be \xE2\x80\x9Cugly\xE2\x80\x9D would be to say that it does not engage such a harmony.<span style=\"\">  </span>However, Wenzel wants to say that not engaging free harmony may well explain why we would make a judgment of \xE2\x80\x9Cnot beautiful\xE2\x80\x9D but this is quite different from judging something to be positively \xE2\x80\x9Cugly.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">    </span>He argues that in order for Kant to have an account of the \xE2\x80\x9Cugly\xE2\x80\x9D he needs to talk about a \xE2\x80\x9Cdisharmonious\xE2\x80\x9D play of the faculties.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel further argues that while Kant does not explicitly hold such a position, it is consistent with the rest of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theory.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">The second \xE2\x80\x9Cchallenge\xE2\x80\x9D that Wenzel considers is that of the possibility of Beauty and Genius in Mathematics -- again, a topic on which he has already published and in which he, as a mathematician, is particularly interested.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel wonders whether Kant\xE2\x80\x99s account of beauty can be extended to find room for the aesthetic appreciation of<span style=\"\">  </span>mathematics (for example, taking aesthetic pleasure in constructing proofs for theorems or even in creating a mathematical system).<span style=\"\">  </span>Could mathematics be considered an area for genius (surely we use the term this way) to create something of beauty?<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel argues that, with a little effort, we can apply a notion like free harmony of the imagination and understanding to the project of mathematics -- particularly in the more creative enterprises of mathematics.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">The \xE2\x80\x9Cchallenges\xE2\x80\x9D raised in the above two cases and Wenzel\xE2\x80\x99s defense of them are very nicely done; however, one can question the relative importance of these two issues.<span style=\"\">  </span>I would think that there are several problem areas in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics that deserve more attention than the two Wenzel chooses.<span style=\"\">  </span>I shall mention only a couple such issues here.<span style=\"\">  </span>The central argument of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\xE2\x80\x9D is the justification of the subjective universal validity of judgments of taste.<span style=\"\">  </span>The interpretation of this central argument is controversial for a number of reasons.<span style=\"\">  </span>First, it is not altogether clear where this argument occurs or what elements it uses.<span style=\"\">  </span>Some commentators believe that the entire argument is completed in the \xE2\x80\x9CAnalytic of the Beautiful,\xE2\x80\x9D particularly paragraphs 9 and 21.<span style=\"\">  </span>Others, like Henry Allison, believe that Kant also requires the official \xE2\x80\x9CDeduction\xE2\x80\x9D given in paragraph 38.<span style=\"\">  </span>Still others believe that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s argument to universal validity requires the connection with morality argued for largely in the \xE2\x80\x9CDialectic.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>Yet, not only is there controversy about what are the elements of the argument but, naturally enough, there is further controversy over the ultimate success of any version of this argument.<span style=\"\">  </span>Unfortunately, Wenzel does not spend sufficient time on this issue.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"><span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">Another central issue that gets short shrift in Wenzel\xE2\x80\x99s book is the notion of a free harmony<span style=\"\">  </span>of the imagination and understanding.<span style=\"\">  </span>Many scholars have noted that there is something deeply paradoxical about this notion.<span style=\"\">  </span>Kant holds that aesthetic appreciation is a matter of finding a manifold of sense perception in conformity with the rule-orderly function of the understanding -- more simply, aesthetic appreciation is a matter of finding orderliness in a given set of sense perceptions.<span style=\"\">  </span>This seems straightforward enough.<span style=\"\">  </span>However, Kant also holds that we are to find this rule-orderliness somehow without discerning or applying any sort of rules (free from rules).<span style=\"\">  </span>It is far from clear how or if this can be done.<span style=\"\">  </span>Since free harmony plays such a central role in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetics, it is quite important to explain how to make sense of such a paradoxical notion.<span style=\"\">  </span>Again, one would have wished that Wenzel had paid a bit more attention to this issue. <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">Despite my quibbles, there is a lot to recommend this book.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel brings an interesting perspective to the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique of Aesthetic Judgment.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel is German and there are few studies of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique\xE2\x80\x9D written originally in English by a German.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel is also a mathematician and this training informs both his discussions of the \xE2\x80\x9CMoments\xE2\x80\x9D of the Analytic and the concern with whether mathematics can be beautiful.<span style=\"\">  </span>Further, Wenzel, more than most commentators, is quite good at giving actual aesthetic examples to help illustrate his understanding of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s position.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\"> <o:p></o:p></p> Wenzel also brings a considerable knowledge of the history of thought, philosophical and otherwise, as background to Kant\xE2\x80\x99s position on Aesthetics.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is particularly apparent in his discussion of the \xE2\x80\x9Csensus communis\xE2\x80\x9D in the fourth moment.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is quite helpful to see how the idea of sensus communis was being used at the time to better understand the point that Kant is making in this portion of the text.<span style=\"\">  </span>Similarly, the discussion under the heading of \xE2\x80\x9CHow to Read Section 9\" (of the Second Moment) is very well done.<span style=\"\">  </span>Wenzel takes one of the most difficult sections of the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique\xE2\x80\x9D and gives the reader a fairly clear sense of what Kant is up to here.<span style=\"\">  </span>Finally, it should be mentioned that Wenzel\xE2\x80\x99s book has a very nice Forward by Henry Allison.<span style=\"\">  </span>Allison\xE2\x80\x99s consenting to write a Forward is evidence of the high quality of this book.<span style=\"\">  </span>In sum, I highly recommend this book to students and scholars with some familiarity with Kant and the \xE2\x80\x9CCritique of Aesthetic Judgment.\xE2\x80\x9D<span style=\"\">  </span>This book will surely deepen their understanding of Kant."
