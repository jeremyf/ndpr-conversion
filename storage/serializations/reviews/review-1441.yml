content: "<p>This volume contains fifteen essays by well-established scholars addressed to various aspects of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s wide-ranging and dynamic philosophical work. It also includes a fifty-page Introduction, in which the editor sketches Russell\xE2\x80\x99s biography and surveys his philosophical development, and a fairly comprehensive Selective Bibliography, containing eight pages of works by Russell and twenty-five pages of works about Russell or his philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>In general (and with considerable overlap) the fifteen papers might helpfully be divided into five categories. First, there are three essays on Russell\xE2\x80\x99s formative influences and his relations to some important contemporaries\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9DRussell\xE2\x80\x99s Philosophical Background\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.2, by N. Griffin), \xE2\x80\x9CRussell and Moore\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.3, by R. Cartwright), and \xE2\x80\x9CRussell and Frege\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.4, by M. Beaney). Category two contains four essays addressed to Russell\xE2\x80\x99s contributions to logic and the philosophy of mathematics\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9DMathematics in and behind Russell\xE2\x80\x99s Logicism\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.1, by I. Grattan-Guinness), \xE2\x80\x9CBertrand Russell\xE2\x80\x99s Logicism\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.5, by M. Godwyn & A.D. Irvine), \xE2\x80\x9CRussell\xE2\x80\x99s Substitutional Theory\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.7, by G. Landini), and \xE2\x80\x9CThe Theory of Types\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.8, by A. Urquhart). The third division consists of two essays exclusively addressed to the parts of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s corpus that have become the most well-entrenched parts of the philosophical canon: namely, Russell\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy of language and metaphysics in the first two decades of the twentieth century\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9DThe Theory of Descriptions\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.6, by P. Hylton), and \xE2\x80\x9CThe Metaphysics of Logical Atomism\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.11, by B. Linsky). (To be sure, though, this material is touched on, in less depth, in many other essays.) Category four contains two essays on Russell\xE2\x80\x99s post-logical-atomist epistemology and metaphysics\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9DRussell\xE2\x80\x99s Neutral Monism\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.10, by R.E. Tully) and \xE2\x80\x9CRussell\xE2\x80\x99s Structuralism and the Absolute Description of the World\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.12, by W. Demopoulos). Finally, there are four retrospective overviews of some enduring aspects of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s thought\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9DRussell\xE2\x80\x99s Method of Analysis\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.9, by P. Hager) is addressed to Russell\xE2\x80\x99s philosophical methods, \xE2\x80\x9CFrom Knowledge by Acquaintance to Knowledge by Causation\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.13, by T. Baldwin) discusses the development of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s epistemology, \xE2\x80\x9CRussell, Experience, and the Roots of Science\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.14, by A.C. Grayling) is addressed to Russell\xE2\x80\x99s longstanding concern with explicating the relationship between sense experience and scientific knowledge, and \xE2\x80\x9CBertrand Russell: Moral Philosopher or Unphilosophical Moralist?\xE2\x80\x9D (Ch.15, by C. Pigden) examines Russell\xE2\x80\x99s contributions to moral philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>Although I am tempted to enter into serious critical discussions with particular authors (which is itself a testament to how engaging and controversial Russell\xE2\x80\x99s thought still is), I should not indulge this here, since the aim of this short review is to assess the volume as a whole. I set myself the more manageable aim of evaluating how well the volume measures up to two of its advertised goals: [1] for new readers, serving as the most convenient and accessible guide to Russell available, and [2] for specialists, serving as a conspectus of recent developments in Russell scholarship.</p>  \n\
  <p>There is considerable overlap not only between the five categories I just listed, but also between the individual essays. This is practically unavoidable, and, to the extent that the essays are intended to be relatively freestanding resources, this is no defect. However, this does make for laborious reading, at parts, for the specialists and zealots who will read the volume cover-to-cover. (Regardless of the quality and subtlety of the expositions, encountering the third or fourth one-paragraph exposition of the theory of descriptions, or synopsis of the logicist thesis, is prone to cause flashbacks to grading papers.)</p>  \n\
  <p>There are a number of dimensions along which the individual essays vary quite widely. Most importantly, they demand very different degrees of expertise on the part of the reader. For example, Landini\xE2\x80\x99s essay on the substitutional theory\xE2\x80\x94a pre-type-theoretic approach to the logical paradoxes that Russell developed from 1905-7\xE2\x80\x94is not for the novice, being on a relatively inaccessible topic and unavoidably containing a lot of dated formalisms. Similarly for Demopoulus\xE2\x80\x99 complex, advanced exposition of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s structuralism\xE2\x80\x94his view that we can only attain empirical knowledge of the structural aspects of physical entities, not of their intrinsic qualities. In contrast, Hylton\xE2\x80\x99s essay on the theory of descriptions, for example, is not for the specialist, being a survey from a distance of some of the most well trodden terrain in analytic philosophy. A less important contrastive dimension is broadness vs. narrowness of topic (even setting aside the uniquely massive purview of Pidgen\xE2\x80\x99s essay on all of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s social and political writings). The essays by Grayling, Linksy, and Beaney, for example, discuss various strands of logic, language, epistemology, and metaphysics, whereas the essays by Urquhart and Godwyn &amp; Irvine are sustained, focused discussions of narrower threads. Also, while some of the essays are more or less purely expository (such as those by Grattan-Guinness, Cartwright, Tully), others are arguments for controversial theses (Landini, Hager, Demopoulos, Pidgen).</p>  \n\
  <p>No doubt, some will question the choice of selections. The editor (p.46) himself laments the volume\xE2\x80\x99s relatively sketchy treatment of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s later philosophy, for example, and those who are inclined to agree with Pidgen\xE2\x80\x99s assessment that Russell is seriously underrated as a moral philosopher will feel that this aspect of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s corpus has again been slighted. For my two bits, a piece explicitly tying Russell\xE2\x80\x99s work to subsequent developments in the philosophy of language, or to the development of logical positivism, would be a welcome and worthwhile addition, as would a sustained discussion of the mutual influences between Russell\xE2\x80\x99s and Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s philosophical work. One of the essays on logicism could probably have been sacrificed, cutting down on the overlap. (If this suggestion prompts a charge of heresy, for downplaying Russell\xE2\x80\x99s contributions to logic and the philosophy of mathematics, I would plead that, while Russell\xE2\x80\x99s version of logicism is historically monumental, the enduring intrinsic importance of the specific details might just warrant one essay, not two.) Also, Hager\xE2\x80\x99s essay on Russell\xE2\x80\x99s philosophical methods struck me as not terribly useful, for either of the volume\xE2\x80\x99s intended audiences. (It is addressed to a topic that is not really on the novice\xE2\x80\x99s agenda, and arguably does not command separate treatment, from the specialist\xE2\x80\x99s point of view.) However, this is nitpicking\xE2\x80\x94on the whole, these selections are well balanced. Griffin has done an admirable job with the daunting task of deciding what most merits attention, from Russell\xE2\x80\x99s epic outpouring.</p>  \n\
  <p>(Before I am done nitpicking, though, in the part of the Selective Bibliography addressed to work that draws on or develops Russell\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy (pp.517-40), I find the selections to be capricious and sporadic. For example, some major recent discussants of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s work in the philosophy of language\xE2\x80\x94such as Donnellan, Kaplan, Kripke, Recanati, Salmon, and Soames\xE2\x80\x94are not well represented, at the expense of much less influential work that includes the word \xE2\x80\x98Russell\xE2\x80\x99 in its title. However, again, given the sheer volume of work that the editor has to sift through and rank, for this task, it is hard to be all that critical. I submit that, for any knowledgeable scholar\xE2\x80\x99s disinterested choices, with this impossible task, there are reasonable reviewers who would judge them to be capricious.)</p>  \n\
  <p>Now to explicitly address the advertised goals (i.e., [1] for new readers, serving as the most convenient and accessible guide to Russell available, and [2] for specialists, serving as a conspectus of recent developments in Russell scholarship). Well, one thing that should be pointed out with respect to goal [2] is that most of these essays are not themselves intended to be original advances in the interpretation of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy. Rather, in many cases, the essays are summaries of the author\xE2\x80\x99s recent book (cf. Grattan-Guinness (2000), Hager (1994), Landini (1998), Linsky (1999), Pidgen (1999)). So, specialists who are up to scratch on this secondary literature will already have encountered many of the ideas and theses expounded in the volume. Even so, the volume is a valuable addition to the specialist\xE2\x80\x99s home library, as it is rather handy to have collected together a good summary of important recent contributions to the interpretation of Russell\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy.</p>  \n\
  <p>As for goal [1], I have had occasion to remark on a couple of relevant criticisms. As mentioned, for example, some of these essays are a bit narrow and advanced for new readers of Russell, and there is, arguably, room for improvement in the overall balance of the coverage. However, I will certainly recommend this volume to students, from introductory to advanced, in search of secondary literature. (Even on the above point about discrepancies in the accessibility and pace of the essays, I should note that these discrepancies are not arbitrary\xE2\x80\x94in general, the most difficult essays are on topics that will only be of interest to more advanced students, while the essays on topics that will draw beginning readers tend to be more elementary.) For anyone looking for a broad, general survey of recent secondary literature on Russell, this volume is without parallel.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
