content: "<p>This book collects the proceedings of a 1999 UK Kant Society conference held in honor of Sir Peter Strawson, who is heralded by the editor (not implausibly) as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe leading proponent of analytic Kantianism.\xE2\x80\x9D Like most <i>Festschriften</i>, the book is a smorgasbord: while each of the papers has something to do with either Strawson or Kant, there are some\xE2\x80\x94such as Robert Stern\xE2\x80\x99s paper on Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s naturalism or John Hyman\xE2\x80\x99s on the causal theory of perception\xE2\x80\x94that don\xE2\x80\x99t attempt to be about both. A less wieldy but more accurate title for the book would be <i>Strawson and/or Kant</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>Still, many of the contributions hang together nicely, and two in particular (by H-J. Glock and P.M.S. Hacker) offer illuminating accounts of Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s place in the history of Kant interpretation and analytic philosophy in general. I will discuss those essays in more detail below. There are also two essays (by Eckart F\xC3\xB6rster and Henry Allison) on the third <i>Critique</i>, and two (by Tobias Rosefeldt and Maximilian de Gaynesford) on the Kantian view of the self. Another pair (by Graham Bird and Barry Stroud) compare the merits of Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cdescriptive metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D to those of traditional \xE2\x80\x9Crevisionary\xE2\x80\x9D metaphysics, taking as a focus Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s account of the synthetic . <i>priori</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s own \xE2\x80\x9CA Bit of Intellectual Autobiography\xE2\x80\x9D picks up where he left off in the <i>Library of Living Philosophers</i> volume (Hahn 1998), although in this essay he focuses more on his relationship to Kant. The method in <i>The Bounds of Sense</i>, he writes, was \xE2\x80\x9Cto preserve and present systematically what I took to be the major insights of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s work, while detaching them from those parts of the total doctrine that, if they had any substantial import at all, I took to be at best false, at worse mysterious to the point of being barely comprehensible\xE2\x80\x9D (8-9). Strawson thus happily accepts the charge, often leveled by more serious historians of philosophy, that his rational reconstructions have as much to do with twentieth-century Oxford as they do with eighteenth-century K\xC3\xB6nigsberg.</p>  \n\
  <p>The rest of Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s contribution is a pastiche (as its title suggests), ranging over his own personal history, a short critique of Rae Langton\xE2\x80\x99s recent book on the first <i>Critique</i>, and a discussion of his relationship to Wittgenstein. He includes a strikingly non-Wittgensteinian brief on behalf of both the existence of \xE2\x80\x9Cabstract intensional objects\xE2\x80\x9D (like propositions) and \xE2\x80\x9Cthe reality of subjective experience in all its richness and complexity,\xE2\x80\x9D concluding with a provocative embrace of the \xE2\x80\x9CPlatonism and Cartesianism\xE2\x80\x9D that these doctrines involve.</p>  \n\
  <p>Like Strawson, some of the other contributors take a position on the issue of appropriate methodology in Kant interpretation. Kenneth Westphal, for instance, begins by explicitly rejecting Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s approach, described as the \xE2\x80\x9Csomewhat ahistorical attempt to recruit Kant to the ranks of the analytical metaphysicians, while discarding those metaphysical elements that refused any such absorption\xE2\x80\x9D (9). Westphal retorts that Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy will only seem plausible if, \xE2\x80\x9Cinstead of incorporating Kant\xE2\x80\x99s transcendental proofs into present-day philosophical attitudes\xE2\x80\xA6[we] reconsider some of our current philosophical attitudes in order to understand and benefit from Kant\xE2\x80\x99s transcendental proofs\xE2\x80\x9D (127).</p>  \n\
  <p>In this spirit, Westphal argues that the Refutation of Idealism can succeed as an argument against external-world skepticism, but only if we first accept Kant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-Cartesian\xE2\x80\x9D picture of the mind. This requires granting that any self-conscious experience involves <i>both</i> receptivity to external objects on the part of sensibility <i>and</i> active synthesis on the part of understanding. One wonders, of course, whether presuming this substantive thesis about our cognitive psychology doesn\xE2\x80\x99t beg important questions against the skeptic and against empiricists generally. But Westphal provides some illuminating thought-experiments designed to give the thesis independent, intuitive support.</p>  \n\
  <p>Quassim Cassam\xE2\x80\x99s essay, by contrast, is classic Strawsonian (and thus revisionist) Kantianism. His stated goal is to salvage an important insight in Kant\xE2\x80\x94that we can justify some synthetic claims involving the categories without appeal to experience\xE2\x80\x94for the purposes of contemporary consumption. But in doing so he rejects as hopeless many of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s own ideas about the . <i>priori</i>, including the anti-empiricist claim that the categories are not derived from experience. My sense is that most of the contributors would side with Cassam over Westphal in preferring the Strawsonian methodology\xE2\x80\x94naturally enough in a volume honoring Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s work.</p>  \n\
  <p>Although Stroud does not continue his famous controversy with Strawson over the efficacy and scope of transcendental arguments (Stroud 1968), Thomas Grundmann and Catrin Misselhorn do. In their co-written contribution, they argue (<i>pace</i> Stroud) that some transcendental arguments <i>do</i> have the capacity to prove something about mind-independent reality, rather than merely proving something about how we must <i>conceive</i> of it. This claim is Strawsonian in spirit, even though Strawson himself has now accepted Stroud\xE2\x80\x99s criticisms and adopted a Humean-style naturalism as the metaphysical realist\xE2\x80\x99s only viable response to skepticism (Strawson 1985). Grundmann and Misselhorn\xE2\x80\x99s argument is flawed, however, by its reliance on the extraordinary premise that, \xE2\x80\x9Cnecessarily, our perceptual beliefs about the external world are largely true\xE2\x80\x9D (207). Later I will suggest that their defense of this premise\xE2\x80\x94via an externalism about content plus some overly strict rules about what it would be for a skeptical scenario to count as worrisome\xE2\x80\x94raises far more questions than it answers.</p>  \n\
  <p>As anyone familiar with these names will recognize, Glock has done a nice job of bringing together authors hailing from the three main regions of contemporary Kant scholarship (the UK, North America, and Germany), and ranging in experience from the up-and-coming to the world-famous. It is particularly significant that there are so many Germans involved, since it is often assumed that the more philologically and historically oriented scholars on the Continent turn up their collective noses at the perceived crudities of Strawson-style Kantianism. The fourteen essays together comprise a manageable 250-page volume which should be of interest to Kantians, Strawsonians, and many historians of analytic philosophy as well. In what follows, I will discuss the essays by Glock, Hacker, and Grundmann/Misselhorn in more detail.</p>  \n\
  <p>Glock\xE2\x80\x99s and Hacker\xE2\x80\x99s essays recount the well-known story of the emergence of analytic philosophy in Britain in the 20th-century, but are unique in that they highlight that tradition\xE2\x80\x99s complex and often contested relationship to Kant. The story starts with the rejection of neo-Kantianism and the Hegelianism that was its heir in Britain, a rejection that (allegedly) drove analytic philosophy to its anti-metaphysical extremes in the 20s and 30s. It culminates with the collapse of the positivist program and the return to a chastened form of speculation in the 50s and 60s, aided at least in part by Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s defense of descriptive metaphysics and his appeal to Kant as its primary forebear.</p>  \n\
  <p>Glock also releases a salvo on Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s behalf in the ongoing battle between idealist and non-idealist interpreters of Kant. The former think Kant is committed to the claim that the existence of external objects consists, at bottom, in facts about perceivers, and they appeal in support of this thought to passages in which Kant enjoins us to regard appearances \xE2\x80\x9Cas being, one and all, mere representations\xE2\x80\x9D (A369). Strawson often sounds like such an idealist interpreter, although he thinks of this as the \xE2\x80\x9Cdark side\xE2\x80\x9D of the critical philosophy, and rejects it as unworkable.</p>  \n\
  <p>On the other side are the non-idealist readers (Glock calls their view \xE2\x80\x9Cplatitudinous\xE2\x80\x9D) who insist that Kant is merely saying something about the \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemic conditions\xE2\x80\x9D under which subjects with faculties like ours can know something about mind-independent objects (29). <i>We</i> have to cognize such objects, if we are to cognize them at all, as being in spatio-temporal and causal relations, but they can also be <i>thought</i> or <i>considered</i> in abstraction from such conditions. These \xE2\x80\x9Cdouble-aspect\xE2\x80\x9D interpreters include many of Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s critics, early and late\xE2\x80\x94most notably Gerold Prauss and Henry Allison.</p>  \n\
  <p>Glock\xE2\x80\x99s taxonomy here is rather simplistic, since there are any number of middle positions and hybrids on the market (Langton\xE2\x80\x99s non-Praussian but still non-idealist interpretation is a case in point). The taxonomy aids Glock dialectically, however, since he can then suggest that Strawson has come to the rescue with a third position which is more attractive than either of its alternatives. The \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic interpretation\xE2\x80\x9D is supposed to provide a way of thinking about Kant, and especially about Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claims regarding the synthetic . <i>priori</i>, that is both historically respectable and philosophically superior.</p>  \n\
  <p>This claim is complicated, however, by the fact that \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic Kantianism\xE2\x80\x9D is used somewhat loosely in this collection. Sometimes it refers broadly to the work of those like Strawson and Bennett who seek not so much to be historical scholars but rather (in Bennett\xE2\x80\x99s words) to \xE2\x80\x9Cfight Kant \xE2\x80\x99tooth and nail\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9C as though Kant were a contemporary analytic philosopher sitting with us at the seminar-room table (19). At other times \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic Kantianism\xE2\x80\x9D is used more narrowly as a rubric covering those in the Kant industry who take Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s descriptive metaphysics to be a good model of what Kant was up to (at his best), and reconstruct his philosophy accordingly. The latter is clearly what Glock means to offer as a viable third way between idealism and platitudes.</p>  \n\
  <p>But that leads, of course, to the question of what descriptive metaphysics actually is. Strawson himself, in <i>Individuals</i>, says this: \xE2\x80\x9CDescriptive metaphysics is content to describe the actual structure of our thought about the world, revisionary metaphysics is concerned to produce a better structure\xE2\x80\x9D (9). Precisely what to make of this distinction is widely-discussed in the Strawsonian tradition, and Glock, Hacker, and Bird provide detailed accounts in their respective essays. They agree, very broadly, that descriptive metaphysics involves the attempt to describe \xE2\x80\x9Cthe most general and pervasive features of human thought about the world\xE2\x80\x9D by inquiring into our \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual scheme, the connections between the fundamental concepts we use to think about and describe the world\xE2\x80\x9D (18).</p>  \n\
  <p>If that is a fair characterization, then descriptive metaphysics is not much different from classic conceptual analysis, except that the concepts analyzed are, in Hacker\xE2\x80\x99s words, \xE2\x80\x9Chighly general, irreducible, basic, and, in a special sense, non-contingent\xE2\x80\x9D (49). Examples include \xE2\x80\x9Cexperience,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cself-consciousness,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivity,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cspace,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Ctime,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ccausation,\xE2\x80\x9D and Kant\xE2\x80\x99s identification of them as essential to our mode of cognition is praised by Glock as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe central insight of the <i>Critique</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (20). It is also noted here that most analytic Kantians agree that the way to exploit this insight is <i>not</i> to follow Kant over to the \xE2\x80\x9Cdark side\xE2\x80\x9D of genuine idealism.</p>  \n\
  <p>This last point raises the concern, however, that despite the calls in this book to renew the enterprise of descriptive metaphysics, the old Stroudian worry has not yet been put to rest. The worry is simply that realism and descriptive metaphysics make excellent bedfellows with the skeptic. For without a commitment to idealism, what grounds are there for assuming that the empirical world conforms to the fundamental categories that the descriptive metaphysicians describe? Again, even if a transcendental argument shows that <i>we must conceive</i> of the empirical world in a certain way, it seems that there will always be room for the skeptic to drive a wedge of doubt between that conception of the world, and the world <i>as it really is</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>As I noted earlier, Grundmann and Misselhorn address that problem in their essay by suggesting that we can justifiably ignore the skeptic because the scenarios he appeals to are not genuinely conceivable and thus not demonstrably possible. This is a highly controversial claim, and it rests on the assumption that for the world of a skeptical scenario to be conceivable, it must be \xE2\x80\x9Cexplanatorily coherent.\xE2\x80\x9D A scenario fails that test if it appeals to \xE2\x80\x9Cproperties that are unintelligible, mysterious, or unexplainable within this world\xE2\x80\x9D (212).</p>  \n\
  <p>But, first, why think it obvious that this constraint on conceivability holds? Can\xE2\x80\x99t a world that is conceivable in the relevant sense contain some properties that are mysterious to us? Surely we can conceive of a world in which telepathy occurs, even though the relational properties between the minds involved would be quite mysterious.</p>  \n\
  <p>There is a large debate in the background here, and no consensus on the precise sort of conceivability that is a good guide to metaphysical possibility (cf. Yablo 1993 and Gendler & Hawthorne 2002). But let\xE2\x80\x99s set that aside and suppose that we accept this constraint on the relevant sort of conceivability. It still isn\xE2\x80\x99t clear why an appeal to a Cartesian dreaming scenario or Putnam\xE2\x80\x99s brain-in-a-vat scenario fails the test. Grundmann and Misselhorn say that \xE2\x80\x9Cexplanations within other [conceivable] worlds need not follow the laws of our actual world, but there must be <i>some</i> laws that do the explanatory work within these worlds\xE2\x80\x9D (212). But in some of the nearby worlds in which we are dreaming or envatted, surely there <i>are</i> such laws. In fact, in some of those worlds the laws are presumably the same as the laws in this world (the evil scientists in the nearest vat-worlds are simply much more advanced than we are in their understanding of neurobiology). There is thus no obvious reason to think that these worlds lack explanatory coherence.</p>  \n\
  <p>A third, related point: it is unclear why Grundmann and Misselhorn think the skeptic has to accept the burden of <i>showing</i> that his scenarios are <i>metaphysically</i> possible by <i>showing</i> that they are conceivable in the relevant sense. His arguments will still have traction if he remains neutral about that, and simply highlights the <i>epistemic</i> possibility that, for all we know, the world of a skeptical scenario is both metaphysically possible and actual.</p>  \n\
  <p>Let me emphasize that the main worry here is not about whether we can have justified beliefs on the basis of what descriptive metaphysicians tell us. For if they can show that we <i>must</i> conceptualize the world in a certain way, then no doubt we are <i>justified</i> in doing so on at least some conceptions of justification. The worry is rather about whether these inevitable, permissible, and in some sense justified beliefs adequately track reality. A merely descriptive analysis of fundamental categories cannot give us any assurance that they do. Kant puts the point this way:</p>  <blockquote>If [the mind] has to conform to the constitution of the objects, then I do not see how we can know anything of them . <i>priori</i>; but if the object (as an object of the senses) conforms to the constitution of our faculty\xE2\x80\xA6, then I can very well represent this possibility to myself. (Bxvii)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>In sum: analytic Kantians (in the narrow sense) offer us nothing to put in the place of what many readers take to be Kant\xE2\x80\x99s own <i>bona fide</i> idealism, and so despite the ambitions of their transcendental arguments, they remain vulnerable to the skeptic. On this score, I think Strawson himself has done a better job at seeing the deficiencies of his early view than some of his followers.</p>  \n\
  <p>As should be clear from this discussion, there is much that is of interest in this well-executed collection. The contributions are of a very high standard, although their content is somewhat disparate. <i>Strawson and Kant</i> is a fitting tribute to the man who has contributed more than anyone else to the rehabilitation of Kant studies in Anglophone philosophy.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

  <p>On the other side are the non-idealist readers (Glock calls their view \xE2\x80\x9Cplatitudinous\xE2\x80\x9D) who insist that Kant is merely saying something about the \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemic conditions\xE2\x80\x9D under which subjects with faculties like ours can know something about mind-independent objects (29). <i>We</i> have to cognize such objects, if we are to cognize them at all, as being in spatio-temporal and causal relations, but they can also be <i>thought</i> or <i>considered</i> in abstraction from such conditions. These \xE2\x80\x9Cdouble-aspect\xE2\x80\x9D interpreters include many of Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s critics, early and late\xE2\x80\x94most notably Gerold Prauss and Henry Allison.</p>  \n\
  <p>Glock\xE2\x80\x99s taxonomy here is rather simplistic, since there are any number of middle positions and hybrids on the market (Langton\xE2\x80\x99s non-Praussian but still non-idealist interpretation is a case in point). The taxonomy aids Glock dialectically, however, since he can then suggest that Strawson has come to the rescue with a third position which is more attractive than either of its alternatives. The \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic interpretation\xE2\x80\x9D is supposed to provide a way of thinking about Kant, and especially about Kant\xE2\x80\x99s claims regarding the synthetic . <i>priori</i>, that is both historically respectable and philosophically superior.</p>  \n\
  <p>This claim is complicated, however, by the fact that \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic Kantianism\xE2\x80\x9D is used somewhat loosely in this collection. Sometimes it refers broadly to the work of those like Strawson and Bennett who seek not so much to be historical scholars but rather (in Bennett\xE2\x80\x99s words) to \xE2\x80\x9Cfight Kant \xE2\x80\x99tooth and nail\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9C as though Kant were a contemporary analytic philosopher sitting with us at the seminar-room table (19). At other times \xE2\x80\x9Canalytic Kantianism\xE2\x80\x9D is used more narrowly as a rubric covering those in the Kant industry who take Strawson\xE2\x80\x99s descriptive metaphysics to be a good model of what Kant was up to (at his best), and reconstruct his philosophy accordingly. The latter is clearly what Glock means to offer as a viable third way between idealism and platitudes.</p>  \n\
  <p>But that leads, of course, to the question of what descriptive metaphysics actually is. Strawson himself, in <i>Individuals</i>, says this: \xE2\x80\x9CDescriptive metaphysics is content to describe the actual structure of our thought about the world, revisionary metaphysics is concerned to produce a better structure\xE2\x80\x9D (9). Precisely what to make of this distinction is widely-discussed in the Strawsonian tradition, and Glock, Hacker, and Bird provide detailed accounts in their respective essays. They agree, very broadly, that descriptive metaphysics involves the attempt to describe \xE2\x80\x9Cthe most general and pervasive features of human thought about the world\xE2\x80\x9D by inquiring into our \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual scheme, the connections between the fundamental concepts we use to think about and describe the world\xE2\x80\x9D (18).</p>  \n\
  <p>If that is a fair characterization, then descriptive metaphysics is not much different from classic conceptual analysis, except that the concepts analyzed are, in Hacker\xE2\x80\x99s words, \xE2\x80\x9Chighly general, irreducible, basic, and, in a special sense, non-contingent\xE2\x80\x9D (49). Examples include \xE2\x80\x9Cexperience,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cself-consciousness,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivity,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cspace,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Ctime,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ccausation,\xE2\x80\x9D and Kant\xE2\x80\x99s identification of them as essential to our mode of cognition is praised by Glock as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe central insight of the <i>Critique</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (20). It is also noted here that most analytic Kantians agree that the way to exploit this insight is <i>not</i> to follow Kant over to the \xE2\x80\x9Cdark side\xE2\x80\x9D of genuine idealism.</p>  \n\
  <p>This last point raises the concern, however, that despite the calls in this book to renew the enterprise of descriptive metaphysics, the old Stroudian worry has not yet been put to rest. The worry is simply that realism and descriptive metaphysics make excellent bedfellows with the skeptic. For without a commitment to idealism, what grounds are there for assuming that the empirical world conforms to the fundamental categories that the descriptive metaphysicians describe? Again, even if a transcendental argument shows that <i>we must conceive</i> of the empirical world in a certain way, it seems that there will always be room for the skeptic to drive a wedge of doubt between that conception of the world, and the world <i>as it really is</i>.</p>  \n\
  <p>As I noted earlier, Grundmann and Misselhorn address that problem in their essay by suggesting that we can justifiably ignore the skeptic because the scenarios he appeals to are not genuinely conceivable and thus not demonstrably possible. This is a highly controversial claim, and it rests on the assumption that for the world of a skeptical scenario to be conceivable, it must be \xE2\x80\x9Cexplanatorily coherent.\xE2\x80\x9D A scenario fails that test if it appeals to \xE2\x80\x9Cproperties that are unintelligible, mysterious, or unexplainable within this world\xE2\x80\x9D (212).</p>  \n\
  <p>But, first, why think it obvious that this constraint on conceivability holds? Can\xE2\x80\x99t a world that is conceivable in the relevant sense contain some properties that are mysterious to us? Surely we can conceive of a world in which telepathy occurs, even though the relational properties between the minds involved would be quite mysterious.</p>  \n\
  <p>There is a large debate in the background here, and no consensus on the precise sort of conceivability that is a good guide to metaphysical possibility (cf. Yablo 1993 and Gendler & Hawthorne 2002). But let\xE2\x80\x99s set that aside and suppose that we accept this constraint on the relevant sort of conceivability. It still isn\xE2\x80\x99t clear why an appeal to a Cartesian dreaming scenario or Putnam\xE2\x80\x99s brain-in-a-vat scenario fails the test. Grundmann and Misselhorn say that \xE2\x80\x9Cexplanations within other [conceivable] worlds need not follow the laws of our actual world, but there must be <i>some</i> laws that do the explanatory work within these worlds\xE2\x80\x9D (212). But in some of the nearby worlds in which we are dreaming or envatted, surely there <i>are</i> such laws. In fact, in some of those worlds the laws are presumably the same as the laws in this world (the evil scientists in the nearest vat-worlds are simply much more advanced than we are in their understanding of neurobiology). There is thus no obvious reason to think that these worlds lack explanatory coherence.</p>  \n\
  <p>A third, related point: it is unclear why Grundmann and Misselhorn think the skeptic has to accept the burden of <i>showing</i> that his scenarios are <i>metaphysically</i> possible by <i>showing</i> that they are conceivable in the relevant sense. His arguments will still have traction if he remains neutral about that, and simply highlights the <i>epistemic</i> possibility that, for all we know, the world of a skeptical scenario is both metaphysically possible and actual.</p>  \n\
  <p>Let me emphasize that the main worry here is not about whether we can have justified beliefs on the basis of what descriptive metaphysicians tell us. For if they can show that we <i>must</i> conceptualize the world in a certain way, then no doubt we are <i>justified</i> in doing so on at least some conceptions of justification. The worry is rather about whether these inevitable, permissible, and in some sense justified beliefs adequately track reality. A merely descriptive analysis of fundamental categories cannot give us any assurance that they do. Kant puts the point this way:</p>  <blockquote>If [the mind] has to conform to the constitution of the objects, then I do not see how we can know anything of them . <i>priori</i>; but if the object (as an object of the senses) conforms to the constitution of our faculty\xE2\x80\xA6, then I can very well represent this possibility to myself. (Bxvii)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>In sum: analytic Kantians (in the narrow sense) offer us nothing to put in the place of what many readers take to be Kant\xE2\x80\x99s own <i>bona fide</i> idealism, and so despite the ambitions of their transcendental arguments, they remain vulnerable to the skeptic. On this score, I think Strawson himself has done a better job at seeing the deficiencies of his early view than some of his followers.</p>  \n\
  <p>As should be clear from this discussion, there is much that is of interest in this well-executed collection. The contributions are of a very high standard, although their content is somewhat disparate. <i>Strawson and Kant</i> is a fitting tribute to the man who has contributed more than anyone else to the rehabilitation of Kant studies in Anglophone philosophy.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
