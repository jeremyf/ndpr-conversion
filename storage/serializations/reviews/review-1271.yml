content: "<p>Many supporters and critics of \xE2\x80\x9Cmodernity\xE2\x80\x9D have proceeded with an inadequate understanding of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s political philosophy. In this collection of thematically linked essays (some new, others revised for the occasion), Otfried H\xC3\xB6ffe, one of Europe\xE2\x80\x99s leading political philosophers and interpreters of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s practical philosophy, offers a powerful apology for the revival of a more authentically Kantian foundation for contemporary social and political philosophy and for the more nuanced understanding of modernity such a revival would bring. H\xC3\xB6ffe insists that modernity be understood, from its origins, as a \xE2\x80\x9Cpolyphonic\xE2\x80\x9D composition, with Kant\xE2\x80\x99s voice providing the necessary counterpoint to the legitimate, yet exaggerated strains of modernity\xE2\x80\x99s prima donnas, empiricism and pluralism (4). [Contrary to the translation of the subtitle, Kantianism is a counterpoint <i>within</i> modernity.] There is a positive and negative side to H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s thesis. On the positive side, H\xC3\xB6ffe contends that there is a rather compelling justification for Kant\xE2\x80\x99s categorical imperative and the \xE2\x80\x9Ccategorical principles of law\xE2\x80\x9D that follow from it, such as the human rights widely recognized in the modern world. The justificatory refrain is \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical metaphysics plus [moral] anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D (9, 93, 99). On the negative side, H\xC3\xB6ffe alleges, neither contemporary legal theory, given its empirical-pragmatic bias, nor contemporary social theory, given its uncritical obsession with radical pluralism, can justify such categorical principles.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The book is divided into three parts. Part One provides an interpretation of and apology for Kant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CCategorical Imperative of Law (in the singular),\xE2\x80\x9D i.e., \xE2\x80\x9Cact in the external world in such a way that the free use of your voluntary agency is consistent with the freedom of all according to a universal law\xE2\x80\x9D (94). H\xC3\xB6ffe defends this moral principle against claims that it is insufficiently \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical\xE2\x80\x9D (ch. 2), objectionably \xE2\x80\x9Cmoralistic\xE2\x80\x9D (ch. 3), and indefensibly \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical\xE2\x80\x9D and/or abstract (ch.4). Part Two is primarily concerned with several applications of this categorical principle. It begins with a critique of utilitarian attempts to accommodate \xE2\x80\x9Cthe justice objection\xE2\x80\x9D (ch. 6) and proceeds to offer an interpretation and partial defense of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s arguments for the prohibition against false promising, against charges of \xE2\x80\x9Crigorism\xE2\x80\x9D (ch. 7); for the legitimacy of retributive punishment, against its complete dismissal (ch. 8); and for an international confederation of nations, against charges of utopianism (ch. 9). Here the arguments proceed via insightful exegesis, analysis, and reconstruction of key passages from Mill\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Utilitarianism</i>, and Kant\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Groundwork</i>, <i>Doctrine of Right</i>, and \xE2\x80\x9CPerpetual Peace\xE2\x80\x9D essay, respectively. Especially in this section, H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s defenses of Kant are only partial: he sets aside several of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s more extreme and controversial conclusions, for example, that specific moral principles do not allow exceptions even in cases of moral conflict or that criminal punishment is obligatory and should strive for a literal \xE2\x80\x9Ceye for an eye\xE2\x80\x9D and eschew consideration of the subjective elements of crimes. Part Three extends and clarifies several elements of the account (and that offered in <i>Political Justice</i> [1987, trans. 1995]) through critical reviews of the attempts by Axelrod (ch. 10), Rawls (ch. 11), Apel (ch.12) and Habermas (ch. 13) to do without some or all of the core elements of the Kantian account.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The book succeeds at \xE2\x80\x9Cpresenting a conceptual profile\xE2\x80\x9D of the Kantian \xE2\x80\x9Ccounterpoint\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cexamining its validity\xE2\x80\x9D (4). It lays out a provocative and ambitious agenda for Kantian political philosophy in conversation with Adorno, Apel, Axelrod, Habermas, Hegel, Kelsen, L\xC3\xBCbbe, Luhmann, Marquard, Mill, Rawls, Scheler, and others; includes stimulating interpretations and reconstructions of several important Kantian texts; and contains several brief, yet helpful, excursions into the history of political philosophy, law, and social theory. Given its scope and construction, the whole and its parts will be of significant interest to a wide-range of readers (and potentially useful in a variety of seminars, especially given Kenneth Baynes helpful eighteen page foreword.) Given its programmatic nature, there are many nits left to be picked, arguments requiring further development, and responses to be considered. It would be a mistake, especially thirteen years after its original publication (<i>Kategorische Rechtsprinzipien: ein Kontrapunkt der Moderne</i>. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1990) to consider this collection as the last word on modernity, contemporary political philosophy, or even Kant\xE2\x80\x99s place within it. A thorough critical evaluation would have to examine H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s prolific attempts, over the last two decades, to defend and further develop various aspects of this project. Such an examination is certainly beyond the scope of the present review. But it is possible to provide a brief, provisional assessment of H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s Kant interpretation, the strength of his philosophical case, and of the accuracy of this English translation.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The core of H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s proposal emerges in response to the charges that Kant \xE2\x80\x9Cmoralizes politics\xE2\x80\x9D and relies upon dubious \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical abstraction.\xE2\x80\x9D H\xC3\xB6ffe responds to the familiar complaint that Kant \xE2\x80\x9Cmoralizes politics\xE2\x80\x9D by distinguishing between three (or four) different levels of analysis and argumentation and between two different domains of application. \xE2\x80\x9CFirst moral philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CFundamental Ethics\xE2\x80\x9D begins with a semantic account of the <i>concept</i> of morality, the idea of the \xE2\x80\x9Cunconditioned good\xE2\x80\x9D and categorically binding claims, and proceeds to derive a general normative <i>criterion</i> of morality, the categorical imperative and its demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversalizability,\xE2\x80\x9D from this concept. This first moral philosophy, according to H\xC3\xB6ffe, is common to ethics and political philosophy. \xE2\x80\x9CSecond moral philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D is concerned with the application of this general criterion to two different domains: on the one hand, \xE2\x80\x9Claw and right\xE2\x80\x9D [<i>Recht</i>], concerned with law and external action; and on the other, ethics, concerned with individual virtue [<i>Tugend</i>] or \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality\xE2\x80\x9D in the more familiar sense. Within each domain, there are two stages of application. At the \xE2\x80\x9Cgeneral\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cintermediate\xE2\x80\x9D stage of application, a single highest principle is identified for each domain (\xE2\x80\x9CThe Categorical Imperative of Law [in the singular]\xE2\x80\x9D(quoted above) and \xE2\x80\x9CThe Categorical Imperative of Virtue [in the singular]\xE2\x80\x9D, respectively). At the \xE2\x80\x9Cspecial\xE2\x80\x9D stage of application, substantive categorical principles are derived, within each domain, from the relevant principle (5-7). The distinction between the domains of \xE2\x80\x9Cexternal\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cinternal freedom\xE2\x80\x9D within Kant\xE2\x80\x99s unified theory, H\xC3\xB6ffe argues, is what supports Kant\xE2\x80\x99s political anti-moralization thesis, the \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality of law without moralizing\xE2\x80\x9D: (8, 55) state authority can be morally legitimate and is obliged to recognize human rights, but public authorities ought neither demand that individuals comply with the law out of a \xE2\x80\x9Csense of duty,\xE2\x80\x9D nor attempt to legislate all of morality.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>H\xC3\xB6ffe responds to the charges of metaphysical excess and hopeless abstraction with the slogan \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical metaphysics plus anthropology,\xE2\x80\x9D which involves two theses. The integral anthropology thesis maintains (in this case explicitly <i>contra</i> some of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s own excessive programmatic assertions) that, at the fundamental, general and special levels of analysis and within each domain of application, the metaphysical demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversality\xE2\x80\x9D is and must be paired with a \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D which identifies the conditions of application for the relevant universal principle (8-9). The thesis of metaphysical modesty maintains that the metaphysical demand, especially the part of it specific to \xE2\x80\x9CThe Categorical Imperative of Law,\xE2\x80\x9D amounts to a \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical\xE2\x80\x9D rather than a \xE2\x80\x9Ctheoretical metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D and may require neither full-blown transcendental idealism nor, anthropologically, even absolute \xE2\x80\x9Cfreedom of the will.\xE2\x80\x9D This more modest metaphysics is constituted by the unconditional demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversalizability\xE2\x80\x9D or reciprocity applied to a more limited conception of \xE2\x80\x9Cfreedom of action\xE2\x80\x9D(50, 87-88, 92-93). Especially at the \xE2\x80\x9Cspecial\xE2\x80\x9D level of application within the domain of right, H\xC3\xB6ffe argues, the more or less plausible and increasingly concrete anthropology keeps Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theory in contact with the concrete and empirical.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Many aspects of this conception have proven themselves quite promising in the recent Kant literature, and in this context H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s interpretive contributions remain stimulating. In particular, the significance (and contested status) H\xC3\xB6ffe ascribes to the \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D within Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral and political philosophy is beginning to be explored quite fruitfully in recent work by Felicitas Munzel, Robert Louden, Allen Wood, and others. Similarly, H\xC3\xB6ffe draws our attention to the significance of several Kantian distinctions for liberal political theory: the distinction between justice and virtue, the difference between rights and benevolence (both fruitfully explored, for example, in Onora O\xE2\x80\x99Neill\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Toward Justice and Virtue</i>), and the distinct ways in which the legitimation of state authority can be related to justifications of a welfare state. H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s reconstruction of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cfalse promising\xE2\x80\x9D example and his proposals for a Kantian approach to moral dilemmas are worth considering alongside some of Barbara Herman\xE2\x80\x99s work. (Can H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s approach be extended to cover all perfect and imperfect duties?)</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Some will remain unconvinced of H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s central philosophical contention that non-Kantian attempts to ground or account for \xE2\x80\x9Ccategorical principles of law\xE2\x80\x9D are doomed to failure, and that a \xE2\x80\x9Ctranscendental\xE2\x80\x9D grounding focused on Kantian \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversalizability\xE2\x80\x9D will succeed. On the negative side, H\xC3\xB6ffe provides a number of arguments which suggest that familiar pragmatic-empiricist attempts to ground these principles rely on dubious premises and amount to, at best, <i>contingent</i> defenses of what appear to be <i>necessary</i> principles. These arguments, even if compelling, do leave one free to abandon the alleged categorical necessity of the principles rather than the commitment to empiricism. Moreover, even if one concedes that the principles do require a non-empirical, \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical\xE2\x80\x9D grounding, we receive only a \xE2\x80\x9Csketch\xE2\x80\x9D of some of the key arguments, especially those devoted to grounding the Kantian \xE2\x80\x9Cfirst moral philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (76, 183). Without taking anything away from the contribution here, it is important to note that it constitutes a strong apology but not a decisive positive argument.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I would suggest that, in the final analysis, the requisite Kantian argument for the unconditional moral authority of the categorical principles of law may entail some qualification of both the metaphysical modesty thesis and the anti-moralization thesis. Recall H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s contention that, in conjunction with the anti-moralization thesis, Kant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy of law and right . . . dispenses with the freedom of the will\xE2\x80\x9D (50). To be sure, there is an important sense in which the content of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy of law focuses upon external freedom of action rather than autonomous or virtuous motivation (87): the criteria for distinguishing between just and unjust claims, laws, and regimes do not refer to the autonomy or heteronomy manifested by the relevant parties. And, it may also be that, under certain empirical conditions, self-interest will supply everyone with reasons to comply with the demands of Kantian justice, in which case autonomous motivation would be unnecessary (51-52). In at least two respects, however, the normative authority of the categorical principles of right may require more \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D (or metaphysical \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D) than is immediately apparent.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>On H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s account, the categorical principle(s) of law are moral principles: they articulate an unconditional <i>supra-positive norm</i>, in the first instance, <i>for</i> \t\t\t<i>states</i>, \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical orders\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Csocial conditions,\xE2\x80\x9D rather than for individuals (31-32, 40, 54). The presuppositions of the first moral philosophy that H\xC3\xB6ffe would have ground this norm is unclear. Why ought states be concerned with or aspire to the idea of this \xE2\x80\x9Cunconditionally good social order\xE2\x80\x9D? H\xC3\xB6ffe may be correct that <i>some</i> normative standard is essential to distinguishing between a legal order and a criminal enterprise or \xE2\x80\x9Cmere structure of power relations,\xE2\x80\x9D perhaps even that the norm must require that \xE2\x80\x9Cat least in certain cases, those subject to the force of the law are also those that benefit by it\xE2\x80\x9D (46). The justification for the specifically Kantian demand that legal institutions provide, at the fundamental level, an <i>equal</i> benefit to each (rather than merely some benefit to each or a merely collective benefit), seems to be grounded in the claim that objective normative judgment can only be completed in an absolutely \xE2\x80\x9Cunconditioned\xE2\x80\x9D principle (76, 79, 108, 221). But this regress argument to the unconditioned principle may turn out, when elaborated, to presuppose that the \xE2\x80\x9Cjudges,\xE2\x80\x9D those participating in, exercising, and subject to state authority or reflection upon it, are autonomous rational beings.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>A similar conclusion emerges if we consider the normative status that the categorical principles of right have for the actions of <i>individuals</i>. There is some ambiguity in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s (and thus H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s) account about whether the concept of right should include any unconditional demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical legality,\xE2\x80\x9D i.e., an unconditional and supra-positive demand that individuals act (from some motive or another) in compliance with the fundamental demands of right. On the one hand, Kant may seem to suggest that right only commands compliance when there is an empirical motivation ( [6:218,230]; cf. 50, 56, 67, 92). On the other hand, Kant claims, for example, that right requires that all individuals who can enter into the civil condition <i>ought</i> to ([6:306] cf. 94, 127-8, 178). Regardless of how this question is resolved, there seems to be a dilemma. If absolute \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical legality\xE2\x80\x9D is not part of right, then within the theory of right, human rights seem to be less than categorical. To sustain its categoricity, one would have to invoke ethics, which requires juridical legality as a presupposition of \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical morality,\xE2\x80\x9D but would thereby be drawing on the stronger metaphysical assumptions of ethics. If juridical legality is considered part of right, its absoluteness would entail that right presuppose that there is always a motive to comply with its demands. Right would need to presuppose either that people have a capacity to be motivated by \xE2\x80\x9Cduty\xE2\x80\x9D when self-interested motivation is lacking (presupposing \xE2\x80\x9Cfreedom of the will\xE2\x80\x9D), or it would need to presuppose that there is, as Kant thought, a providential \xE2\x80\x9Ccoincidence\xE2\x80\x9D between enlightened self-interest and the demands of right that holds for all of its subjects (51, 193-4). Either way, the categorical demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical legality\xE2\x80\x9D requires a substantial \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical\xE2\x80\x9D assumption.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>H\xC3\xB6ffe is correct that in this context we may leave open the question of whether the \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D is best defended with or without appeal to other aspects of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophical system (64, 77). My critical philosophical suggestion, however, prepared by H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s own insightful analysis, is that, in spite of the important distinction between the domains of right and virtue, the normativity of Kantian categorical principles of right, for both the state and the individual, may depend upon a bit more \xE2\x80\x9Cmoralizing\xE2\x80\x9D of politics and/or a bit more of the more demanding \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D (or metaphysical anthropology) associated with Kantian morality than may be explicitly acknowledged here or in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s texts.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The translation of the German word \xE2\x80\x9C<i>Recht</i>\xE2\x80\x9D and its relatives is the source of many difficulties and controversies, as English-speakers familiar with Kant\xE2\x80\x99s political philosophy are well aware. Some awkwardness or confusion is unavoidable. The translator\xE2\x80\x99s choice to switch between \xE2\x80\x9Claw and right,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Claw,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cright,\xE2\x80\x9D and their cognates, and late in the book to switch intentionally, yet suddenly and inexplicably, to \xE2\x80\x9C<i>Recht</i>\xE2\x80\x9D may strike some as less than ideal (227, cf. xxxvi). H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s phrase \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality of law without moralizing\xE2\x80\x9D hints at two related challenges: within Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theory \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality\xE2\x80\x9D (and its relatives) sometimes seem to refer to both ethics and political philosophy, other times only to ethics; and within ethics, Kant draws a motivational distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality\xE2\x80\x9D and mere \xE2\x80\x9Clegality,\xE2\x80\x9D the latter of which can be easily confused with the \xE2\x80\x9Clegality\xE2\x80\x9D and laws discussed in political philosophy. To avoid confusion, a translation of a contemporary work needs to adopt (even interpolate, if necessary) and strictly adhere to some technical terminology; variation can seem to suggest unintended distinctions. Somewhat unfortunately, this translation seems to vary its technical interpolations as the book progresses: at different points in the book, for example, the ethical subdomain and/or its special motive are identified in terms of \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral worth,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral goodness,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral autonomy,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cstrict morality,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cethics proper,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cfull blown\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cfull fledged morality.\xE2\x80\x9D [The frequent interpolation of \xE2\x80\x9Cstrict\xE2\x80\x9D morality (50f, 130) is potentially confusing since H\xC3\xB6ffe himself uses a different \xE2\x80\x9Cstrict\xE2\x80\x9D sense in another passage (221).] On some occasions, technical terms are also misused (e.g. Rawls\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Coriginal situation\xE2\x80\x9D[220], \xE2\x80\x9Cdivision of powers\xE2\x80\x9D rather than \xE2\x80\x9Cseparation of powers\xE2\x80\x9D[79-80, 186, 277]). Other mistranslations mistakenly suggest interpretive or philosophical errors, e.g., the assertion that happiness (rather than happiness in proportion to virtue) is the complete good (246); or the running of the same transcendental argument in opposite directions (76). This translation also drops, for no obvious reason, a number of in-text citations and cross-references, and drops (inconsistently) the original\xE2\x80\x99s helpful use of italics to highlight organizational cues. Nonetheless, the present translation manages, by and large, to make this interesting and important work available, at last, to English-speaking readers. For this we should be grateful.</p>"

  <p>The book is divided into three parts.

It lays out a provocative and ambitious agenda for Kantian political philosophy in conversation with Adorno, Apel, Axelrod, Habermas, Hegel, Kelsen, L\xC3\xBCbbe, Luhmann, Marquard, Mill, Rawls, Scheler, and others; includes stimulating interpretations and reconstructions of several important Kantian texts; and contains several brief, yet helpful, excursions into the history of political philosophy, law, and social theory. Given its scope and construction, the whole and its parts will be of significant interest to a wide-range of readers (and potentially useful in a variety of seminars, especially given Kenneth Baynes helpful eighteen page foreword.) Given its programmatic nature, there are many nits left to be picked, arguments requiring further development, and responses to be considered. It would be a mistake, especially thirteen years after its original publication (<i>Kategorische Rechtsprinzipien: ein Kontrapunkt der Moderne</i>. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1990) to consider this collection as the last word on modernity, contemporary political philosophy, or even Kant\xE2\x80\x99s place within it. A thorough critical evaluation would have to examine H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s prolific attempts, over the last two decades, to defend and further develop various aspects of this project. Such an examination is certainly beyond the scope of the present review. But it is possible to provide a brief, provisional assessment of H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s Kant interpretation, the strength of his philosophical case, and of the accuracy of this English translation.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The core of H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s proposal emerges in response to the charges that Kant \xE2\x80\x9Cmoralizes politics\xE2\x80\x9D and relies upon dubious \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical abstraction.\xE2\x80\x9D H\xC3\xB6ffe responds to the familiar complaint that Kant \xE2\x80\x9Cmoralizes politics\xE2\x80\x9D by distinguishing between three (or four) different levels of analysis and argumentation and between two different domains of application. \xE2\x80\x9CFirst moral philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CFundamental Ethics\xE2\x80\x9D begins with a semantic account of the <i>concept</i> of morality, the idea of the \xE2\x80\x9Cunconditioned good\xE2\x80\x9D and categorically binding claims, and proceeds to derive a general normative <i>criterion</i> of morality, the categorical imperative and its demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversalizability,\xE2\x80\x9D from this concept. This first moral philosophy, according to H\xC3\xB6ffe, is common to ethics and political philosophy. \xE2\x80\x9CSecond moral philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D is concerned with the application of this general criterion to two different domains: on the one hand, \xE2\x80\x9Claw and right\xE2\x80\x9D [<i>Recht</i>], concerned with law and external action; and on the other, ethics, concerned with individual virtue [<i>Tugend</i>] or \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality\xE2\x80\x9D in the more familiar sense. Within each domain, there are two stages of application. At the \xE2\x80\x9Cgeneral\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cintermediate\xE2\x80\x9D stage of application, a single highest principle is identified for each domain (\xE2\x80\x9CThe Categorical Imperative of Law [in the singular]\xE2\x80\x9D(quoted above) and \xE2\x80\x9CThe Categorical Imperative of Virtue [in the singular]\xE2\x80\x9D, respectively). At the \xE2\x80\x9Cspecial\xE2\x80\x9D stage of application, substantive categorical principles are derived, within each domain, from the relevant principle (5-7). The distinction between the domains of \xE2\x80\x9Cexternal\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cinternal freedom\xE2\x80\x9D within Kant\xE2\x80\x99s unified theory, H\xC3\xB6ffe argues, is what supports Kant\xE2\x80\x99s political anti-moralization thesis, the \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality of law without moralizing\xE2\x80\x9D: (8, 55) state authority can be morally legitimate and is obliged to recognize human rights, but public authorities ought neither demand that individuals comply with the law out of a \xE2\x80\x9Csense of duty,\xE2\x80\x9D nor attempt to legislate all of morality.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>H\xC3\xB6ffe responds to the charges of metaphysical excess and hopeless abstraction with the slogan \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical metaphysics plus anthropology,\xE2\x80\x9D which involves two theses. The integral anthropology thesis maintains (in this case explicitly <i>contra</i> some of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s own excessive programmatic assertions) that, at the fundamental, general and special levels of analysis and within each domain of application, the metaphysical demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversality\xE2\x80\x9D is and must be paired with a \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D which identifies the conditions of application for the relevant universal principle (8-9). The thesis of metaphysical modesty maintains that the metaphysical demand, especially the part of it specific to \xE2\x80\x9CThe Categorical Imperative of Law,\xE2\x80\x9D amounts to a \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical\xE2\x80\x9D rather than a \xE2\x80\x9Ctheoretical metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D and may require neither full-blown transcendental idealism nor, anthropologically, even absolute \xE2\x80\x9Cfreedom of the will.\xE2\x80\x9D This more modest metaphysics is constituted by the unconditional demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversalizability\xE2\x80\x9D or reciprocity applied to a more limited conception of \xE2\x80\x9Cfreedom of action\xE2\x80\x9D(50, 87-88, 92-93). Especially at the \xE2\x80\x9Cspecial\xE2\x80\x9D level of application within the domain of right, H\xC3\xB6ffe argues, the more or less plausible and increasingly concrete anthropology keeps Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theory in contact with the concrete and empirical.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Many aspects of this conception have proven themselves quite promising in the recent Kant literature, and in this context H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s interpretive contributions remain stimulating. In particular, the significance (and contested status) H\xC3\xB6ffe ascribes to the \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D within Kant\xE2\x80\x99s moral and political philosophy is beginning to be explored quite fruitfully in recent work by Felicitas Munzel, Robert Louden, Allen Wood, and others. Similarly, H\xC3\xB6ffe draws our attention to the significance of several Kantian distinctions for liberal political theory: the distinction between justice and virtue, the difference between rights and benevolence (both fruitfully explored, for example, in Onora O\xE2\x80\x99Neill\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Toward Justice and Virtue</i>), and the distinct ways in which the legitimation of state authority can be related to justifications of a welfare state. H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s reconstruction of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cfalse promising\xE2\x80\x9D example and his proposals for a Kantian approach to moral dilemmas are worth considering alongside some of Barbara Herman\xE2\x80\x99s work. (Can H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s approach be extended to cover all perfect and imperfect duties?)</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Some will remain unconvinced of H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s central philosophical contention that non-Kantian attempts to ground or account for \xE2\x80\x9Ccategorical principles of law\xE2\x80\x9D are doomed to failure, and that a \xE2\x80\x9Ctranscendental\xE2\x80\x9D grounding focused on Kantian \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversalizability\xE2\x80\x9D will succeed. On the negative side, H\xC3\xB6ffe provides a number of arguments which suggest that familiar pragmatic-empiricist attempts to ground these principles rely on dubious premises and amount to, at best, <i>contingent</i> defenses of what appear to be <i>necessary</i> principles. These arguments, even if compelling, do leave one free to abandon the alleged categorical necessity of the principles rather than the commitment to empiricism. Moreover, even if one concedes that the principles do require a non-empirical, \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical\xE2\x80\x9D grounding, we receive only a \xE2\x80\x9Csketch\xE2\x80\x9D of some of the key arguments, especially those devoted to grounding the Kantian \xE2\x80\x9Cfirst moral philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (76, 183). Without taking anything away from the contribution here, it is important to note that it constitutes a strong apology but not a decisive positive argument.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I would suggest that, in the final analysis, the requisite Kantian argument for the unconditional moral authority of the categorical principles of law may entail some qualification of both the metaphysical modesty thesis and the anti-moralization thesis. Recall H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s contention that, in conjunction with the anti-moralization thesis, Kant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy of law and right . . . dispenses with the freedom of the will\xE2\x80\x9D (50). To be sure, there is an important sense in which the content of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy of law focuses upon external freedom of action rather than autonomous or virtuous motivation (87): the criteria for distinguishing between just and unjust claims, laws, and regimes do not refer to the autonomy or heteronomy manifested by the relevant parties. And, it may also be that, under certain empirical conditions, self-interest will supply everyone with reasons to comply with the demands of Kantian justice, in which case autonomous motivation would be unnecessary (51-52). In at least two respects, however, the normative authority of the categorical principles of right may require more \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D (or metaphysical \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral anthropology\xE2\x80\x9D) than is immediately apparent.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>On H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s account, the categorical principle(s) of law are moral principles: they articulate an unconditional <i>supra-positive norm</i>, in the first instance, <i>for</i> \t\t\t<i>states</i>, \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical orders\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Csocial conditions,\xE2\x80\x9D rather than for individuals (31-32, 40, 54). The presuppositions of the first moral philosophy that H\xC3\xB6ffe would have ground this norm is unclear. Why ought states be concerned with or aspire to the idea of this \xE2\x80\x9Cunconditionally good social order\xE2\x80\x9D? H\xC3\xB6ffe may be correct that <i>some</i> normative standard is essential to distinguishing between a legal order and a criminal enterprise or \xE2\x80\x9Cmere structure of power relations,\xE2\x80\x9D perhaps even that the norm must require that \xE2\x80\x9Cat least in certain cases, those subject to the force of the law are also those that benefit by it\xE2\x80\x9D (46). The justification for the specifically Kantian demand that legal institutions provide, at the fundamental level, an <i>equal</i> benefit to each (rather than merely some benefit to each or a merely collective benefit), seems to be grounded in the claim that objective normative judgment can only be completed in an absolutely \xE2\x80\x9Cunconditioned\xE2\x80\x9D principle (76, 79, 108, 221). But this regress argument to the unconditioned principle may turn out, when elaborated, to presuppose that the \xE2\x80\x9Cjudges,\xE2\x80\x9D those participating in, exercising, and subject to state authority or reflection upon it, are autonomous rational beings.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>A similar conclusion emerges if we consider the normative status that the categorical principles of right have for the actions of <i>individuals</i>. There is some ambiguity in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s (and thus H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s) account about whether the concept of right should include any unconditional demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical legality,\xE2\x80\x9D i.e., an unconditional and supra-positive demand that individuals act (from some motive or another) in compliance with the fundamental demands of right. On the one hand, Kant may seem to suggest that right only commands compliance when there is an empirical motivation ( [6:218,230]; cf. 50, 56, 67, 92). On the other hand, Kant claims, for example, that right requires that all individuals who can enter into the civil condition <i>ought</i> to ([6:306] cf. 94, 127-8, 178). Regardless of how this question is resolved, there seems to be a dilemma. If absolute \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical legality\xE2\x80\x9D is not part of right, then within the theory of right, human rights seem to be less than categorical. To sustain its categoricity, one would have to invoke ethics, which requires juridical legality as a presupposition of \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical morality,\xE2\x80\x9D but would thereby be drawing on the stronger metaphysical assumptions of ethics. If juridical legality is considered part of right, its absoluteness would entail that right presuppose that there is always a motive to comply with its demands. Right would need to presuppose either that people have a capacity to be motivated by \xE2\x80\x9Cduty\xE2\x80\x9D when self-interested motivation is lacking (presupposing \xE2\x80\x9Cfreedom of the will\xE2\x80\x9D), or it would need to presuppose that there is, as Kant thought, a providential \xE2\x80\x9Ccoincidence\xE2\x80\x9D between enlightened self-interest and the demands of right that holds for all of its subjects (51, 193-4). Either way, the categorical demand for \xE2\x80\x9Cjuridical legality\xE2\x80\x9D requires a substantial \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysical\xE2\x80\x9D assumption.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>H\xC3\xB6ffe is correct that in this context we may leave open the question of whether the \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D is best defended with or without appeal to other aspects of Kant\xE2\x80\x99s philosophical system (64, 77). My critical philosophical suggestion, however, prepared by H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s own insightful analysis, is that, in spite of the important distinction between the domains of right and virtue, the normativity of Kantian categorical principles of right, for both the state and the individual, may depend upon a bit more \xE2\x80\x9Cmoralizing\xE2\x80\x9D of politics and/or a bit more of the more demanding \xE2\x80\x9Cpractical metaphysics\xE2\x80\x9D (or metaphysical anthropology) associated with Kantian morality than may be explicitly acknowledged here or in Kant\xE2\x80\x99s texts.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The translation of the German word \xE2\x80\x9C<i>Recht</i>\xE2\x80\x9D and its relatives is the source of many difficulties and controversies, as English-speakers familiar with Kant\xE2\x80\x99s political philosophy are well aware. Some awkwardness or confusion is unavoidable. The translator\xE2\x80\x99s choice to switch between \xE2\x80\x9Claw and right,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Claw,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cright,\xE2\x80\x9D and their cognates, and late in the book to switch intentionally, yet suddenly and inexplicably, to \xE2\x80\x9C<i>Recht</i>\xE2\x80\x9D may strike some as less than ideal (227, cf. xxxvi). H\xC3\xB6ffe\xE2\x80\x99s phrase \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality of law without moralizing\xE2\x80\x9D hints at two related challenges: within Kant\xE2\x80\x99s theory \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality\xE2\x80\x9D (and its relatives) sometimes seem to refer to both ethics and political philosophy, other times only to ethics; and within ethics, Kant draws a motivational distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Cmorality\xE2\x80\x9D and mere \xE2\x80\x9Clegality,\xE2\x80\x9D the latter of which can be easily confused with the \xE2\x80\x9Clegality\xE2\x80\x9D and laws discussed in political philosophy. To avoid confusion, a translation of a contemporary work needs to adopt (even interpolate, if necessary) and strictly adhere to some technical terminology; variation can seem to suggest unintended distinctions. Somewhat unfortunately, this translation seems to vary its technical interpolations as the book progresses: at different points in the book, for example, the ethical subdomain and/or its special motive are identified in terms of \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral worth,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral goodness,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral autonomy,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cstrict morality,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Cethics proper,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cfull blown\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cfull fledged morality.\xE2\x80\x9D [The frequent interpolation of \xE2\x80\x9Cstrict\xE2\x80\x9D morality (50f, 130) is potentially confusing since H\xC3\xB6ffe himself uses a different \xE2\x80\x9Cstrict\xE2\x80\x9D sense in another passage (221).] On some occasions, technical terms are also misused (e.g. Rawls\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Coriginal situation\xE2\x80\x9D[220], \xE2\x80\x9Cdivision of powers\xE2\x80\x9D rather than \xE2\x80\x9Cseparation of powers\xE2\x80\x9D[79-80, 186, 277]). Other mistranslations mistakenly suggest interpretive or philosophical errors, e.g., the assertion that happiness (rather than happiness in proportion to virtue) is the complete good (246); or the running of the same transcendental argument in opposite directions (76). This translation also drops, for no obvious reason, a number of in-text citations and cross-references, and drops (inconsistently) the original\xE2\x80\x99s helpful use of italics to highlight organizational cues. Nonetheless, the present translation manages, by and large, to make this interesting and important work available, at last, to English-speaking readers. For this we should be grateful.</p>"
