content: "<p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Sharon Lloyd's bold and  engaging new book <i style=\"\">Morality in the Philosophy of Thomas  Hobbes: Cases in the Law of Nature</i> is an important companion to her  wonderful first book, <i style=\"\">Ideals as Interests in Hobbes's Leviathan</i>. In the new book, Professor Lloyd presents and defends an exciting and novel interpretation of Hobbes's moral and political  theory. Hobbes scholars will no doubt spill much ink critiquing the unorthodox  readings of many famous passages and the quite bold overall interpretation of  Hobbes's moral and political theory found in the book. But, because I am not a  Hobbes specialist, this review shall not assess the accuracy of Lloyd's  exegesis. Instead, this review will contain first-order philosophical engagement  with the central project Lloyd imputes to Hobbes. This project is the  construction of a meta-normative theory, which Lloyd calls the <i style=\"\">reciprocity  theory of reason</i>. This theory is meant both to ground the authority of and generate content for the Laws of Nature. Hopefully,  my focus on theory instead of exegesis will help to clarify Lloyd's account  of Hobbes's moral and political theory. This may be especially appropriate  given that Lloyd ends the book by arguing for the contemporary relevance of  Hobbes's philosophical positions.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Traditionally -- and especially for the past two  generations -- Hobbes scholars have attributed to Hobbes a brutally simplistic  emotivism: being good just is being desired, and one has a reason to <span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\">j</span></span> just in case (more or less) <span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\">j</span></span>-ing  satisfies a desire. In light of this, one needn't -- and many haven't -- read Hobbes as an egoist. For, one can desire  other people's welfare. One would thereby see another's welfare as good and  therefore see promoting the other's welfare as a reason to act. So, Hobbes is no  egoist. But, even though one implausible result is avoided, the simple emotivism  most Hobbes scholars attribute to Hobbes is itself incredible. Consequently,  readers of the traditional interpretations of Hobbes may quite correctly lodge foundational objections on the basis of the absurdity of Hobbes's  purported meta-normative commitments. This is especially the case given that  Hobbes is a rigorously systematic theorist. By Hobbes's very own lights, if the  foundations of his theory are flawed, then the entire theory fails to get off the  ground. Those interested in Hobbes but uninterested in pure exegesis are thereby immediately driven to a reconstructive project like Gregory Kavka's:  develop a <i style=\"\">Hobbesian </i>moral and political theory while eschewing <i style=\"\">Hobbes's</i> moral and political theory.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The central claim of Lloyd's book is a response  to this kind of pessimism about Hobbes's moral and political theory, and it is a  truly audacious claim: Thomas Hobbes has a heretofore unrecognized and philosophically respectable meta-normative theory, a theory Lloyd calls  the <i style=\"\">reciprocity theorem of reason</i> (hereafter RT). The RT explains normativity in terms of certain inescapable demands  of agency and it gives the contents of practical reasons, and the contents  of the Laws of Nature in particular, by way of a construction procedure  involving idealized reciprocal judgments of blamelessness. In short, Lloyd argues  that Hobbes offers what we today call a constitutivist grounding of the  authority of reason and a constructivist theory of the content of morality. As I  said: Lloyd's reading of Hobbes is truly audacious.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The RT makes its appearance in an argument that  spins out what it means for a being to be a rational animal (pp. 219-220). First,  if a being is a rational animal, then it behaves in accordance with right  reason. This is not mere accidental conformity, but is instead a matter of  acting <i style=\"\">on </i>a practical reason. Lloyd leaves aside the question of how something acts on some consideration or other  -- Hobbes never discusses this question -- and instead focuses exclusively  on what sort of thing a practical reason is. Presumably, once that is spelled  out, it will be unproblematic to give an account of what it is to act on  practical reasons, which in turn will give us an account of what it is for a being  to be a rational animal. So all the work is done by the account of what it is  to be a practical reason. The RT supposedly does that work.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The RT as formally stated by Lloyd is as  follows:</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">If one judges  another's doing of an action to be without right, and yet does that action oneself, one  acts contrary to reason. . . . That is, to do what one condemns in another is contrary to reason. (p. 220, italics removed)</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Right off the bat, let us note that Lloyd  initially describes the RT as a <i style=\"\">constraint </i>on reason. This though is quite incorrect (Lloyd seems to recognize this  when she later explains that she is \"unfolding the conception of reason Thomas Hobbes takes to be the common understanding of his time, and the  conception underlying the natural law tradition that he insists he is  illuminating.\" [p. 223]). For, constraints on what reason can require cannot alone yield  fully determinate contents of reasons or, for that matter, rational  requirements. But, the RT <i style=\"\">is </i>supposed to yield just such fully determinate contents of reasons and the Laws of Nature. So,  the RT is more than a mere constraint; it is a substantive account of what  reason requires.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The basic idea behind the RT is that the  contents of practical reasons are determined primarily by the interaction of the  following things: a certain reactive attitude, namely blame, a consistency  requirement, and a consideration-action pair {R, \xCF\x86}. In particular, a consideration R in favor of \xCF\x86<span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\"></span></span>-ing is a <i style=\"\">reason </i>to \xCF\x86 if {R, \xCF\x86<span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\"></span></span>} can, without contradiction, be a part of a perfectly consistent practice  of not blaming people for \xCF\x86-ing for  the sake of R. If one sincerely blames some people for \xCF\x86-ing on the basis of R but (in all sincerity) does not blame others (e.g.,  like himself), then R is either not a reason to \xCF\x86 or, more likely, one is being criticizably inconsistent in not recognizing that others are  acting on legitimate reasons. We would distinguish between these two judgments as follows: if there is <i style=\"\">not</i> a perfectly consistent practice of not blaming people for \xCF\x86-ing for the sake of R, then R is not a reason to \xCF\x86; if there <i style=\"\">is</i> a perfectly consistent practice of not blaming people for \xCF\x86-ing for the sake of R, then one is being criticizably inconsistent.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Perhaps what is most initially striking about  this is the role that reactive attitudes play in this account. Lloyd is quite up  front about this: \"only one's own judgments of blameworthiness can provide one with reasons\" (p. 227). Although this retains certain features of the traditional emotivist reading of Hobbes, a reactive attitudes-based meta-normative theory is highly sophisticated. Consequently, this  reading of Hobbes may seem anachronistic to some Hobbes scholars (especially since  many may think that it strays quite far from the texts), but in my opinion  there is much about this reading that creatively and charitably captures the  spirit of the more familiar accounts of Hobbes's views.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">All this being said, the reactive attitudes are  not in fact what are at the heart of Lloyd's account of the RT. Lloyd writes  that one has \"nothing that counts as a reason at all unless it is a justifying consideration [one] would be willing not just to give to others but also  to accept from them as justifying their like conduct.\" (p. 227) Lloyd recognizes that the mere invocation of reactive attitudes is not enough  to keep a meta-normative theory of practical reason from collapsing into a kind  of subjectivism -- in this case actual dispositions to blame entirely  determining the content of practical reasons -- that has already been rejected as  overly simplistic. Charity, at least, requires that we read Hobbes as having  more to say about the source of practical reasons. And the consistency  requirement is that something more, for it blocks an utterly subjective and  consequently utterly implausible meta-normative theory. It does this by grounding  reasons to <span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\">j</span></span> not in <i style=\"\">actual</i> dispositions to blame, but instead in <i style=\"\">consistent </i>dispositions to blame. In particular, regardless of whether one is <i style=\"\">disposed</i>  to accept from another some consideration as rendering blameless (i.e., as justifying) that other person's action, so long as  one demands <i style=\"\">from </i>others that they treat that consideration as rendering blameless one's <i style=\"\">own </i>action,  one thereby commits oneself to accepting that consideration as a justification <i style=\"\">from </i>others. While this is not quite enough to generate a practical reason -- {R, \xCF\x86} must bear the appropriate rational connection with one another -- it is  this consistency requirement that does most of the theoretical heavy lifting.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">This is also from whence the reciprocity of the  RT comes. Reciprocity exists when some person, A, would both expect others to  accept R as justifying his own \xCF\x86-ing, <i style=\"\">and</i> would accept from others R as justifying <i style=\"\">their </i>own \xCF\x86-ing. But, Lloyd argues, so long as A expects others to accept R as justifying  his \xCF\x86-ing, consistency  requires that A accepts from others R as justifying their \xCF\x86-ing. Why? Apparently, according to Lloyd's Hobbes, this follows from the  nature of what it is for some consideration to be a reason. For, being a reason to \xCF\x86 cannot be indexed to a particular person; reasons by their very nature  apply to all who are in a certain situation. There can be no rational  haecceities, as it were. Thus, if A expects others to accept R as justifying his \xCF\x86-ing, then A must accept R as justifying others' \xCF\x86-ing.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Lloyd deploys one of Hobbes's examples to  effectively illuminate this point. Suppose A intends to invade B's country, for the  sake of R, namely to spread the one true religion. Is R a reason for A to invade  B? This depends upon whether A would accept from B an appeal to R as a justification for invading <i style=\"\">A's </i>country. Of course, if R is pitched in terms of spreading the one true religion  where the referent of \"one true religion\" is fixed by A's beliefs, then A might accept the reason. But, consistency requires A treating the  referent of \"one true religion\" as something B would accept (since B would deny that the religion A is spreading is the one true religion). So, whether R  is a reason for A to invade B's country depends upon whether A would accept  that B is blameless for invading A's country in order to spread what <i style=\"\">B </i>believes is the one true religion. Since A's invasion of B's country is premised upon B's religion not  being the one true religion, A could not accept that B is blameless for invading  A's own country to spread what <i style=\"\">B </i>believes is the one true religion. So, all else being equal, A does not have a  reason to invade B's country.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">All this is starting to sound suspiciously  Kantian -- or even Scanlonian. But not to worry. For, whether someone has a reason to \xCF\x86 depends partially on her occurrent attitudes: what she wants to do and  what she would offer as a justifying reason to others. RT is therefore a <i style=\"\">perspectival </i>theory of practical reason. The tempering provided by the consistency requirement generates only a  modest objectivity. Consequently, if B would never, ever offer R as a  justification for his \xCF\x86-ing, but  A would do so, then R is a reason to \xCF\x86 <i style=\"\">only</i> for A, and not for B.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Much more must be said -- and Lloyd offers a  very nice discussion at pp. 222-230 -- about how to formulate the  act-consideration pair that is then to be 'tested' by the RT. Space restrictions prevent me  from exploring Lloyd's discussion of this issue. A brief comment is worth  making though.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">As Lloyd rightly highlights, the problem of the formulation of the act-consideration pair is somewhat symmetrical to the problem of the formulation of the Kantian maxim that is tested by the Categorical Imperative. The problem distinctive to Hobbes, though, is  that there is no universally correct unique formulation of the  act-consideration pair (as there is in, e.g., the famous cases in Kant's <i style=\"\">Groundwork</i>).  The formulation depends upon the <i style=\"\">actual</i> attitudes of  the acting agent and, in a very interesting way, the actual attitudes of those with whom that agent interacts in  virtue of the action in question. The RT can also apply recursively if we treat as  an action the very application of an action-description when assessing  whether one is justified in action. Thus Lloyd writes:</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">we must each step  back a pace from the primary dispute and ask whether each is content to allow the  other to deliberate on the basis of that other's preferred action-description. If  so, and they are content to disagree, the reciprocity theorem allows that  each acts in accordance with reason in [e.g.,] seeking to impose his or her own  (as they see it, true) religion while condemning the other's attempt to impose  their different religion. If not, and each would fault the other for  arrogantly insisting upon his or her own action-description in this important and contested case, then the reciprocity theorem . . . will not permit those  who fault others for insisting on a contested action-description to insist  on their own contested action-description. (p. 225)<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Gathering these reflections together, let us  render the RT as follows:</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">(RT) Assuming A  intends to \xCF\x86<span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\"></span></span>  for the sake of R: R is a reason for A to \xCF\x86 iff a perfectly consistent A would not blame anyone for \xCF\x86-ing for R.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The RT is a <i style=\"\">constructivist </i>account of practical reason since it explains what counts as a  reason in terms of a suitably constructed subject's responses to actions on the  basis of certain considerations. If the constructed subject is not disposed to  blame someone performing that action for the sake of that consideration, then  insofar as someone takes that consideration to apply to her, then she has a  reason to act. This is not the twentieth-century's constructivism, which aims at a somewhat more robust universality than the RT's constructivism. But, it  is constructivism nonetheless.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The RT also amounts to what many today call <i style=\"\">constitutivism</i>.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup> Constitutivism is the view that the objective authority of moral norms  (and perhaps even value) can be grounded in norms or aims that are supposedly constitutive of human practical agency. The RT is constitutivist because  it is, itself, grounded in the nature of human rationality. The argument, given  at pp. 219-220 and partially summarized above, runs as follows:</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">1.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>Humans are rational beings.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">2.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>But what makes a being rational is  that it acts for reasons.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">3.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>In particular, what it is to <i style=\"\">act</i> as opposed merely to behave in a manner driven by one's desires and fears is to guide one's behavior by  way of appeal to reasons one takes oneself to have.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">4.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>But, behaving in light of the reasons  one takes oneself to have just is to act in a way that meets the standard  expressed by the RT.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">5.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>So, if humans are to act at all, they  must act in accordance with the RT.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">6.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>Humans are inescapably driven to act.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">7.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>So, humans are inescapably governed  by the RT: \"any agent whose actions are to accord with reason must regulate his own actions by the standards of judgment he applies to the actions of  others.\" (p. 248)</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The constitutive feature of Lloyd's account of  Hobbes's meta-normative theory receives short shrift in the text. But since she  argues that the authority of the Laws of Nature is grounded in the authority of  the RT, the question of what grounds the authority of the RT immediately  arises. Lloyd never asks this question, but it's because she seems to think that  once it is demonstrated that the RT follows from what it is to be a rational  being, the authority of the RT will be self-evident. Thus she writes: \"The reasonable is built into our conception of man as a rational animal from  the very beginning.\" (p. 233) But, if by \"the reasonable\" she means only \"the content of the laws of nature\" then she leaves Hobbes open to the obvious challenge: \"But why obey the laws of nature?\" Lloyd simply does not see this question as on the table. But of course it is!  And, if Lloyd fails to answer it, then the meta-normative theory she imputes to  Hobbes remains incomplete and unsatisfying. Fortunately, what Lloyd says Hobbes  is up to amounts to an attempt to answer the question, even though Lloyd  doesn't recognize the significance of what she herself is up to.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">In sum, we have a constructivist account of how  practical reasons get their contents and a constitutivist account of how practical reasons get their authority and all this pivots around the RT.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup> As I've already stated, this is, in light of the commonly accepted understanding of Hobbes, a very startling interpretation.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Let us now briefly consider Lloyd's  interpretation of how the contents of the Laws of Nature (LoN) follow from the RT (this  discussion is at pp. 234-247). The argument Lloyd sees in Hobbes, which can be found  at pp. 241-242, runs roughly as follows.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">A central concept for Hobbes is <i style=\"\">power</i>,  which is the ability to satisfy one's desires. The one necessary desire that all agents have, regardless of the content of any  of their other desires, is the desire for power. A necessary condition for  power is peace. Therefore, on pain of inconsistency, each person must treat  the desire for power as justification for seeking peace. So each person must  accept that every other person may blamelessly seek peace out of the desire for  power. That is, everyone has a practical reason to seek peace.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">But, this argument fails to establish an  obligation. For, there is a difference between demonstrating that everyone has a reason  to do something and demonstrating that there is a rational <i style=\"\">requirement</i>  that all people do something. And the Law of Nature is a rational requirement; it is <i style=\"\">not</i> merely a reason that all persons have. For, the LoN says that <i style=\"\">not </i>seeking peace (and if peace isn't available then not defending oneself) is <i style=\"\">irrational</i>. So, to show that the RT grounds the LoN, Lloyd must show how the RT  rules out <i style=\"\">ever </i>having a reason <i style=\"\">not </i>to  seek peace.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Notice, by the way, that the character who Lloyd  must demonstrate hasn't reasons not to seek peace isn't the glory-seeker. The  glory-seeker, who claims that the desire for glory is a reason not to seek peace,  could not accept from <i style=\"\">others</i> that they have this reason not to seek peace. For, the glory-seeker requires others to  stand in awe of him and to obey him. But, if these others have reasons to war  with him, then he doesn't have their awe. So, the glory-seeker would be  guilty of inconsistency if he insists that he has a reason not to seek peace.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The character who poses a problem for Lloyd's  derivation of the first LoN is the <i style=\"\">lover of chaos</i> (this is my own invention -- neither Hobbes nor Lloyd ever mentions this character). This person would offer her love of chaos as a justification  for not seeking peace. She would also happily accept from anyone else a  similar love as a legitimate justification for not seeking peace. For, others  not seeking peace would generate more beloved chaos. So, while the chaos  lover may have a reason to seek peace, she also can consistently recognize a  reason <i style=\"\">not </i>to seek peace. That is, she is not obligated to seek peace.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Lloyd must argue that the love of chaos could  never be a reason for action for anyone. This is tricky but I think Lloyd finds the resources in Hobbes for such an argument. The argument would look  something like the following. Being an agent essentially involves the desire not  to have one's power totally destroyed. Since action can only be the product of  agency, action presumes the desire not to have one's power totally destroyed.  So, desiring not to have power is tantamount to desiring not to act. So,  insofar as one acts, one desires not to have one's power totally destroyed. So, no  one could ever sincerely and without contradiction offer the desire not to  have any power as a justification for <i style=\"\">any </i>action. Chaos is the same as war and war is the absence of power. So, one can  never argue that her love of chaos (i.e., the desire for no power) is a reason  for <i style=\"\">any </i>action, even if that action is seeking war. I do not endorse this argument, but I think Lloyd's  interpretation of Hobbes allows Hobbes to make it in response to the chaos-lover. I  think that Lloyd's account of Hobbes's derivation of the LoN from the RT would be  stronger had she considered something like this argument.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The very narrow focus of this book review -- I  discuss almost exclusively the approximately fifty pages of Chapter Five -- is  not meant to suggest that there are not other fascinating and well-argued  features of this book. Lloyd's discussion of the self-effacing character of  natural law is innovative and the best analysis I've seen of Hobbes's account of the relationship between natural law and positive law. Her re-reading of  Hobbes's response to the Foole is also groundbreaking. In addition to these very substantial discussions late in the book, there are numerous other  significant observations that not only profoundly illuminate Hobbes's overall  normative project but that will also significantly change the landscape of Hobbes scholarship in analytic philosophy. For example, Lloyd rightly  highlights that Hobbes believed that the desire to justify oneself plays a central,  driving role in human psychology. Lloyd then argues that the desire for self-preservation should not be treated as the sovereign desire in terms  of which all other desires must be understood.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\">Morality in the Philosophy of Thomas Hobbes</i> and Lloyd's first book, <i style=\"\">Ideals  as Interests in Hobbes's Leviathan</i>, are, I think, among the most exciting, most important, and most philosophically sophisticated  unified readings of Thomas Hobbes's moral and political theory. I recommend  these two books to all who are interested in contemporary Hobbes scholarship.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[5]</span></span></a></sup></p>    <div style=\"\">\r\n\

This may be especially appropriate  given that Lloyd ends the book by arguing for the contemporary relevance of  Hobbes's philosophical positions.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Traditionally -- and especially for the past two  generations -- Hobbes scholars have attributed to Hobbes a brutally simplistic  emotivism: being good just is being desired, and one has a reason to <span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\">j</span></span> just in case (more or less) <span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\">j</span></span>-ing  satisfies a desire. In light of this, one needn't -- and many haven't -- read Hobbes as an egoist. For, one can desire  other people's welfare. One would thereby see another's welfare as good and  therefore see promoting the other's welfare as a reason to act. So, Hobbes is no  egoist. But, even though one implausible result is avoided, the simple emotivism  most Hobbes scholars attribute to Hobbes is itself incredible. Consequently,  readers of the traditional interpretations of Hobbes may quite correctly lodge foundational objections on the basis of the absurdity of Hobbes's  purported meta-normative commitments. This is especially the case given that  Hobbes is a rigorously systematic theorist. By Hobbes's very own lights, if the  foundations of his theory are flawed, then the entire theory fails to get off the  ground. Those interested in Hobbes but uninterested in pure exegesis are thereby immediately driven to a reconstructive project like Gregory Kavka's:  develop a <i style=\"\">Hobbesian </i>moral and political theory while eschewing <i style=\"\">Hobbes's</i> moral and political theory.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The central claim of Lloyd's book is a response  to this kind of pessimism about Hobbes's moral and political theory, and it is a  truly audacious claim: Thomas Hobbes has a heretofore unrecognized and philosophically respectable meta-normative theory, a theory Lloyd calls  the <i style=\"\">reciprocity theorem of reason</i> (hereafter RT). The RT explains normativity in terms of certain inescapable demands  of agency and it gives the contents of practical reasons, and the contents  of the Laws of Nature in particular, by way of a construction procedure  involving idealized reciprocal judgments of blamelessness. In short, Lloyd argues  that Hobbes offers what we today call a constitutivist grounding of the  authority of reason and a constructivist theory of the content of morality. As I  said: Lloyd's reading of Hobbes is truly audacious.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The RT makes its appearance in an argument that  spins out what it means for a being to be a rational animal (pp. 219-220). First,  if a being is a rational animal, then it behaves in accordance with right  reason. This is not mere accidental conformity, but is instead a matter of  acting <i style=\"\">on </i>a practical reason. Lloyd leaves aside the question of how something acts on some consideration or other  -- Hobbes never discusses this question -- and instead focuses exclusively  on what sort of thing a practical reason is. Presumably, once that is spelled  out, it will be unproblematic to give an account of what it is to act on  practical reasons, which in turn will give us an account of what it is for a being  to be a rational animal. So all the work is done by the account of what it is  to be a practical reason. The RT supposedly does that work.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The RT as formally stated by Lloyd is as  follows:</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">If one judges  another's doing of an action to be without right, and yet does that action oneself, one  acts contrary to reason. . . . That is, to do what one condemns in another is contrary to reason. (p. 220, italics removed)</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Right off the bat, let us note that Lloyd  initially describes the RT as a <i style=\"\">constraint </i>on reason. This though is quite incorrect (Lloyd seems to recognize this  when she later explains that she is \"unfolding the conception of reason Thomas Hobbes takes to be the common understanding of his time, and the  conception underlying the natural law tradition that he insists he is  illuminating.\" [p. 223]). For, constraints on what reason can require cannot alone yield  fully determinate contents of reasons or, for that matter, rational  requirements. But, the RT <i style=\"\">is </i>supposed to yield just such fully determinate contents of reasons and the Laws of Nature. So,  the RT is more than a mere constraint; it is a substantive account of what  reason requires.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The basic idea behind the RT is that the  contents of practical reasons are determined primarily by the interaction of the  following things: a certain reactive attitude, namely blame, a consistency  requirement, and a consideration-action pair {R, \xCF\x86}. In particular, a consideration R in favor of \xCF\x86<span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\"></span></span>-ing is a <i style=\"\">reason </i>to \xCF\x86 if {R, \xCF\x86<span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\"></span></span>} can, without contradiction, be a part of a perfectly consistent practice  of not blaming people for \xCF\x86-ing for  the sake of R. If one sincerely blames some people for \xCF\x86-ing on the basis of R but (in all sincerity) does not blame others (e.g.,  like himself), then R is either not a reason to \xCF\x86 or, more likely, one is being criticizably inconsistent in not recognizing that others are  acting on legitimate reasons. We would distinguish between these two judgments as follows: if there is <i style=\"\">not</i> a perfectly consistent practice of not blaming people for \xCF\x86-ing for the sake of R, then R is not a reason to \xCF\x86; if there <i style=\"\">is</i> a perfectly consistent practice of not blaming people for \xCF\x86-ing for the sake of R, then one is being criticizably inconsistent.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Perhaps what is most initially striking about  this is the role that reactive attitudes play in this account. Lloyd is quite up  front about this: \"only one's own judgments of blameworthiness can provide one with reasons\" (p. 227). Although this retains certain features of the traditional emotivist reading of Hobbes, a reactive attitudes-based meta-normative theory is highly sophisticated. Consequently, this  reading of Hobbes may seem anachronistic to some Hobbes scholars (especially since  many may think that it strays quite far from the texts), but in my opinion  there is much about this reading that creatively and charitably captures the  spirit of the more familiar accounts of Hobbes's views.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">All this being said, the reactive attitudes are  not in fact what are at the heart of Lloyd's account of the RT. Lloyd writes  that one has \"nothing that counts as a reason at all unless it is a justifying consideration [one] would be willing not just to give to others but also  to accept from them as justifying their like conduct.\" (p. 227) Lloyd recognizes that the mere invocation of reactive attitudes is not enough  to keep a meta-normative theory of practical reason from collapsing into a kind  of subjectivism -- in this case actual dispositions to blame entirely  determining the content of practical reasons -- that has already been rejected as  overly simplistic. Charity, at least, requires that we read Hobbes as having  more to say about the source of practical reasons. And the consistency  requirement is that something more, for it blocks an utterly subjective and  consequently utterly implausible meta-normative theory. It does this by grounding  reasons to <span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\">j</span></span> not in <i style=\"\">actual</i> dispositions to blame, but instead in <i style=\"\">consistent </i>dispositions to blame. In particular, regardless of whether one is <i style=\"\">disposed</i>  to accept from another some consideration as rendering blameless (i.e., as justifying) that other person's action, so long as  one demands <i style=\"\">from </i>others that they treat that consideration as rendering blameless one's <i style=\"\">own </i>action,  one thereby commits oneself to accepting that consideration as a justification <i style=\"\">from </i>others. While this is not quite enough to generate a practical reason -- {R, \xCF\x86} must bear the appropriate rational connection with one another -- it is  this consistency requirement that does most of the theoretical heavy lifting.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">This is also from whence the reciprocity of the  RT comes. Reciprocity exists when some person, A, would both expect others to  accept R as justifying his own \xCF\x86-ing, <i style=\"\">and</i> would accept from others R as justifying <i style=\"\">their </i>own \xCF\x86-ing. But, Lloyd argues, so long as A expects others to accept R as justifying  his \xCF\x86-ing, consistency  requires that A accepts from others R as justifying their \xCF\x86-ing. Why? Apparently, according to Lloyd's Hobbes, this follows from the  nature of what it is for some consideration to be a reason. For, being a reason to \xCF\x86 cannot be indexed to a particular person; reasons by their very nature  apply to all who are in a certain situation. There can be no rational  haecceities, as it were. Thus, if A expects others to accept R as justifying his \xCF\x86-ing, then A must accept R as justifying others' \xCF\x86-ing.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Lloyd deploys one of Hobbes's examples to  effectively illuminate this point. Suppose A intends to invade B's country, for the  sake of R, namely to spread the one true religion. Is R a reason for A to invade  B? This depends upon whether A would accept from B an appeal to R as a justification for invading <i style=\"\">A's </i>country. Of course, if R is pitched in terms of spreading the one true religion  where the referent of \"one true religion\" is fixed by A's beliefs, then A might accept the reason. But, consistency requires A treating the  referent of \"one true religion\" as something B would accept (since B would deny that the religion A is spreading is the one true religion). So, whether R  is a reason for A to invade B's country depends upon whether A would accept  that B is blameless for invading A's country in order to spread what <i style=\"\">B </i>believes is the one true religion. Since A's invasion of B's country is premised upon B's religion not  being the one true religion, A could not accept that B is blameless for invading  A's own country to spread what <i style=\"\">B </i>believes is the one true religion. So, all else being equal, A does not have a  reason to invade B's country.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">All this is starting to sound suspiciously  Kantian -- or even Scanlonian. But not to worry. For, whether someone has a reason to \xCF\x86 depends partially on her occurrent attitudes: what she wants to do and  what she would offer as a justifying reason to others. RT is therefore a <i style=\"\">perspectival </i>theory of practical reason. The tempering provided by the consistency requirement generates only a  modest objectivity. Consequently, if B would never, ever offer R as a  justification for his \xCF\x86-ing, but  A would do so, then R is a reason to \xCF\x86 <i style=\"\">only</i> for A, and not for B.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Much more must be said -- and Lloyd offers a  very nice discussion at pp. 222-230 -- about how to formulate the  act-consideration pair that is then to be 'tested' by the RT. Space restrictions prevent me  from exploring Lloyd's discussion of this issue. A brief comment is worth  making though.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">As Lloyd rightly highlights, the problem of the formulation of the act-consideration pair is somewhat symmetrical to the problem of the formulation of the Kantian maxim that is tested by the Categorical Imperative. The problem distinctive to Hobbes, though, is  that there is no universally correct unique formulation of the  act-consideration pair (as there is in, e.g., the famous cases in Kant's <i style=\"\">Groundwork</i>).  The formulation depends upon the <i style=\"\">actual</i> attitudes of  the acting agent and, in a very interesting way, the actual attitudes of those with whom that agent interacts in  virtue of the action in question. The RT can also apply recursively if we treat as  an action the very application of an action-description when assessing  whether one is justified in action. Thus Lloyd writes:</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">we must each step  back a pace from the primary dispute and ask whether each is content to allow the  other to deliberate on the basis of that other's preferred action-description. If  so, and they are content to disagree, the reciprocity theorem allows that  each acts in accordance with reason in [e.g.,] seeking to impose his or her own  (as they see it, true) religion while condemning the other's attempt to impose  their different religion. If not, and each would fault the other for  arrogantly insisting upon his or her own action-description in this important and contested case, then the reciprocity theorem . . . will not permit those  who fault others for insisting on a contested action-description to insist  on their own contested action-description. (p. 225)<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Gathering these reflections together, let us  render the RT as follows:</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">(RT) Assuming A  intends to \xCF\x86<span style=\"font-family:Symbol;\"><span style=\"\"></span></span>  for the sake of R: R is a reason for A to \xCF\x86 iff a perfectly consistent A would not blame anyone for \xCF\x86-ing for R.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The RT is a <i style=\"\">constructivist </i>account of practical reason since it explains what counts as a  reason in terms of a suitably constructed subject's responses to actions on the  basis of certain considerations. If the constructed subject is not disposed to  blame someone performing that action for the sake of that consideration, then  insofar as someone takes that consideration to apply to her, then she has a  reason to act. This is not the twentieth-century's constructivism, which aims at a somewhat more robust universality than the RT's constructivism. But, it  is constructivism nonetheless.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The RT also amounts to what many today call <i style=\"\">constitutivism</i>.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup> Constitutivism is the view that the objective authority of moral norms  (and perhaps even value) can be grounded in norms or aims that are supposedly constitutive of human practical agency. The RT is constitutivist because  it is, itself, grounded in the nature of human rationality. The argument, given  at pp. 219-220 and partially summarized above, runs as follows:</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">1.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>Humans are rational beings.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">2.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>But what makes a being rational is  that it acts for reasons.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">3.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>In particular, what it is to <i style=\"\">act</i> as opposed merely to behave in a manner driven by one's desires and fears is to guide one's behavior by  way of appeal to reasons one takes oneself to have.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">4.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>But, behaving in light of the reasons  one takes oneself to have just is to act in a way that meets the standard  expressed by the RT.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">5.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>So, if humans are to act at all, they  must act in accordance with the RT.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">6.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>Humans are inescapably driven to act.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">7.<span style=\"\">     </span></span></span>So, humans are inescapably governed  by the RT: \"any agent whose actions are to accord with reason must regulate his own actions by the standards of judgment he applies to the actions of  others.\" (p. 248)</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The constitutive feature of Lloyd's account of  Hobbes's meta-normative theory receives short shrift in the text. But since she  argues that the authority of the Laws of Nature is grounded in the authority of  the RT, the question of what grounds the authority of the RT immediately  arises. Lloyd never asks this question, but it's because she seems to think that  once it is demonstrated that the RT follows from what it is to be a rational  being, the authority of the RT will be self-evident. Thus she writes: \"The reasonable is built into our conception of man as a rational animal from  the very beginning.\" (p. 233) But, if by \"the reasonable\" she means only \"the content of the laws of nature\" then she leaves Hobbes open to the obvious challenge: \"But why obey the laws of nature?\" Lloyd simply does not see this question as on the table. But of course it is!  And, if Lloyd fails to answer it, then the meta-normative theory she imputes to  Hobbes remains incomplete and unsatisfying. Fortunately, what Lloyd says Hobbes  is up to amounts to an attempt to answer the question, even though Lloyd  doesn't recognize the significance of what she herself is up to.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">In sum, we have a constructivist account of how  practical reasons get their contents and a constitutivist account of how practical reasons get their authority and all this pivots around the RT.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup> As I've already stated, this is, in light of the commonly accepted understanding of Hobbes, a very startling interpretation.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Let us now briefly consider Lloyd's  interpretation of how the contents of the Laws of Nature (LoN) follow from the RT (this  discussion is at pp. 234-247). The argument Lloyd sees in Hobbes, which can be found  at pp. 241-242, runs roughly as follows.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">A central concept for Hobbes is <i style=\"\">power</i>,  which is the ability to satisfy one's desires. The one necessary desire that all agents have, regardless of the content of any  of their other desires, is the desire for power. A necessary condition for  power is peace. Therefore, on pain of inconsistency, each person must treat  the desire for power as justification for seeking peace. So each person must  accept that every other person may blamelessly seek peace out of the desire for  power. That is, everyone has a practical reason to seek peace.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">But, this argument fails to establish an  obligation. For, there is a difference between demonstrating that everyone has a reason  to do something and demonstrating that there is a rational <i style=\"\">requirement</i>  that all people do something. And the Law of Nature is a rational requirement; it is <i style=\"\">not</i> merely a reason that all persons have. For, the LoN says that <i style=\"\">not </i>seeking peace (and if peace isn't available then not defending oneself) is <i style=\"\">irrational</i>. So, to show that the RT grounds the LoN, Lloyd must show how the RT  rules out <i style=\"\">ever </i>having a reason <i style=\"\">not </i>to  seek peace.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Notice, by the way, that the character who Lloyd  must demonstrate hasn't reasons not to seek peace isn't the glory-seeker. The  glory-seeker, who claims that the desire for glory is a reason not to seek peace,  could not accept from <i style=\"\">others</i> that they have this reason not to seek peace. For, the glory-seeker requires others to  stand in awe of him and to obey him. But, if these others have reasons to war  with him, then he doesn't have their awe. So, the glory-seeker would be  guilty of inconsistency if he insists that he has a reason not to seek peace.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The character who poses a problem for Lloyd's  derivation of the first LoN is the <i style=\"\">lover of chaos</i> (this is my own invention -- neither Hobbes nor Lloyd ever mentions this character). This person would offer her love of chaos as a justification  for not seeking peace. She would also happily accept from anyone else a  similar love as a legitimate justification for not seeking peace. For, others  not seeking peace would generate more beloved chaos. So, while the chaos  lover may have a reason to seek peace, she also can consistently recognize a  reason <i style=\"\">not </i>to seek peace. That is, she is not obligated to seek peace.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Lloyd must argue that the love of chaos could  never be a reason for action for anyone. This is tricky but I think Lloyd finds the resources in Hobbes for such an argument. The argument would look  something like the following. Being an agent essentially involves the desire not  to have one's power totally destroyed. Since action can only be the product of  agency, action presumes the desire not to have one's power totally destroyed.  So, desiring not to have power is tantamount to desiring not to act. So,  insofar as one acts, one desires not to have one's power totally destroyed. So, no  one could ever sincerely and without contradiction offer the desire not to  have any power as a justification for <i style=\"\">any </i>action. Chaos is the same as war and war is the absence of power. So, one can  never argue that her love of chaos (i.e., the desire for no power) is a reason  for <i style=\"\">any </i>action, even if that action is seeking war. I do not endorse this argument, but I think Lloyd's  interpretation of Hobbes allows Hobbes to make it in response to the chaos-lover. I  think that Lloyd's account of Hobbes's derivation of the LoN from the RT would be  stronger had she considered something like this argument.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The very narrow focus of this book review -- I  discuss almost exclusively the approximately fifty pages of Chapter Five -- is  not meant to suggest that there are not other fascinating and well-argued  features of this book. Lloyd's discussion of the self-effacing character of  natural law is innovative and the best analysis I've seen of Hobbes's account of the relationship between natural law and positive law. Her re-reading of  Hobbes's response to the Foole is also groundbreaking. In addition to these very substantial discussions late in the book, there are numerous other  significant observations that not only profoundly illuminate Hobbes's overall  normative project but that will also significantly change the landscape of Hobbes scholarship in analytic philosophy. For example, Lloyd rightly  highlights that Hobbes believed that the desire to justify oneself plays a central,  driving role in human psychology. Lloyd then argues that the desire for self-preservation should not be treated as the sovereign desire in terms  of which all other desires must be understood.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><i style=\"\">Morality in the Philosophy of Thomas Hobbes</i> and Lloyd's first book, <i style=\"\">Ideals  as Interests in Hobbes's Leviathan</i>, are, I think, among the most exciting, most important, and most philosophically sophisticated  unified readings of Thomas Hobbes's moral and political theory. I recommend  these two books to all who are interested in contemporary Hobbes scholarship.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[5]</span></span></a></sup></p>    <div style=\"\">\r\n\
