content: "<p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"\"><i>Spinoza's</i></span><span style=\"\"> <b><i>Ethics</i></b></span><span style=\"\"> is a recent addition to Cambridge's Introductions to Key Philosophical Texts, a series developed for the purpose of helping readers with no specific background knowledge to begin the study of important works of Western philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span>Steven Nadler accomplishes that aim admirably.<span style=\"\">  </span>He covers nearly every major position in the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\">, including very difficult topics that are often neglected in the literature but which often interest or puzzle readers of Spinoza, such as the distinction between mediate and infinite modes in Part 1 of the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\"> or the account of the eternal part of the mind in Part 5.<span style=\"\">  </span>He does so, moreover, using a number of different tools likely to make the book of interest to a variety of readers.<span style=\"\">  </span>The book includes a clear, concise biography of Spinoza.<span style=\"\">  </span>Nadler makes numerous comparisons to Descartes, who was Spinoza's most important influence as well as a figure that may be more familiar to many readers. Where it is appropriate, he also introduces other important influences on Spinoza, including Cicero, Maimonides, and Hobbes.<span style=\"\">  </span>He compares discussions in the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\"> to parallel discussions in Spinoza's other works, making especially good use of Spinoza's letters, which enlivens debate and allows Nadler to raise in the voice of Spinoza's correspondents questions that readers are likely to have themselves.<span style=\"\">  </span>And, in the course of discussing the issues that have been of greatest interest to Spinoza's critics, Nadler refers readers to some of the most important recent work on Spinoza by philosophers, historians. and political theorists.<span style=\"\">  </span>So readers with specific interests in metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, ethics, religion, politics, or history will find some hook here to draw them into the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\">.<span style=\"\">  </span>Nadler's book is comprehensive, engaging, and bright.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is sure to answer the questions that will strike a new reader of Spinoza and to raise new questions and productive lines of inquiry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"\">The book begins with an account of Spinoza's life.<span style=\"\">  </span>Nadler is the author of the best biography of Spinoza, <i>Spinoza: A Life </i></span><span style=\"\">(Cambridge University Press, 1999), and this essay summarizes his account there.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 2, a discussion of Spinoza's geometric method, includes a discussion of the formal apparatus of the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\">. The highlight of Chapter 2 is an extended discussion of Spinoza's theory of definition in the course of which Nadler argues that Spinoza's definitions in the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\"> ought to be understood as real rather than stipulative definitions.<span style=\"\">  </span>All of the subsequent chapters follow the order of argument of the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\">.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 3, \"On God: substance\" describes the argument to substance monism at 1p14 (that is, Part 1, Proposition 14) and Spinoza's identification of God with nature.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 4 concerns necessity and determinism.<span style=\"\">  </span>It includes a helpful discussion of the relation of Spinoza's \"God\" to traditional religious conceptions of God, something that does not interest many philosophical critics of Spinoza but which does continue, three centuries later, to raise eyebrows among undergraduate readers.<span style=\"\">  </span>In Chapter 5, after a brief discussion of Spinoza's parallelism -- the view that the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of extended things -- Nadler describes Spinoza's account of the human being and, in particular, the mind/body relation that Spinoza draws out of this central doctrine.<span style=\"\">  </span>Nadler makes extensive and apt use there of a comparison to Descartes.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 6, following along the structure of Part 2 of the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\">, focuses on epistemological themes: Spinoza's theory of ideas, his account of the three kinds of cognition at 2p40s2, and his identification of will and intellect at 2p49.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 7 summarizes Spinoza's accounts of desire and the passions.<span style=\"\">  </span>It emphasizes Spinoza's naturalism about human psychology and what Nadler characterizes as Spinoza's egoism.<span style=\"\">  </span>Here the main comparison is to Hobbes, whom Nadler also takes to be an egoist.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 8 is an account of some of the central themes of Spinoza's moral theory.<span style=\"\">  </span>One might emphasize any number of near equivalent concepts that Spinoza uses in Part 4 of the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\"> (the good, what reason commands, what is useful, what conduces to self-preservation).<span style=\"\">  </span>Nadler chooses to emphasize virtue and, what he rightly regards as a different kind of concept, Spinoza's model of human nature, the \"free man.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>The chapter also features a brief discussion of Spinoza's political philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span>Chapter 9 concerns, principally, Part 5 of the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\"> and Spinoza's use there of some of the terms of traditional eschatology, \"eternity\" and \"blessedness.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Drawing upon, especially, the medieval Jewish tradition, Nadler offers an interpretation of Spinoza as denying personal immortality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"\">Nadler takes few strong interpretative positions in his introduction to the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\">.<span style=\"\">  </span>On topics of debate among Spinoza scholars, he typically refers readers to other sources rather than entering into argument himself.<span style=\"\">  </span>For example, on the question of whether Spinoza's account of the free man amounts to an argument that everybody ought to try to live like the free man, Nadler (pp. 237-238) merely mentions the dispute and refers to papers by Edwin Curley and Don Garrett, which he takes to offer different views on the issue.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"\">Nevertheless, Nadler does, in a few places, defend particular interpretative views, and these parts of the book are likely to be of particular interest to specialists in the history of early modern philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span>In his introduction (p. 58) of Spinoza's notion of attribute, which Spinoza defines at 1d4 as what the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance, Nadler mentions an important dispute concerning whether attributes are to be understood subjectively, as a way in which what is real is perceived, or objectively, as themselves real features of the world.<span style=\"\">  </span>Later (pp. 129-130), after his discussion of parallelism, which gives the reader more detailed knowledge of two attributes, Nadler argues for an objectivist reading, on the grounds that: first, outside of the appearance of Spinoza's initial accounts of attributes, considered in isolation, there is little evidence for a subjectivist reading; and, second, Spinoza clearly argues (1p9) that the more reality a thing has the more attributes belong to it.<span style=\"\">  </span>The second point is one that Martial Gueroult also emphasizes, a debt that Nadler clearly acknowledges.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is a compact, efficient argument that, at the very least, puts the burden of evidence on a defender of the subjectivist interpretation to show how it is that, on Spinoza's view, just from being able to be perceived in a variety of different ways, one thing can be considered to be more real than another.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"\">In the philosophy of mind, Nadler defends (171-173) a particular account of what it is, on Spinoza's view, for a mind to be conscious.<span style=\"\">  </span>Traditionally, critics have either despaired of giving an account of consciousness in the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\"> or defended one of two interpretations.<span style=\"\">  </span>On the first option, which Nadler takes to have its principal source in Curley, Spinoza does not take ideas of body to be conscious, which is good if he can thereby save himself from making ordinary objects such as tennis balls, which have both mental and physical aspects, conscious.<span style=\"\">  </span>Spinoza does, however, on the first reading take ideas of ideas to be conscious.<span style=\"\">  </span>If it were true, on Spinoza's view, that only those things that we want to show to be conscious contained ideas of ideas, then the first option might be promising.<span style=\"\">  </span>Nadler argues, however, that Spinoza takes there to be an idea of every mode in every attribute.<span style=\"\">  </span>So, for a tennis ball, just as there is an idea corresponding to the extended tennis ball, so there is also an idea corresponding to the idea of the tennis ball.<span style=\"\">  </span>The first option, therefore, does not find consciousness precisely where we would like it to be.<span style=\"\">  </span>Nadler instead endorses the second option, which was entertained and rejected by Margaret Wilson and which Garrett recently has also entertained.<span style=\"\">  </span>On this option, it is the complexity of a mind that makes it conscious.<span style=\"\">  </span>Nadler helpfully defends the view that the human mind is complex, on Spinoza's account, by referring to the great complexity Spinoza finds in its extended counterpart, the human body.<span style=\"\">  </span>Then he concludes that, as the human body is extremely complex, so the mind is conscious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"\">The second option ought to be presented as one according to which some things are relatively more conscious than others, rather than in terms of what is or is not conscious, since anything, even a tennis ball, has some degree of complexity.<span style=\"\">  </span>So, according to this option, Spinoza is not saved entirely from attributing consciousness to tennis balls; he attributes to them a very confused and rudimentary kind of consciousness.<span style=\"\">  </span>This, of course, is a weakness of the view, and the grounds upon which Wilson rejects it.<span style=\"\">  </span>However, as Garrett has noted, it is also a strength for Spinoza insofar as it jibes well with Spinoza's naturalism in making the difference between human beings and tennis balls a difference in degree rather than in kind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"\">Nadler also takes an interesting position on the interpretation of Spinoza's remarks about the eternal part of the mind in Part 5, following 5p20.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is, as I have mentioned, a great strength of Nadler's book that he discusses those portions of the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\"> that many other commentators, because of their own lack of interest, do not.<span style=\"\">  </span>This will be a service to curious students of the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\"> who are regularly struck by Spinoza's claims about God, blessedness, and eternity.<span style=\"\">  </span>Another notable strength of the book, which I have not mentioned, is Nadler's ability to handle even very difficult and obscure parts of the book in a way that makes them accessible and invites readers to test interpretations where they might otherwise just be struck numb.<span style=\"\">  </span>Both of these strengths are evident at the end of the book, in Nadler's discussion of eternity.<span style=\"\">  </span>He rejects interpretations of Spinoza's account of the eternity of part of the mind as a kind of doctrine of personal immortality, arguing that neither consciousness nor memory survive the death of the body.<span style=\"\">  </span>Instead, Nadler sides with a line of interpretation on which Spinoza takes the eternal part of the mind to be a body of knowledge.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"\">A strength of the discussion is Nadler's account of Spinoza's strategy in defending this conception of eternity.<span style=\"\">  </span>Instead of taking Spinoza to offer an alternative account of eternal life -- as if the eternity of one's knowledge without consciousness or memory to enjoy it could be enticing -- Nadler (p. 271) presents Spinoza as engaged in an attempt to show why a life of freedom and reason is preferable to a life guided by passions.<span style=\"\">  </span>Traditional accounts of immortality, on this interpretation of Spinoza's view, depend upon hope and fear as motives for submission to ecclesiastic authority.<span style=\"\">  </span>In demonstrating that genuine eternal existence is not personal immortality, Spinoza, on Nadler's account, attempts to weaken the harmful influence of these passions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <span style=\"\">This is an excellent introduction to the <i>Ethics</i></span><span style=\"\">, which will appeal to readers from a variety of backgrounds and which, at the same time, makes a substantial contribution to Spinoza scholarship.<span style=\"\">  </span>While acknowledging difficulties and obscurities in Spinoza's work, Nadler provides an account of the whole book that captures Spinoza's insights into metaphysics, epistemology, psychology, and ethics and shows them all to be parts of a single body of argument.</span><span style=\"\"></span>"
