content: "\xE2\x80\x80<p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Michael Slote is best  known for his efforts to develop an ethics of care, but in this book he takes a detour into the history of  ethics to explore some country lanes running near his main road. The result is  an eclectic mix that is less a series of essays in the history of ethics  than the intelligent musing of an ethicist while reading historical primary  sources. Nevertheless, Slote's reflections offer some real insights, sometimes  into the philosophers he considers, but more often into the nature of moral  thought in general.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Slote arranges the essays chronologically by the philosopher under discussion, for no other reason than there is no other overarching theme to the book. So Slote winds his way through<b style=\"\">  </b>Greek ethics, Chinese ethics, Hume, Kant, utilitarianism, and the ethics of care. But he also includes a  very personal history of twentieth-century ethics that offers a unique perspective and  is simultaneously quite touching.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Slote's essays on the Greeks (chs. 1-3) advance  three ideas: \"elevationism,\" teleology, and the differences between ancient and modern thought. Of teleology, Slote claims that it is no longer a  viable thesis since its modern successor, consequentialism, does not accept a  key component of the view: the goal for which we must self-consciously aim.  Slote's distinction here is fine, but I think it an open question to what degree non-modern consequentialists really thought that we had to aim  consciously at the <i style=\"\">telos</i>. On the differences between ancient and modern ethics, Slote focuses neither on the modern tendency  to rely on guilt rather than shame as the central moral emotion nor on the  modern emphasis on individualism. Instead, he thinks the difference lies in  what Sidgwick called the \"duality of practical reason\": the difference between what is best for individuals and what is best for everyone. The  ancients, Slote claims, did not see a deep distinction between prudence and  morality, while moderns do. But again, this distinction is less important than  Slote thinks. While the ancients were intent to show that being moral was in everyone's best interest, they too saw the tension: Book I of the <i style=\"\">Republic</i> makes no sense unless ordinary people thought that justice often conflicted with their own  self-interest.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Much more interesting is Slote's idea of \"elevationism,\" which he proposes as the opposite of reductionism. If reductionist theories try to explain higher ethical concepts in terms of  lower ones like well-being and then try to explain well-being in terms of  natural properties like pleasure, then elevationist theories try to explain  lower concepts by means of higher ones. So, for example, the Stoics saw  well-being and personal good only in terms of virtues that they might exhibit. But Stoicism, Slote notes, is deeply unintuitive because it does not see  ordinary pleasures as part of our good or pains as evils. By contrast, Kant is a dualist, so that well-being and virtue are different and can not be  reduced into each other, with well-being representing a kind of sensibility and  virtue a kind of understanding. But Slote does not think we are forced to this  kind of dualism, and he wants to explore alternatives for elevationism.  Aristotle finds that pleasures gained through injustice do the person no good, and so he  thinks pleasures require a participation in virtue. But, Slote argues,  Aristotle implausibly claims that pleasures obtained through a vice are no part of  a good, so that stolen food can not contribute to his good. For that  reason, Slote thinks the most promising elevationist is Plato, who argues that a pleasure is good as long as a virtue in exhibited in the course of the enjoyment. So relationships are good because they require a concern for  others, achievement is good because it requires perseverance, and wisdom is good because it requires courage. Appetites, to be good, then, require  limitations, and they must be properly ordered before they can be a genuine good. The  details of Slote's characterization of Platonic elevationism need not concern us  here, except to note that Slote's interpretation, while inherently sketchy,  offers a new way to look at the project of ethics. He does not convince me -- or  even himself, I think -- that we should adopt elevationism as a theory, but  he makes it sound both plausible and attractive.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The middle of Slote's set of essays focuses on  the most prominent precursor to Slote's own form of sentimentalism: Hume. After a  brief foray into Chinese ethics in a review of Bryan van Norden's book that  argues for an affinity between important Chinese thinkers and Aristotle that  Slote think would be better compared to Hume (ch. 4), Slote offers two  substantive essays about Hume's moral theory that seek to show both why Hume's view  is generally correct and what needs to be done to make it better. In \"Hume  on Approval\" (ch. 5), Slote defends a notion of moral approval and disapproval that is suggested by Hume by showing how such approvals are possible without presupposing moral judgments. The answer, according to  both Hume and Slote, lies in empathy. For Hume, approval is a feeling that  arises when we empathize with the pleasures of other people, at least insofar  as it has been corrected to take out our own relationships so that we can have  a common moral language. But this view, Slote claims, does not enable us  to exclude our response to inanimate objects that cause harm to humans.  Hume's reply that the feeling is simply phenomenologically different is, Slote  rightly notes, inadequate -- even if Hume's defenders can, with some effort,  construct other ways to make the distinction. But Slote also claims that Hume's  view that the approvals are always pleasant feelings is wrong because we can give a grudging and phenomenologically unpleasant approval to a worthy  opponent. On this point, Slote is just mistaken: Hume agrees that as agents, we do  not feel pleasure at the approval to our archenemy, but the approval consists  only in the pleasure we have when contemplating our opponent's achievements from  a certain \"general\" point of view.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">According to Slote, Hume's main problem is that  he lacks a way to focus our approvals on moral agents. What he needs, Slote says  drawing on his own book, <i style=\"\">The Ethics of Care and Empathy</i>, is to focus on \"agential empathy\" (68): \"we empathize . . . <i style=\"\">with what they as (potential) agents are feeling and/or desiring</i>; and such empathy is  the core or basis of moral approval and disapproval\" (68). Moral approval, then, is based on the positive feelings we have when we empathize with  an agent who shows empathy for others; it is, then, \"empathy with [the standpoint of] <i style=\"\">agents</i>\" (68). We approve of those who empathize with others and disapprove of those who do not. His  view is based on what he calls the \"empathy-understanding hypotheses\": \"the idea that empathy enters into our understanding and making of  genuine moral claims\" (83). Such a view avoids Hume's problem, Slote argues, because we can not empathize with the response of inanimate objects to  others. In addition, Slote thinks this moves helps avoids the most important of  the standard criticisms of sentimentalism: the claim that it is circular,  because the feelings of approval themselves depend on moral judgments. To answer  it, sentimentalists need to be able to say what counts as positive and  negative features in their own terms. They must be able to argue that someone  with empathy will be moved toward the kinds of actions that others will  empathize with, and that tendency constitutes the positive aspect of it. Slote  suggests that this empathy can account for our intuitive judgments that favor  harms that are more visible to us and for those that correspond to our  deontological judgments. It also explains why morality is inherently motivating,  because the empathy involved in morality automatically carries some motivational  weight, and it explains why moral judgments are asymmetrical about self and  others, because we do not empathize with ourselves in the same way that we do  with others.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">However, this schema does not, by itself, solve  the circularity problem. On Slote's view, we are supposed to get a \"chill\" (78) when we empathize with an agent who responds cruelly to others. But when we empathize with the sadist, we could equally feel the pleasure, so Slote must give us reason to prioritize the feelings of the sadist's victims over those of the sadist himself. Hume tries to solve  the problem by having us empathize with everyone that an agent potentially  affects, with a special emphasis on those who are in the agent's \"narrow circle\" -- and Hume thinks we can make that judgment based just on the tendency of the agent's disposition, whether or not his cruelty causes  actual harm. But Hume seems to be counting on numbers here: the agent's cruelty  is likely to have bad effects on enough people to outweigh his own  pleasure. Slote's view can do better only if he can give a more convincing account  of the priority we give to the objects of cruelty. This concern does not  constitute a fatal objection to sentimentalism, but it needs something more than  Slote offers here to answer it.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">A different circularity problem is explored in  Slote's second essay on Hume, \"Hume on the Artificial Virtues\" (ch. 6) Hume's problem with justice is that he wants to accommodate our deontological intuitions in the way we treat justice as something inflexible, while  staying true to his sentimentalism. But that account is threatened with  circularity, Slote claims, because Hume thinks the artificial virtues are motivated  by our sense of obligation, but morality itself is supposed to be grounded in  the moral goodness of the motivations. Previous attempts to get Hume out of  the circle focus on our natural sentiments for self-interest or for the  public interest, and so it must show that our rigid attitude is required to get  the benefit. The artifice is then just a means to achieving justice, but  does not itself provide a justification. The problem is that justice sometimes  requires us to go against our self-interest or even against the public interest,  and so the rigidity can only be sustained, Slote argues, by an ignorance about  the real effects of a few deviations from simple rules. But even so, the  account does not, Slote claims, explain why we would morally approve of the  rigidity in situations in which we are better served by breaking those rules. So  Slote concludes that Hume's account of justice, as valuable as it is,  ultimately fails.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">What Slote misses in his criticisms of Hume's  account is precisely the <i style=\"\">social</i> nature of the conventions that are the basis of the artificial virtues. We can have exceptions to rules about promise keeping, as Slote acknowledges, only  when the exceptions are themselves general rules. But for artificial virtues,  those exceptions must themselves become <i style=\"\">socially</i> recognized as exceptions or the social utility of the institutions will  be undermined. There must be a rule or a process that allows the exception.  Such an attitude does not reduce the exceptions to \"whatever produces utility,\" since many instances that might increase utility cannot be set out in rules that people could actually use.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">Slote's last essay on the modern period is one  cheer for Kant (ch. 7). Even anti-Kantians like himself, Slote claims, must  recognize three important notions first found in Kant: (1) the categorical nature  of moral claims, (2) the distinction between what is good for a person and  what is a good state of affairs, and (3) the inward character of morality, the  idea that moral assessments depend only on an agent's intentions, keeping in  mind that agents are obliged to take due care to see that their intentions  are fulfilled. Slote is not mistaken to emphasize these points in Kant, but  he puts too much weight on Kant's originality, mostly because Slote simply  ignores the religious background to all of these positions. Kant's true originality  lies in the account of autonomy that Slote finds misguided.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">In the last three essays, Slote comes to terms  with more recent history. In two essays, he wants us to rethink the history of  ethics. In \"Reconfiguring Utilitarianism\" (ch. 8), he notes that while we used to regard utilitarianism as a truncated version of common-sense morality  that needed justification, we now see common-sense morality as a complex view compared to utilitarianism that must now itself be justified. The irony,  he thinks, is that this turnabout came because neo-Kantians like Rawls  tried to provide a justification for the deontological constraints of  common-sense morality, and so those constraints were no longer accepted as  self-evident. In \"Carol Gilligan and the History of Ethics\" (ch. 10), he shows that Gilligan's work on the different voices of ethics helps us to see the importance of some previously-neglected trends in the history of ethics,  like Christian agapism as well as the British sentimentalists. This new  history is also a deeper one, he thinks, since it gives a larger role to the story  of how we can come to adopt an ethics that does not clash with our sense of  ourselves in ordinary human terms.</p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\">The penultimate essay (ch. 9) is the most  personal. Through a discussion of the influences on his own philosophical thought,  Slote gives a history of late-twentieth century ethics: how Thomas Nagel and  Derek Parfit taught him the importance of theory, how Bernard Williams and Michael  Stocker added human and humane touches to morality and showed that a good life  is not about following rules, and how Carol Gilligan and Nel Noddings opened  his eyes to feminism and to different ways of seeing ethics. But he holds up two different philosophers as his most important influences: John Rawls,  who, besides offering the most important contributions to ethics in the  twentieth century, also made the practice of normative ethics respectable again;  and Philippa Foot, whom he regards as the most incisive philosopher he has  known and whose central insight -- that our values cannot simply be arbitrary  -- is now so widely accepted that her influence has become invisible.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup> The chapter is a fitting end to the collection, and the fact that it is  not the actual end is a testament to Slote's own desire to pay tribute to the  different voices found in Gilligan's work and to which his own work owes so much.</p>    \r\n  <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">      <sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_ednref\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\" font-family: &quot;&quot;;\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style=\" font-family: &quot;&quot;;\">  Rawls's influence is too well-known to add any more, but I <span class=\"footnormal\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;&quot;;\">will</span></span> add something to Slote's remarks about Foot. I met her as a graduate  student at a party in her honor after a lecture, and a couple of us began to probe  her thoughts about the classic issues about whether an unjust person could  be happy. As we talked, others at the party gradually joined the  conversation, until everyone present was literally sitting at her feet as she engaged  us all in a magnificently Socratic dialogue.</span>"
