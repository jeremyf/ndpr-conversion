content: "<p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">A comprehensive and systematic interpretation of Pyrrhonian scepticism as  it is presented in the works of Sextus Empiricus is probably not possible. His treatises are collections of a vast array of arguments stemming from  various sources from Pyrrhonian tradition and elsewhere, arguments that often  strongly differ in their strength and aims. The best known of these treatises, <i style=\"\">Outlines of Pyrrhonism</i>, is also not amenable to a fully coherent interpretation, as Casey Perin rightly  remarks in the \"Introduction\" of his book (5-6). So instead of offering a comprehensive interpretation of Sextus, he discusses several central  topics from the <i style=\"\">Outlines</i> -- such as the nature of sceptical investigation, the scope and character of the  suspension of judgement, and the problem of beliefs, appearances, and action -- that  have been the main bones of contention among scholars in the last decades. In  this short book, Perin has defended a well argued, clear, and challenging interpretation of some of the central aspects of Pyrrhonian scepticism.<span style=\"\">  </span>In this respect, <i style=\"\">The Demands of Reason</i>  is a major contribution to Sextus scholarship.<span style=\"\">  </span>At the same time, it shows that Sextus is still able to engage a contemporary reader.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Perin's main objective is to challenge the interpretation according to which the scepticism of the <i style=\"\">Outlines</i> can be characterized as a form of anti-rationalism. Some scholars have argued  that Sextus' sceptic abandons the search for truth once he has observed that  his ultimate goal, tranquillity, regularly follows upon suspension of  judgement. Moreover, it has been held that the sceptics' use of certain types of  argument, notably Agrippa's modes, commit them to the view that the search for  truth is futile. Thus Gisela Striker, one of the main proponents of such an interpretation, ascribes to the Pyrrhonists the view that \"there is no need to fall back on reason and argument in everyday life because all of  it can be conducted by following the appearances that come to us involuntarily, untainted by the influence of reason.\"<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a></sup> Perin wants to argue that such a view of Sextan scepticism fails to  capture its most important characteristics. He does not deny that reason has a  restricted role for the Pyrrhonists, but insists that it does have a role,  especially in that their central recommendation, that one should suspend judgement in  all matters, is guided by the aim to satisfy the demands of reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In Chapter 1 (\"The Search for Truth\") Perin discusses the character and aim of sceptical investigation. Sextus insists that, while other groups  of philosophers have announced that they have found the truth (positive dogmatists, like Epicureans or Stoics) or that the truth cannot be found (negative dogmatists, that is, Academics like Clitomachus and Carneades  and their followers), the sceptics are \"still investigating\" (<i style=\"\">Outlines  of Pyrrhonism</i> [<i style=\"\">PH</i>] 1.3). While Sextus is not  explicit about what exactly it is that the sceptics are investigating, Perin  argues that they are, like other philosophers, engaged in the search for truth. On  the other hand, however, there seem to be some reasons to think that the  search for truth is incompatible with the sceptics' position. For Sextus also says  that the goal of scepticism is the achievement of tranquillity, and he  defines scepticism as the ability to achieve tranquillity through suspension of judgement. So if the discovery of truth is just a means to achieving tranquillity, and, on the other hand, it appears to the sceptic that tranquillity regularly follows upon suspension of judgement, it seems  that the sceptic has every reason to abandon the search for truth, for even if it  is successful, it cannot achieve tranquillity. If this is so, then  scepticism cannot be seen as a kind of philosophy, contrary to what Sextus insists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Perin wants to argue that there is no real conflict here. The crucial question  is why the sceptic is interested in finding the truth in the first place. One  might get the impression that he is interested in truth merely as a means to tranquillity, that is, that the sceptic wants to know whether it is the  case that <i style=\"\">p</i> only because he wants to achieve tranquillity, i.e., eliminate the distress he feels because of  the ignorance concerning <i style=\"\">p</i>. Perin insists that this cannot be so. For the sceptic is distressed precisely because  he has an interest in knowing whether <i style=\"\">p</i> is the case, that is, because he has an interest in truth for its own sake.  Thus, an interest in truth for its own sake precedes and explains the  distress, and the desire to alleviate the distress is, in turn, the desire for  tranquillity. Perin argues that it is precisely because he has an interest in truth  for its own sake that the sceptic can take the discovery of truth as a means to achieving tranquillity. It follows, then, that the sceptic has an  interest in truth both for its own sake and as a means to tranquillity. The search  for truth, of course, presupposes that the truth can indeed be found, and  Perin shows that the sceptics' use of Agrippan strategy does not, contrary to  what is sometimes thought, commit them to the view that the truth cannot be  found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Perin's interpretation is convincing, elegant, and well argued. A possible  objection might be that he uses too restricted a notion of investigation.  Commenting on <i style=\"\">PH</i> 1.1-3, he says: \"In fact I doubt whether investigation can be understood as anything but the search for  truth, but I am claiming here only that investigation as Sextus understands it  -- the activity he claims the Sceptic is engaged in -- is the search for truth\" (8). While I agree that this may be the most natural reading of <i style=\"\">PH</i> 1.1-3, it seems to me that there is much more in Sextus' notion of investigation than the <i style=\"\">discovery</i>  of truth. For the sceptical investigation is also aimed at the avoidance of false beliefs (or, as the sceptics would put it, of precipitate assent), and includes the careful examination of dogmatic  theories; moreover, they also investigate whether there are such things as <i style=\"\">truth</i> and <i style=\"\">the true</i> (and argue that there  are no such things [<i style=\"\">PH</i> 2.80], or, alternatively, that we should suspend judgement about them [2.94]). So perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that sceptical investigations are guided by an  interest in truth in a more general sense, and not only by the interest in  discovering which of <i style=\"\">p</i> and not-<i style=\"\">p</i> is true. That is to  say, we may grant that the source of distress is the failure to know which of <i style=\"\">p</i>  and not-<i style=\"\">p</i> is true, so that the sceptics embark upon  investigation because they have an interest in truth for its own sake, but perhaps we should  leave open which truth-related value is such that it can be expected to remove  the distress. The desire to discover the truth may be the sceptics' original motive; but as their investigation progresses, they may become aware  that there are many more truth-related values they want to satisfy for their own  sake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Perin argues that in the <i style=\"\">Outlines</i> we can find an argument that is in tension with the view that discovery of  truth is a means to achieving tranquillity. This is the value argument, as he calls  it, according to which the source of distress is not ignorance, but any <i style=\"\">belief</i> about the goodness or badness of something, from which it follows that \"discovering the truth about the value of something is an obstacle, not a means, to tranquillity. For, obviously, to discover the truth about the value of something is to come  to know, and hence to believe, either that it is good or that it is bad\" (25). So if the source of distress is, as Sextus argues, the belief that  some things are good or bad, then, if a person believes that <i style=\"\">x</i>  is good, she must, to remove the distress, eliminate this belief, and not discover the truth. I agree that the value argument can be seen  as a deviation with respect to the rest of the <i style=\"\">Outlines</i>, but it seems to me that things are perhaps more complicated. A person  may believe that <i style=\"\">x</i> is good and feel distressed because of this, but, if she has an interest in truth both  for its own sake and as a means to tranquillity, she may believe that in this  case, too, an investigation guided by her interest in truth will remove the  distress. So she may set out to examine whether the proposition that <i style=\"\">x</i>  is good is indeed worthy of assent and discover that the criteria for the application of the term \"good\" are so confused that, after scrutiny, her assent to the proposition that <i style=\"\">x</i> is good  turns out to be an instance of a precipitate assent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In Chapter 2 (\"Necessity and Rationality\") Perin addresses the character of the sceptics' suspension of judgement. Sextus often writes that  suspension is a matter of necessity, i.e., that the fact that the conflict between candidates for belief is equipollent compels one to suspend judgement.  Perin describes this kind of necessity as causal or psychological necessity:  it appears to the sceptic that a psychological state of one type (the  appearance of conflict and equipollence) causes a psychological state of another  type (suspension). Taken in this sense, suspension is something that is  entirely passive. Perin does not deny that the necessity attached to the  sceptic's suspension is causal, but insists that this cannot be the whole story.  For Sextus not only says that one is compelled or forced to suspend  judgement but he also says that in certain situations the dogmatist will <i style=\"\">immediately  concede</i> that it is necessary to suspend judgement (<i style=\"\">PH</i>  2.19), or that it is <i style=\"\">right</i> to suspend judgement (2.96).  This suggests that the necessity involved in suspension is not just causal.  Perin describes it as a kind of hypothetical necessity: it is necessary for  sceptics or dogmatist sto suspend judgement <i style=\"\">if</i> they want to satisfy certain rational requirements. The relevant  rational requirement in the case of the dogmatists is<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">(SJ) Rationality requires one to suspend judgement about whether <i style=\"\">p</i> if one believes there is no reason to believe either <i style=\"\">p</i> or its  negation (40),<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">while the rational requirement the sceptics want to satisfy is<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">(SJ*) Rationality requires one to suspend judgement about whether <i style=\"\">p</i> if it appears to one that there is no reason to believe either <i style=\"\">p</i>  or its negation (43),<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">where \"appears\" should be taken non-doxastically, which means that by saying that it appears to him that <i style=\"\">p</i> the sceptic does not attribute to himself the belief that <i style=\"\">p</i>.  Thus both the dogmatists and the sceptics aim to satisfy the demands of reason, which is to be expected, given that they are both  engaged in the rational activity of searching for truth. We might ask what (SJ*)  has to do with rationality, since it is stated in terms of what (non-doxastically) appears to one to be the reason for belief. Perin's answer is that (SJ)  and (SJ*) are instances of general requirements of rationality with respect  to <i style=\"\">belief</i>, and, as such, they say only that we should not have a belief \"that conflicts with the attitude that controls the formation, retention, and revision of that belief\" (44).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Now, there are a variety of other ways in which Sextus announces suspension  as a conclusion of sceptical arguments: he not only says that one must  suspend judgement or that it is right to do so but he also says that one \"arrives\" at suspension (1.8, 1.91) and \"concludes\" to it (1.35, 1.123, 3.49), that it is \"introduced\" (1.117), that it \"follows\" (1.166), etc. What should we make of these cases? Perin tackles this question very briefly (p. 47, n. 24), and says that such descriptions are neutral with regard to whether the manner in which  suspension follows is a matter of causal or hypothetical necessity. It seems to me, however, that at least some of these cases give support to the  hypothetical interpretation. Take, for instance, the conclusion of Aenesidemus'  fourth mode, where Sextus says that \"the suspension of judgement about external existing objects is introduced (<i style=\"\">eisagetai</i>)\" (1.117). Reasoning leading to this conclusion seems to me to have  basically the same structure as the argument in 3.34-6, where Sextus, according to  Perin, relies on (SJ) or (SJ*). Let me also note that <i style=\"\">PH</i> 2.253  may be taken as a clear example, not discussed by Perin, of a dogmatist (Chrysippus) who must suspend judgement if he wants to  satisfy (SJ).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 3 (\"The Scope of Scepticism\") turns to one of the most discussed topics in recent scholarship, the problem of the sceptics' beliefs.  While Sextus insists that the sceptics suspend judgement about everything,  which suggests that they have absolutely no beliefs, he nevertheless puts the restriction on the scope of scepticism and says that the sceptics do  have some beliefs (<i style=\"\">dogmata</i>), if belief is taken just as acquiescing in something, i.e., as an assent to the affection  forced upon one in accordance with an appearance. The question is, what kind of  mental state this is and whether we can call it \"belief\" in the standard sense. Perin's suggestion is that the beliefs the sceptics have -- or non-dogmatic beliefs, as he calls them -- are beliefs about how things  appear to them, while beliefs they lack -- or dogmatic beliefs -- are beliefs  about how things are. While this solution is not novel, Perin supports it by a  very clear argument and persuasive interpretation of the central passage (<i style=\"\">PH</i> 1.13). He also offers a detailed criticism of an alternative and influential view proposed by Michael  Frede.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Now, if <i style=\"\">dogmata</i>  that the sceptics admit are <i style=\"\">dogmata</i> about how things  appear to them, then the question arises: does this mean that they have beliefs in the  standard sense of that term? While it may be controversial what exactly is  included in having a belief, it seems obvious that to believe <i style=\"\">p</i> is  to take <i style=\"\">p</i> to be true. Some commentators have rejected this and insisted that the  sceptics' beliefs, as opposed to the dogmatists' beliefs, do not include accepting  a proposition as true.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup>  Others have endorsed the standard account, but claimed that, as it was the common  view among the ancient philosophers that the reports about how things appear  do not have a truth value, they could not think that there are beliefs about  how things appear.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup>  Perin rejects both lines of interpretation: he argues both that non-dogmatic  belief includes accepting a proposition as true and that it is a genuine  belief. His main piece of evidence is <i style=\"\">PH</i> 1.215, where Sextus reports that someone has identified scepticism with  Cyrenaicism because they both claim that we apprehend (<i style=\"\">katalambanesthai</i>) only our own affections (<i style=\"\">path\xC4\x93</i>), which suggests, according to him, that the sceptics have knowledge of  what appears to them. He further suggests that<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">if, as Sextus claims, the Sceptic has knowledge of how things appear to him, and if belief is a constituent of  knowledge, then he has beliefs about how things appear to him. But it is difficult to  see how it is possible for the Sceptic (or anyone else) to believe <i style=\"\">p</i>,  and in doing so <i style=\"\">to know p</i>, without accepting <i style=\"\">p</i> as true. (69)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">I am not certain, however, that the standard distinction between knowledge and  belief applies in this case. The Cyrenaics take beliefs about their own <i style=\"\">path\xC4\x93</i> as infallible and incorrigible,<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup> and the same can be said about the sceptics' beliefs about how things  appear: they do not admit of being false. In this respect, the sceptical <i style=\"\">dogma</i> is more like knowledge than like belief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">One of the main functions commonly attributed to belief is to guide our  actions. However, when he argues against the famous <i style=\"\">apraxia</i> objection -- which says, roughly, that scepticism is incompatible with  action -- Sextus does not appeal to sceptical <i style=\"\">dogmata</i>. As Perin shows in Chapter 4 (\"Appearances and Action\"), he is right in not doing so, for beliefs about how things appear to one cannot guide  one's actions. Sextus argues instead that the explanation of actions should be  given in terms of appearances. In Perin's account,</span></p><p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"></p><blockquote>The explanation of any action the Sceptic performs will have the form <span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">S</span> does action <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A</span> because he desires to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\xCF\x86</span> and it appears to him that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">p</span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span> where <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">p</span> is, typically, a complex proposition that relates the doing of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A</span> to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\xCF\x86</span>-ing and so to the satisfaction of the desire to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\xCF\x86</span>. For example, the Sceptic drinks a glass of water because he is thirsty, i.e., has a desire to drink, and it appears to the Sceptic that there is a glass of water in front of him and that he can drink it.  The appearance to which the explanation of the Sceptic<span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span>s action appeals is not a belief, but it is an analogue to belief in the sense that it plays the role in the explanation of the Sceptic<span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span>s actions that belief plays in the explanation of the non-Sceptic<span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span>s actions. (96-7)</blockquote>\r\n\

  <p></p>    <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Things are, however, somewhat more complicated, as Perrin shows, primarily  because Sextus does not make it clear how an appearance is different from a belief.<span style=\"\">  </span>In any case, it would be wrong to conclude that, because the sceptics are guided by appearances  rather than by beliefs, they want to entirely reject reason.<span style=\"\">  </span>On  the contrary, their appeal to appearances is the result of their attempt to satisfy the requirements of reason: </span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"In this way the restriction  placed on the role of reason in the Sceptic's life is a restriction reason places on itself</span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> (117-8).</span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>\r\n\

So perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that sceptical investigations are guided by an  interest in truth in a more general sense, and not only by the interest in  discovering which of <i style=\"\">p</i> and not-<i style=\"\">p</i> is true. That is to  say, we may grant that the source of distress is the failure to know which of <i style=\"\">p</i>  and not-<i style=\"\">p</i> is true, so that the sceptics embark upon  investigation because they have an interest in truth for its own sake, but perhaps we should  leave open which truth-related value is such that it can be expected to remove  the distress. The desire to discover the truth may be the sceptics' original motive; but as their investigation progresses, they may become aware  that there are many more truth-related values they want to satisfy for their own  sake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Perin argues that in the <i style=\"\">Outlines</i> we can find an argument that is in tension with the view that discovery of  truth is a means to achieving tranquillity. This is the value argument, as he calls  it, according to which the source of distress is not ignorance, but any <i style=\"\">belief</i> about the goodness or badness of something, from which it follows that \"discovering the truth about the value of something is an obstacle, not a means, to tranquillity. For, obviously, to discover the truth about the value of something is to come  to know, and hence to believe, either that it is good or that it is bad\" (25). So if the source of distress is, as Sextus argues, the belief that  some things are good or bad, then, if a person believes that <i style=\"\">x</i>  is good, she must, to remove the distress, eliminate this belief, and not discover the truth. I agree that the value argument can be seen  as a deviation with respect to the rest of the <i style=\"\">Outlines</i>, but it seems to me that things are perhaps more complicated. A person  may believe that <i style=\"\">x</i> is good and feel distressed because of this, but, if she has an interest in truth both  for its own sake and as a means to tranquillity, she may believe that in this  case, too, an investigation guided by her interest in truth will remove the  distress. So she may set out to examine whether the proposition that <i style=\"\">x</i>  is good is indeed worthy of assent and discover that the criteria for the application of the term \"good\" are so confused that, after scrutiny, her assent to the proposition that <i style=\"\">x</i> is good  turns out to be an instance of a precipitate assent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In Chapter 2 (\"Necessity and Rationality\") Perin addresses the character of the sceptics' suspension of judgement. Sextus often writes that  suspension is a matter of necessity, i.e., that the fact that the conflict between candidates for belief is equipollent compels one to suspend judgement.  Perin describes this kind of necessity as causal or psychological necessity:  it appears to the sceptic that a psychological state of one type (the  appearance of conflict and equipollence) causes a psychological state of another  type (suspension). Taken in this sense, suspension is something that is  entirely passive. Perin does not deny that the necessity attached to the  sceptic's suspension is causal, but insists that this cannot be the whole story.  For Sextus not only says that one is compelled or forced to suspend  judgement but he also says that in certain situations the dogmatist will <i style=\"\">immediately  concede</i> that it is necessary to suspend judgement (<i style=\"\">PH</i>  2.19), or that it is <i style=\"\">right</i> to suspend judgement (2.96).  This suggests that the necessity involved in suspension is not just causal.  Perin describes it as a kind of hypothetical necessity: it is necessary for  sceptics or dogmatist sto suspend judgement <i style=\"\">if</i> they want to satisfy certain rational requirements. The relevant  rational requirement in the case of the dogmatists is<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">(SJ) Rationality requires one to suspend judgement about whether <i style=\"\">p</i> if one believes there is no reason to believe either <i style=\"\">p</i> or its  negation (40),<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">while the rational requirement the sceptics want to satisfy is<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">(SJ*) Rationality requires one to suspend judgement about whether <i style=\"\">p</i> if it appears to one that there is no reason to believe either <i style=\"\">p</i>  or its negation (43),<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">where \"appears\" should be taken non-doxastically, which means that by saying that it appears to him that <i style=\"\">p</i> the sceptic does not attribute to himself the belief that <i style=\"\">p</i>.  Thus both the dogmatists and the sceptics aim to satisfy the demands of reason, which is to be expected, given that they are both  engaged in the rational activity of searching for truth. We might ask what (SJ*)  has to do with rationality, since it is stated in terms of what (non-doxastically) appears to one to be the reason for belief. Perin's answer is that (SJ)  and (SJ*) are instances of general requirements of rationality with respect  to <i style=\"\">belief</i>, and, as such, they say only that we should not have a belief \"that conflicts with the attitude that controls the formation, retention, and revision of that belief\" (44).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Now, there are a variety of other ways in which Sextus announces suspension  as a conclusion of sceptical arguments: he not only says that one must  suspend judgement or that it is right to do so but he also says that one \"arrives\" at suspension (1.8, 1.91) and \"concludes\" to it (1.35, 1.123, 3.49), that it is \"introduced\" (1.117), that it \"follows\" (1.166), etc. What should we make of these cases? Perin tackles this question very briefly (p. 47, n. 24), and says that such descriptions are neutral with regard to whether the manner in which  suspension follows is a matter of causal or hypothetical necessity. It seems to me, however, that at least some of these cases give support to the  hypothetical interpretation. Take, for instance, the conclusion of Aenesidemus'  fourth mode, where Sextus says that \"the suspension of judgement about external existing objects is introduced (<i style=\"\">eisagetai</i>)\" (1.117). Reasoning leading to this conclusion seems to me to have  basically the same structure as the argument in 3.34-6, where Sextus, according to  Perin, relies on (SJ) or (SJ*). Let me also note that <i style=\"\">PH</i> 2.253  may be taken as a clear example, not discussed by Perin, of a dogmatist (Chrysippus) who must suspend judgement if he wants to  satisfy (SJ).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Chapter 3 (\"The Scope of Scepticism\") turns to one of the most discussed topics in recent scholarship, the problem of the sceptics' beliefs.  While Sextus insists that the sceptics suspend judgement about everything,  which suggests that they have absolutely no beliefs, he nevertheless puts the restriction on the scope of scepticism and says that the sceptics do  have some beliefs (<i style=\"\">dogmata</i>), if belief is taken just as acquiescing in something, i.e., as an assent to the affection  forced upon one in accordance with an appearance. The question is, what kind of  mental state this is and whether we can call it \"belief\" in the standard sense. Perin's suggestion is that the beliefs the sceptics have -- or non-dogmatic beliefs, as he calls them -- are beliefs about how things  appear to them, while beliefs they lack -- or dogmatic beliefs -- are beliefs  about how things are. While this solution is not novel, Perin supports it by a  very clear argument and persuasive interpretation of the central passage (<i style=\"\">PH</i> 1.13). He also offers a detailed criticism of an alternative and influential view proposed by Michael  Frede.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Now, if <i style=\"\">dogmata</i>  that the sceptics admit are <i style=\"\">dogmata</i> about how things  appear to them, then the question arises: does this mean that they have beliefs in the  standard sense of that term? While it may be controversial what exactly is  included in having a belief, it seems obvious that to believe <i style=\"\">p</i> is  to take <i style=\"\">p</i> to be true. Some commentators have rejected this and insisted that the  sceptics' beliefs, as opposed to the dogmatists' beliefs, do not include accepting  a proposition as true.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[2]</span></span></a></sup>  Others have endorsed the standard account, but claimed that, as it was the common  view among the ancient philosophers that the reports about how things appear  do not have a truth value, they could not think that there are beliefs about  how things appear.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[3]</span></span></a></sup>  Perin rejects both lines of interpretation: he argues both that non-dogmatic  belief includes accepting a proposition as true and that it is a genuine  belief. His main piece of evidence is <i style=\"\">PH</i> 1.215, where Sextus reports that someone has identified scepticism with  Cyrenaicism because they both claim that we apprehend (<i style=\"\">katalambanesthai</i>) only our own affections (<i style=\"\">path\xC4\x93</i>), which suggests, according to him, that the sceptics have knowledge of  what appears to them. He further suggests that<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">if, as Sextus claims, the Sceptic has knowledge of how things appear to him, and if belief is a constituent of  knowledge, then he has beliefs about how things appear to him. But it is difficult to  see how it is possible for the Sceptic (or anyone else) to believe <i style=\"\">p</i>,  and in doing so <i style=\"\">to know p</i>, without accepting <i style=\"\">p</i> as true. (69)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">I am not certain, however, that the standard distinction between knowledge and  belief applies in this case. The Cyrenaics take beliefs about their own <i style=\"\">path\xC4\x93</i> as infallible and incorrigible,<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">[4]</span></span></a></sup> and the same can be said about the sceptics' beliefs about how things  appear: they do not admit of being false. In this respect, the sceptical <i style=\"\">dogma</i> is more like knowledge than like belief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">One of the main functions commonly attributed to belief is to guide our  actions. However, when he argues against the famous <i style=\"\">apraxia</i> objection -- which says, roughly, that scepticism is incompatible with  action -- Sextus does not appeal to sceptical <i style=\"\">dogmata</i>. As Perin shows in Chapter 4 (\"Appearances and Action\"), he is right in not doing so, for beliefs about how things appear to one cannot guide  one's actions. Sextus argues instead that the explanation of actions should be  given in terms of appearances. In Perin's account,</span></p><p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"></p><blockquote>The explanation of any action the Sceptic performs will have the form <span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">S</span> does action <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A</span> because he desires to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\xCF\x86</span> and it appears to him that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">p</span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span> where <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">p</span> is, typically, a complex proposition that relates the doing of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A</span> to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\xCF\x86</span>-ing and so to the satisfaction of the desire to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\xCF\x86</span>. For example, the Sceptic drinks a glass of water because he is thirsty, i.e., has a desire to drink, and it appears to the Sceptic that there is a glass of water in front of him and that he can drink it.  The appearance to which the explanation of the Sceptic<span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span>s action appeals is not a belief, but it is an analogue to belief in the sense that it plays the role in the explanation of the Sceptic<span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span>s actions that belief plays in the explanation of the non-Sceptic<span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">'</span>s actions.

  <p></p>    <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Things are, however, somewhat more complicated, as Perrin shows, primarily  because Sextus does not make it clear how an appearance is different from a belief.<span style=\"\">  </span>In any case, it would be wrong to conclude that, because the sceptics are guided by appearances  rather than by beliefs, they want to entirely reject reason.<span style=\"\">  </span>On  the contrary, their appeal to appearances is the result of their attempt to satisfy the requirements of reason: </span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"In this way the restriction  placed on the role of reason in the Sceptic's life is a restriction reason places on itself</span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> (117-8).</span><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=\"NDPRBodyTexT\"><span style=\"\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>\r\n\
