content: "<p> As MacBeth puts it in the Preface, her aim in this book is \xE2\x80\x9Cto develop a novel reading of Frege\xE2\x80\x99s logical language Begriffsschrift and to defend that reading textually as a reading of Frege\xE2\x80\x99s writings\xE2\x80\x9D (vii). She rejects the widespread assumption that Frege is (one of) the discoverer(s) of modern polyadic quantificational logic, by arguing \xE2\x80\x9Cthat Frege\xE2\x80\x99s logical language ... can ... be read as ... radically different\xE2\x80\x9D from \xE2\x80\x9Ca language of quantificational logic\xE2\x80\x9D (vii). Although MacBeth doesn\xE2\x80\x99t put it in this way, on her alternative reading Frege was engaged in an expressivist and inferentialist project similar in spirit to the one recently articulated by Robert Brandom. Since it\xE2\x80\x99s always philosophically salutary to be made aware of and to re-examine one\xE2\x80\x99s fundamental assumptions, it is useful for anyone interested in Frege\xE2\x80\x99s views, or in the nature of logic, to confront MacBeth\xE2\x80\x99s challenge to the orthodoxy even if, like me, one finds it not altogether clear what MacBeth\xE2\x80\x99s case amounts to, and even if what one can understand of it is ultimately unpersuasive.</p> \n\
  <p>I will first give an outline of MacBeth\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation, omitting details that I don\xE2\x80\x99t take to contribute to the main argument, and then examine more closely her principal exegetical theses.</p> To read the entire review, <a href=\"**VERIFY**\">please download the PDF version of this review</a>."
