content: "<p>Franz Brentano remains one of the most underappreciated figures in the development of twentieth century philosophy. Indeed, Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cinvisibility\xE2\x80\x9D among contemporary analytic and continental philosophers has been a topic of much recent discussion and lament among Brentano scholars, some of whom have even gone so far as to propose a label for it (\xE2\x80\x9CThe Brentano Puzzle\xE2\x80\x9D).<sup><a name=\"1b\" href=\"#1\">1</a></sup> While contemporary specialists in logic or ethics may enjoy some familiarity with Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s contributions to their disciplines, mainstream analytic philosophers are likely to know of him primarily or even exclusively for his revival of the Aristotelian-Scholastic intentionality thesis, the thesis that all and only mental phenomena are characterized by a relation to or directedness upon an in-existent object. Yet the broader psychological project out of which this thesis arose, and the interpretive variants that it spawned among Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s students remain for the most part little-known and poorly understood. Contemporary continental philosophers know of Brentano primarily as the \xE2\x80\x9Cteacher of Husserl\xE2\x80\x9D. In this role, he is praised for having seen his way through to the intentionality of the mental but is criticized for having been unable to capitalize on the broader implications of this discovery for a truly phenomenological philosophy. Yet the extent of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s contributions, both substantive and methodological, to phenomenology is far wider than is typically supposed. As David Bell has recently argued, phenomenology\xE2\x80\x99s Brentanian inheritance includes aspects of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s overall vision of philosophy\xE2\x80\x99s nature, methods, and goals, as well as elements of his more specific doctrines concerning \xE2\x80\x9Cphenomena, intuitions, presentations, judgments, consciousness, intentionality, meaning, language, logic, science, truth, certainty, evidence, and analysis\xE2\x80\x9D.<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> </p>  \n\
  <p>Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s philosophical and psychological studies formed the core of a broad school of Austrian philosophy, a school that employed a distinctive empiricist methodology in opposition to what Brentano and his followers took to be the metaphysical extravagances of nineteenth century German idealism and romanticism. Brentano insisted that the true approach to philosophy must be a \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D one, grounded in the self-evident data of immediate perception and committed to high ideals of clarity, precision, and conceptual rigor. Blending a deeply metaphysical orientation with the epistemological starting points of an empirical psychology, Brentano undertook ambitious descriptive examinations aimed at providing a rigorous grounding for \xE2\x80\x9C[l]ogic, aesthetics, ethics, pedagogy, politics, and practical dependence,\xE2\x80\x9D and gaining insights into \xE2\x80\x9Cthe question of immortality, the comprehension of God in analogy to the soul, [and] the concepts of cause and effect (ends and means).\xE2\x80\x9D<sup><a name=\"3b\" href=\"#3\">3</a></sup> </p>  \n\
  <p>The contributions to this impressive volume help to combat some of the currently reigning misperceptions about Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s relationship to contemporary analytic philosophy, while filling in some of the lesser-known details concerning his relationship to Husserl and the phenomenological tradition. Beyond this, however, the volume reveals a thinker of surprising range and depth, one who made significant contributions to a wide variety of traditional metaphysical, logical, epistemological, ethical, psychological, and theological issues. The editor, Dale Jacquette, has assembled a solid collection of topically oriented essays that examine Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s work in all of these areas. Appropriately, the intentionality thesis remains at the center of the discussion, and is explored in depth in five of the contributions and treated at least in passing in nearly all. In addition to the topically oriented essays that make up the bulk of the volume, three additional contributions explore the influences on Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thinking and his subsequent influence upon later thinkers.</p>  \n\
  <p>The volume fills a significant and longstanding gap in the English-language literature on Brentano. With the exception of Victor Vellarde\xE2\x80\x99s cursory <i>On Brentano</i> it is the only volume in English that even <i>aims</i> to survey Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy as a whole.<sup><a name=\"4b\" href=\"#4\">4</a></sup> It must be admitted, however, that the volume is not one that will be accessible in all of its aspects to the generalist or to those approaching Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thought for the first time. Several of the essays are quite technical and take their bearings from scholarly disputes that will be obscure or of little interest to the non-specialist. That said, the essays by Jacquette, Kevin Mulligan, Charles Parsons, Wilhelm Baumgartner and Lynn Pasquerella, and Susan Krantz Gabriel are among the most accessible.</p>  \n\
  <p>Jacquette\xE2\x80\x99s centerpiece essay on \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano\xE2\x80\x99s concept of intentionality\xE2\x80\x9D provides a fine starting point for those new to Brentano, and especially for those whose familiarity with his work does not extend beyond his intentionality thesis. The contributions by Arkadiusz Chrudzimski and Barry Smith, Kevin Mulligan, Joseph Margolis, and Linda McAlister provide further discussion of the intentionality thesis and the interpretive difficulties it presents. Jacquette nimbly navigates the interpretive thickets surrounding the early version of the thesis that Brentano presents in his 1874 <i>Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint</i>. Jacquette rightly emphasizes that by intentional in-existence of an object, Brentano means here the literal containment of the intended object within the intending act (as a part within a whole) and not, as is often supposed, the (possible or actual) non-existence of the intended object. Much of the essay is devoted to an exploration of the counterintuitive metaphysical consequences that arise if this thesis is taken seriously, and of the variants proposed by H\xC3\xB6fler, Meinong, Twardowski, Husserl and in Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s own post-1905 \xE2\x80\x9Creist\xE2\x80\x9D doctrine (the doctrine that only particular physical objects exist). Jacquette argues convincingly that it was precisely the metaphysical difficulties latent in Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s early intentionality thesis that motivated his followers to undertake their own competing and in some cases highly fruitful investigations of intentionality.</p>  \n\
  <p>In light of its problematic metaphysical consequences, it might be wondered why Brentano adopted his early immanentist reading of the intentionality thesis. Jacquette argues, correctly in my estimation, that Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s descriptive psychological approach committed him to undertaking a study of the intentional character of mental acts that sought to sidestep metaphysical questions about the status of intentional objects. This is an important point that has often been missed by interpreters of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s intentionality thesis. Further, it is a point that can be fully appreciated only if the distinctive methodological character of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s descriptive psychological approach is understood (I shall say more about this below). In their contribution on Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s ontology, Arkadiusz Chrudzimski and Barry Smith are unwilling to excuse this neglect of metaphysics and ontology. While they concede that Brentano may have intended at the time that his early intentionality thesis be read as devoid of ontological commitments, \xE2\x80\x9C[i]n light of the way Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of intentionality developed after the <i>Psychology</i> . . . the reference to such immanent objects must be interpreted as signifying the introduction of a new ontological category with all ontological commitments that go together herewith\xE2\x80\x9D (205). Accordingly, the rest of their essay is devoted to an examination of what results if this ontologizing interpretation is taken seriously, both in the <i>Psychology</i> and in Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s later reist works. In the end, they find themselves in agreement with Jacquette\xE2\x80\x99s claim that no consistent metaphysics of intentional objects is to be found in Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s early intentionality thesis.</p>  \n\
  <p>Linda McAlister is more sanguine about the hopes for a consistent doctrine of intentionality in the <i>Psychology</i>. While she entitles her contribution \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano\xE2\x80\x99s epistemology\xE2\x80\x9D, she devotes the bulk of her essay to the defense of a \xE2\x80\x9CScholastic\xE2\x80\x9D reading of the intentionality thesis. According to this reading objects may be said to have two different modes of being or existence, actual existence or existence in the world, and intentional existence or existence in the mind. Like Anselm, for whom God literally exists both \xE2\x80\x9Cin the mind\xE2\x80\x9D and extramentally, McAlister\xE2\x80\x99s Brentano holds that everyday objects like horses enjoy extramental existence and, when perceived, thought about, or otherwise intended, a literal existence \xE2\x80\x9Cin the mind\xE2\x80\x9D. McAlister\xE2\x80\x99s reading has the virtue of taking seriously the Aristotelian and Scholastic roots of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thesis. It must be admitted, however, that her reading introduces metaphysical problems of its own, among them issues surrounding the viability of the proposed temporary \xE2\x80\x9Cdoubling\xE2\x80\x9D of worldly objects when they are taken up as the objects of intending acts and the relations that would be required to hold between these two corresponding sets of objects.</p>  \n\
  <p>Two additional essays help situate Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s early intentionality thesis within his empirical psychology as a whole and examine further attempts to provide a coherent interpretation of this thesis. Kevin Mulligan\xE2\x80\x99s essay, \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano on the mind\xE2\x80\x9D, locates Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s discovery of the intentional character of mental phenomena within the context of his broader descriptive psychological examination of the mental realm. Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thesis is thereby revealed to be merely one among a number of descriptive psychological claims, all purportedly grounded in the immediate evidence of the faculty of inner perception. While this essay succeeds in revealing the range and fruitfulness of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s studies of mental phenomena, it offers only a cursory discussion of the descriptive psychological method itself, leaving it unclear how seriously the close analogy that Mulligan draws between descriptive psychology and contemporary philosophy of mind should be taken. Joseph Margolis\xE2\x80\x99 rather disconnected \xE2\x80\x9CReflections on intentionality\xE2\x80\x9D overlap somewhat with Jacquette\xE2\x80\x99s essay, and with Schuhmann\xE2\x80\x99s closing essay on Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s impact on twentieth-century philosophy. Most helpful in Margolis\xE2\x80\x99 essay is the section that deals with Chisholm\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thesis, an interpretation that Margolis rightly insists is \xE2\x80\x9Cstrangely inapt\xE2\x80\x9D as a reading of Brentano and perhaps best read as a \xE2\x80\x9Cvery reasonable (alternative) account\xE2\x80\x9D (139, 140). Given the widespread acceptance among contemporary analytic philosophers of mind of the Chisholmian reading of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thesis, this point deserves a more extended treatment than Margolis gives it here. Further, Margolis inexplicably resorts to Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s later reist doctrines in criticizing Chisholm\xE2\x80\x99s reading of the early intentionality thesis. This is an odd decision, given the differences between the early and later doctrines and the ample resources in Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Psychology</i> for combating the Chisholmian misreading.</p>  \n\
  <p>I have space here only to make brief mention of four additional topical essays devoted, respectively, to Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s logic, his theory of judgment, and his contributions to value theory and philosophy of religion. Peter Simons\xE2\x80\x99 overview of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Csimple but effective reforms\xE2\x80\x9D of elementary deductive logic emphasizes the continuing pedagogical usefulness of a Brentanian approach, built upon an existential theory of judgments and a set of simple inference rules capable of replacing standard syllogistic logic (64). Parsons\xE2\x80\x99 essay on Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s theories of judgment and truth offers a clear and thorough treatment of these theories against the background of Frege\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of abstract thoughts and Russell\xE2\x80\x99s theory of propositions. Wilhem Baumgartner and Lynn Pasquerella survey Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s reistic theory of moral and aesthetic value, emphasizing his unlikely attempt to locate the origins of beauty and goodness in the intentional analogues of aesthetic and ethical emotions. Finally, Susan Krantz Gabriel\xE2\x80\x99s contribution on \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano on religion and natural theology\xE2\x80\x9D situates his natural theology in the context of traditional cosmological proofs and emphasizes his surprisingly broad and deep knowledge of the sciences of his time, particularly Darwinism and thermodynamics.</p>  \n\
  <p>While the volume\xE2\x80\x99s topical essays provide a solid overview of the range of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thought, those devoted to explorations of the influences on his thought and the significance of his doctrines for later thinkers are less successful. An essay by Rolf George and Glen Koehn on \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano\xE2\x80\x99s relation to Aristotle\xE2\x80\x9D is the sole contribution devoted exclusively to a consideration of the sources of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thinking. George and Koehn aim to tease out the Aristotelian roots of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s intentionality thesis and of his later reism. In opposition to those readers of Brentano who see him primarily as an appropriator of Aristotelian doctrines, they diagnose a \xE2\x80\x9Cstubborn perseverance\xE2\x80\x9D in his attempts, guided by Aquinas, to bring an overall consistency to the Aristotelian corpus (35). While George and Koehn succeed in highlighting some of the Aristotelian and Scholastic roots of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s doctrines, their approach obscures the significance of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s importation of these doctrines into a philosophical context that is distinctly modern in its epistemological, metaphysical, and methodological bearings. In this regard, it would have been be valuable to consider Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s acknowledged debts to the empiricist philosophy of Descartes, Hume, and Locke as well as to the work of such near-contemporaries as Mill and Comte. An essay devoted to exploring these modern and contemporary influences would serve as an antidote to the temptation to succumb to an over-Scholasticized reading of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy, and especially of his empirical psychology. Gestures toward these modern influences may be found in many of the essays in the volume, most notably in Jacquette\xE2\x80\x99s brief discussion in his introductory essay of the burgeoning of a distinctive \xE2\x80\x9CAustrian philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D. There is, however, no sustained consideration of these influences to counterbalance the strongly Aristotelian reading offered by George and Koehn.</p>  \n\
  <p>Rounding out the collection are two essays devoted to Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s influence on subsequent philosophy, a tightly focused discussion by Robin Rollinger of \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano and Husserl\xE2\x80\x9D and a survey piece by Karl Schuhmann on \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano\xE2\x80\x99s impact on twentieth-century philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D. Rollinger\xE2\x80\x99s essay is helpful for its careful examination of the Brentanian roots of Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s early phenomenology. Considerations of space certainly played a role here, but one would have liked to see similar in-depth discussions of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s influence on Heidegger and on analytic philosophy. Schuhmann\xE2\x80\x99s broad-ranging essay is helpful as a starting point for explorations of these and other lesser-known lines of influence. Schuhmann also takes up briefly the problem of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s invisibility, attributing it in part to the latter\xE2\x80\x99s failure to leave behind extensive notes for his lectures (the contrast here with Husserl is striking), and to the fact that many of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s substantive philosophical theses, as well as the distinctive way in which he practiced philosophy, were learned by his followers not through published writings but quite literally at the master\xE2\x80\x99s feet. As Schuhmann rightly emphasizes, in spite of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s invisibility it would be difficult to envision the emergence of the phenomenological approach in the absence of its methodological grounding in Brentanian descriptive psychology. Similarly, it would be difficult to imagine later analytic treatments of intentionality and the metaphysics of real vs. irreal objects in the absence of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s important contributions.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

  <p>Two additional essays help situate Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s early intentionality thesis within his empirical psychology as a whole and examine further attempts to provide a coherent interpretation of this thesis. Kevin Mulligan\xE2\x80\x99s essay, \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano on the mind\xE2\x80\x9D, locates Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s discovery of the intentional character of mental phenomena within the context of his broader descriptive psychological examination of the mental realm.

Most helpful in Margolis\xE2\x80\x99 essay is the section that deals with Chisholm\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thesis, an interpretation that Margolis rightly insists is \xE2\x80\x9Cstrangely inapt\xE2\x80\x9D as a reading of Brentano and perhaps best read as a \xE2\x80\x9Cvery reasonable (alternative) account\xE2\x80\x9D (139, 140). Given the widespread acceptance among contemporary analytic philosophers of mind of the Chisholmian reading of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thesis, this point deserves a more extended treatment than Margolis gives it here. Further, Margolis inexplicably resorts to Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s later reist doctrines in criticizing Chisholm\xE2\x80\x99s reading of the early intentionality thesis. This is an odd decision, given the differences between the early and later doctrines and the ample resources in Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Psychology</i> for combating the Chisholmian misreading.</p>  \n\
  <p>I have space here only to make brief mention of four additional topical essays devoted, respectively, to Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s logic, his theory of judgment, and his contributions to value theory and philosophy of religion. Peter Simons\xE2\x80\x99 overview of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Csimple but effective reforms\xE2\x80\x9D of elementary deductive logic emphasizes the continuing pedagogical usefulness of a Brentanian approach, built upon an existential theory of judgments and a set of simple inference rules capable of replacing standard syllogistic logic (64). Parsons\xE2\x80\x99 essay on Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s theories of judgment and truth offers a clear and thorough treatment of these theories against the background of Frege\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of abstract thoughts and Russell\xE2\x80\x99s theory of propositions. Wilhem Baumgartner and Lynn Pasquerella survey Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s reistic theory of moral and aesthetic value, emphasizing his unlikely attempt to locate the origins of beauty and goodness in the intentional analogues of aesthetic and ethical emotions. Finally, Susan Krantz Gabriel\xE2\x80\x99s contribution on \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano on religion and natural theology\xE2\x80\x9D situates his natural theology in the context of traditional cosmological proofs and emphasizes his surprisingly broad and deep knowledge of the sciences of his time, particularly Darwinism and thermodynamics.</p>  \n\
  <p>While the volume\xE2\x80\x99s topical essays provide a solid overview of the range of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thought, those devoted to explorations of the influences on his thought and the significance of his doctrines for later thinkers are less successful. An essay by Rolf George and Glen Koehn on \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano\xE2\x80\x99s relation to Aristotle\xE2\x80\x9D is the sole contribution devoted exclusively to a consideration of the sources of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s thinking. George and Koehn aim to tease out the Aristotelian roots of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s intentionality thesis and of his later reism. In opposition to those readers of Brentano who see him primarily as an appropriator of Aristotelian doctrines, they diagnose a \xE2\x80\x9Cstubborn perseverance\xE2\x80\x9D in his attempts, guided by Aquinas, to bring an overall consistency to the Aristotelian corpus (35). While George and Koehn succeed in highlighting some of the Aristotelian and Scholastic roots of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s doctrines, their approach obscures the significance of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s importation of these doctrines into a philosophical context that is distinctly modern in its epistemological, metaphysical, and methodological bearings. In this regard, it would have been be valuable to consider Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s acknowledged debts to the empiricist philosophy of Descartes, Hume, and Locke as well as to the work of such near-contemporaries as Mill and Comte. An essay devoted to exploring these modern and contemporary influences would serve as an antidote to the temptation to succumb to an over-Scholasticized reading of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy, and especially of his empirical psychology. Gestures toward these modern influences may be found in many of the essays in the volume, most notably in Jacquette\xE2\x80\x99s brief discussion in his introductory essay of the burgeoning of a distinctive \xE2\x80\x9CAustrian philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D. There is, however, no sustained consideration of these influences to counterbalance the strongly Aristotelian reading offered by George and Koehn.</p>  \n\
  <p>Rounding out the collection are two essays devoted to Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s influence on subsequent philosophy, a tightly focused discussion by Robin Rollinger of \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano and Husserl\xE2\x80\x9D and a survey piece by Karl Schuhmann on \xE2\x80\x9CBrentano\xE2\x80\x99s impact on twentieth-century philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D. Rollinger\xE2\x80\x99s essay is helpful for its careful examination of the Brentanian roots of Husserl\xE2\x80\x99s early phenomenology. Considerations of space certainly played a role here, but one would have liked to see similar in-depth discussions of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s influence on Heidegger and on analytic philosophy. Schuhmann\xE2\x80\x99s broad-ranging essay is helpful as a starting point for explorations of these and other lesser-known lines of influence. Schuhmann also takes up briefly the problem of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s invisibility, attributing it in part to the latter\xE2\x80\x99s failure to leave behind extensive notes for his lectures (the contrast here with Husserl is striking), and to the fact that many of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s substantive philosophical theses, as well as the distinctive way in which he practiced philosophy, were learned by his followers not through published writings but quite literally at the master\xE2\x80\x99s feet. As Schuhmann rightly emphasizes, in spite of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s invisibility it would be difficult to envision the emergence of the phenomenological approach in the absence of its methodological grounding in Brentanian descriptive psychology. Similarly, it would be difficult to imagine later analytic treatments of intentionality and the metaphysics of real vs. irreal objects in the absence of Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s important contributions.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
