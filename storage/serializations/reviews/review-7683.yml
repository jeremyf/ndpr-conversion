content: "<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Marl\xC3\xA8ne Zarader's important work of Heidegger-criticism, <i>The Unthought Debt</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, is not exactly new; it was originally published in French in 1990 under the title, </span><i>La dette impens\xC3\xA9e: Heidegger et l'h\xC3\xA9ritage h\xC3\xA9bra\xC3\xAFque</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and those of us who had the good fortune to read the book in its original form have been citing it and recommending it with much enthusiasm to our colleagues.<span style=\"\">  </span>We can now be grateful to Bettina Bergo for the precision and elegance of her translation, which will, one hopes, now make the book available to a far wider readership.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The questions that guide Zarader's investigation are at once intriguing and highly controversial: Why does Heidegger appear so reluctant to grant the tradition of \"Hebraic\" thought its rightful place alongside the Greek tradition in the philosophical history of the West?<span style=\"\">  </span>What is the logic by which the Hebraic tradition is occluded from Heidegger's conception of that history?<span style=\"\">  </span>And does not this occlusion seem doubly perplexing when one considers the -- in Zarader's view -- strong affinity between Heidegger's own patterns of philosophical reflection and those of the specifically Hebraic tradition?<span style=\"\">  </span>What, more precisely, does that affinity consist in?<span style=\"\">  </span>The core message of Zarader's book is not only that Heidegger fails to acknowledge this second and non-Greek resource for philosophy; it is that Heidegger actively reduces this heritage to \"speechlessness\" even while -- and here is the central irony -- the Hebraic understanding of key philosophical categories would appear closely to resemble the key categories of Heidegger's own philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span>Heidegger's unspoken and unrecognized -- even suppressed -- philosophical-historical investment in the Hebraic heritage thus comprises what Zarader calls an \"unthought debt.\"<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">To be sure, the basic message of the book as summarized above is not without scholarly precedent:<span style=\"\">  </span>A number of other readers (including Stanley Rosen, Paul Ricoeur, and Jacques Derrida) have commented upon the \"Hebraic\" features of Heidegger's philosophy, while others have noted Heidegger's strange avoidance of the Hebraic tradition.<span style=\"\">  </span>Ricoeur, for example, in remarks Zarader quotes in her introduction, notes that:<span style=\"\">  </span>\"What has often astonished me about Heidegger is that he would have systematically eluded . . . the confrontation with the block of Hebraic thought.<span style=\"\">  </span>He sometimes reflected on the basis of the Gospels and of Christian theology, but always avoided the Hebraic cluster, which is the absolute stranger to the Greek discourse . . .\" (Quoted in Zarader, 7). Yet according to others scholars, the deeper question is why Heidegger would seem to avoid this body of thought that nonetheless animates his own work:<span style=\"\">  </span>Rosen writes of Heidegger's debt to the \"Hebraic\" almost as if it did not require further explanation.<span style=\"\">  </span>A great many others (including John MacQuarrie, Leo Strauss, Richard Kr\xC3\xB6ner, and Franz Rosenzweig) have discerned the theological strain in Heidegger's thinking without seeking to identify it with any one religious tradition:<span style=\"\">  </span>Rosenzweig spoke of the \"earthly path of revelation\" as a legacy shared in common by Christians, pagans, and Jews.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">What distinguishes Zarader's inquiry from those of other scholars is not only its focus and length -- previous writers have only remarked on this troubled affinity, they have not made it the central object of study -- it also makes an unprecedented and earnest attempt to expose in a quasi-systematic fashion the most important facets of this \"debt\" by comparing Heidegger's philosophy with the global commitments of what Zarader calls the \"Hebraic Heritage.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>This alone makes Zarader's book especially deserving of attention, especially so for those of us who remain unconvinced by the charge (made famous by Levinas) that Heidegger's philosophy is the pure and uncontaminated expression of the Greek tradition alone.<span style=\"\">  </span>For Zarader, the Levinasian interpretation is \"deformed\" (yet she is clearly conflicted about stating this too bluntly, and she warns us off from this word with quotation marks):<span style=\"\">  </span>Levinas \"forgets\" (quotation marks again) \"all that which in Being, in Heidegger's sense, might be liable to approximate it to the Other, and, more broadly, all that which, in Heidegger's work, could evoke the biblical universe.\" (145)<span style=\"\">  </span>Levinas is therefore tempted \"even to exaggerate\" the distance between Heidegger and the Hebraic, even while the exaggeration is deployed \"not in order to caricature Heidegger's thought, but on the contrary to expose that which is most proper to it\" (which is to say, <i>the ethical</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">). (146)<span style=\"\">   </span>Zarader refuses to follow Levinas in this exaggeration; instead, she seeks to expose the proximity that even Heidegger himself wished to deny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><i>The Unthought Debt </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">is organized into two parts.<span style=\"\">  </span>The first half begins with an excursus on the \"rule of interpretation\" that governs Heidegger's conception of the history of philosophy:<span style=\"\">  </span>the general rule is that of a basic \"split\" between the originary and the derivative, where the latter is the path of metaphysical error stretching all the way back to the inception of Western philosophy in Greece.<span style=\"\">  </span>As Zarader reminds us, Heidegger pushes this errancy \"ever farther </span><i>back</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\" to Aristotle, Plato, and eventually to Parmenides, until eventually he concludes that metaphysics begins at the very start of Greek philosophy such that \"Heidegger finishes by stepping in some sense outside of the </span><i>Greek </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">itself.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>At this point the question arises as to how Heidegger can imagine an </span><i>other</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to metaphysical history:<span style=\"\">  </span>an </span><i>originary</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> tradition of (non-metaphysical) thinking.<span style=\"\">  </span>As Zarader explains, the problem is that Heidegger seems to acknowledge </span><i>only one origin</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">:<span style=\"\">  </span>if philosophical history remains essentially Greek, then </span><i>any</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> tradition beyond the Greek remains essentially </span><i>unthought</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.<span style=\"\">  </span>This rule of interpretation governs virtually all of Heidegger's writing.<span style=\"\">  </span>And it renders Heidegger's non-acknowledgement of his debt to the Hebraic heritage all the more perplexing.<span style=\"\">  </span>Zarader follows this excursus with three comparative essays that seek to show how Heidegger imagines three categories of philosophy -- language, thought, and interpretation -- in a fashion strongly reminiscent of the Hebrew Bible.<span style=\"\">  </span>About language, Zarader argues that Heidegger shares with the \"biblical universe\" the view that language is a mode of revelation.<span style=\"\">  </span>For \"[t]he central idea around which the entire Jewish experience of language is organized is that language does not have the status of an instrument.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Instead, it is \"the crucible of all that is: it is in language that all beings are first held; language is that from which beings can break forth into presence\" (and so forth). (43)<span style=\"\">  </span>Such a conception, Zarader suggests, bears a remarkable similarity to the Heideggerian understanding, in which language makes possible \"the founding of Being.\" (41)<span style=\"\">  </span>Moreover,<span style=\"\">  </span>Heidegger's conception of the poet closely resembles the biblical image of the prophet, as, e.g., a messenger.<span style=\"\">  </span>Similar affinities are discovered between the Heideggerian and (Hebraic) biblical categories of \"thought\" and of \"interpretation.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>The chapters are exceedingly rich and forbid easy summary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">In the second half of the book, Zarader addresses more directly the three \"problems\" that might seem to obstruct her analysis:<span style=\"\">  </span>1) Does Heidegger's concern with Being allow for any comparison with the Hebraic conception of God?<span style=\"\">  </span>The answer here seems to be that certain key features of Being bear a close resemblance to Kabbalistic imagery, especially the figurative account of the divine essence as a hidden plenitude whose withdrawal is the condition for the world's appearance.<span style=\"\">  </span>2) If this is more than mere resemblance and we imagine Heidegger actually drew upon biblical concepts, what was the vehicle of this transmission?<span style=\"\">  </span>Zarader's answer here is hardly surprising:<span style=\"\">  </span>Heidegger absorbs Hebraic patterns of thought via Christianity, but then \"forgets\" the specifically \"Old Testament\" character of the concepts in question. Here Zarader takes care to note that the fault for this oblivion does not lie with Heidegger alone:<span style=\"\">  </span>it belongs to a fundamental pattern in Christian self-understanding to regard the Jewish background as superseded and no longer of independent interest.<span style=\"\">  </span>3) In the final chapter Zarader lays down a series of discerning and quite subtle objections to Derrida's understanding of Heidegger as presented in <i>De l'esprit</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.<span style=\"\">  </span>Unlike Derrida (whose acumen she acknowledges), Zarader believes that Heidegger's error is not to have acknowledged the true sources of his own more \"originary\" reflections.<span style=\"\">  </span>Hence the closing irony (in Zarader's words), that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">the thinker who, more amply than any other, <i>restored</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to Western thought the determinations central to the Hebraic universe is precisely he who never said anything about the Hebraic as such, who, more massively than any other, effaced it from thought and, more broadly, from the West itself. (185)<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">But what is \"the Hebraic\"?<span style=\"\">  </span>At this point let me forgo any further summary and instead address what I take to be the book's most questionable assumption:<span style=\"\">  </span>the <i>unity </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">or </span><i>coherence </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">it wants to ascribe to something so vast and evidently complicated as the \"Hebraic heritage.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Here I confess that my admiration for Zarader's questions gives way to skepticism regarding some of her bolder suggestions.<span style=\"\">  </span>Let me articulate this skepticism with a simple question:<span style=\"\">  </span>What is </span><i>the</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> \"Hebraic\" heritage?<span style=\"\">  </span>The emphasis -- \"the\" -- is the signal for all of my doubts; yet it is important to note that this determinate article is absolutely indispensable to Zarader's project.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Zarader describes the Hebraic heritage as \"a gigantic and proliferating cluster.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>In it <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">we find inextricably interwoven a language (Hebrew) a text (Bible) a tradition of thinking and writing (Talmudic, midrashic, kabbalistic, etc., literatures), a religion (Judaism) and finally a people with its history and its myths. (9)<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">But do these form a single fabric with one distinctive pattern?<span style=\"\">  </span>And what makes its pattern distinct from others? Zarader is ready to admit that there are \"exchanges\" between traditions.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is prudent; for who could deny the philosophical cross-pollination between the \"Hebraic-biblical\" and the \"Hellenistic\"?<span style=\"\">  </span>But her analysis strives to contain -- and logically it <i>requires</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that she contain -- such exchanges, since she is intent upon claiming that there is something </span><i>specific and identifiably Hebraic </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">in Heidegger's work whose identification he has suppressed.<span style=\"\">  </span>Zarader is therefore forced to describe the contents of the Hebraic tradition, and even in describing them she betrays a conviction that they remain analytically distinct:<span style=\"\">  </span>hence what she calls \"external influences\" (as if the \"internal\" admitted of separate definition).<span style=\"\">  </span>Stranger still is the presupposition that the Hebraic heritage is \"preserved and transmitted -- not in a pure way, to be sure, but perhaps purer than elsewhere -- in Jewish memory.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>And therefore \"this heritage (like every heritage) is an indissociable fabric made of </span><i>language </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">and thought\" such that we can deduce \"the specific relationship that a people maintains with its universe.\" (11)<span style=\"\">  </span>In sum, the Hebraic heritage is nothing less than a \"signifying totality.\" (11)<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Here lies a danger and a host of questions.<span style=\"\">  </span>By what logic can a tradition be defined as a totality of significance?<span style=\"\">  </span>Is a \"tradition\" even a philosophical concept?<span style=\"\">  </span>Is it something with borders, boundaries, an enclosed region of space?<span style=\"\">  </span>Can a body of thought exhibit this sort of geometry?<span style=\"\">  </span>Can it truly be separate from what we might fear to call its \"exterior\"? And can we describe it as nourishing itself through time by means of communal memory -- \"not in a pure way\" but \"perhaps purer than elsewhere\"?<span style=\"\">  </span>Supporting Zarader's admirable efforts throughout her otherwise thoughtful and scrupulously philosophical book is the strangely unphilosophical assumption that there is indeed a self-identical and transhistorical object under discussion that we can characterize simply as -- \"the Hebraic.\" Yet her efforts to characterize that object are disabled by a number of curious (if perhaps unavoidable) restrictions.<span style=\"\">  </span>Most of the authorities called upon to define the Hebraic heritage belong to the twentieth century, which may prompt the worry that we are not dealing with a \"heritage\" itself but with a certain eminently modernist construction of it. And many of those authorities are already philosophers and philologians whose conceptions of the \"heritage\" are anything but \"pure\" since they are developed almost inevitably within the discourse of the modern West, a discourse which itself is both Hellenistic and Hebraic at once. More worrisome is the authoritative position Zarader seems ready to award Gershom Scholem as the spokesperson for \"the Hebraic\" as such, although Scholem's interpretations are famously controversial.<span style=\"\">  </span>(Incidentally, the youthful Scholem was swept up within the same post-Nietzschean philosophical currents that moved Heidegger, which renders the use of Scholem's contemporary writings on Judaism as independent support for a resemblance between Heidegger and the Hebraic somewhat circular).<span style=\"\">  </span>More dubious still is the fact that Zarader's evidentiary texts are confined chiefly to the Kabbalah, to such a degree that the Kabbalistic tradition becomes almost identical in meaning to the \"the Hebraic.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Granted, \"the Kabbalistic tradition\" is a pleonasm: since \"Kabbalah\" in Hebrew means \"the tradition\" or \"what is received.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>But this cannot license an identification between them, and we should remember that since rabbinic times many exponents of normative Judaism have regarded the Kabbalah with some ambivalence and have even charged it with heresy.<span style=\"\">  </span>(In fact, recent post-Scholemian scholarship has suggested that certain key motifs in Kabbalistic thought may derive from Christianity, and it should be remembered that throughout the medieval period Kabbalah was -- like alchemy -- at once an esoteric and popular practice transcending exclusive religious identities).<span style=\"\">  </span>Zarader resorts rather too frequently to Kabbalistic examples, yet only <i>once</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> does she note that the Kabbalah worked its way into the German philosophical tradition via Schelling (\"whom Heidegger read so assiduously\"). (168).<span style=\"\">  </span>So the question remains whether Heidegger's bond is really to \"the Hebraic\" as such or only to certain motifs and strains of thinking that were, from their beginning, perhaps, passing back and forth among several traditions while belonging essentially or exclusively to none.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">And why, after all, do we require this strange circumlocution, \"the Hebraic?\"<span style=\"\">  </span>What is almost never used in the book would be the near-synonym:<span style=\"\">  </span>\"the Jewish,\" maybe for reasons of disciplinary propriety, since the latter might have carried all of the unwanted associations of social or national-identity, the complications of history and politics.<span style=\"\">  </span>What is also never admitted outright is the rhetorical-political <i>effect </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">of claiming that Heidegger is suppressing his bond to Hebraic thinking and that he has conspired even \"to </span><i>reduce</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that heritage </span><i>to speechlessness</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.\" What is the pathos of this claim? Clearly -- how can this be forgotten? -- it is a pathos due to Heidegger's history, and what we now can call justifiably his anti-Semitism. Since these associations can hardly be avoided and could even be said to operate as the moral horizon for the book, one might have expected Zarader to offer some comment upon their significance.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is surprising, then, that notwithstanding their subterranean influence she leaves them altogether unspoken, perhaps because -- even in a book that indicts Heidegger with \"suppression\" or \"forgetting\" -- they would disrupt the illusion of a purely intellectual inquiry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   The final irony is that Heidegger himself relies everywhere in his own work upon just these holistic-romantic notions of \"heritage\" and \"tradition.\" For Heidegger, the chief object of both retrieval and destruction was \"Greek philosophy\", a contrivance, albeit a necessary one, which already conspired to suppress all of the differences and alterities that might otherwise have complicated Heidegger's grand narrative of ontological oblivion.<span style=\"\">  </span>As early as <i>Being and Time</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> he invoked the notion of a \"proper\" (or \"authentic\") heritage, one which each people was to take over from its past and renew. But what demands that \"a people\" (notice the singular noun) obey such patterns of national-holistic continuity?<span style=\"\">  </span>For Heidegger it seemed somehow a logical premise: it first appears in his brilliant analysis of the artisan's workshop: that local world in which all is known through the intimacy of use and each tool seemed to fit without difficulty into a \"holistic network of significance.\" Yet this very premise lies at the roots of an unthinking historical-philosophical romanticism according to which the world is organized into separable and coherent intellectual traditions, each of them with their own \"memory\" or \"people\" to carry them forward.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is therefore a matter of some frustration that Zarader, in her otherwise thought provoking and insightful analysis of Heidegger, seems ultimately to recapitulate his most questionable logic, since even as she faults Heidegger for failing to recognize his debt to another philosophical \"heritage\" she affords that very concept an unquestioned legitimacy.</span>"

(185)<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">But what is \"the Hebraic\"?<span style=\"\">  </span>At this point let me forgo any further summary and instead address what I take to be the book's most questionable assumption:<span style=\"\">  </span>the <i>unity </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">or </span><i>coherence </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">it wants to ascribe to something so vast and evidently complicated as the \"Hebraic heritage.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Here I confess that my admiration for Zarader's questions gives way to skepticism regarding some of her bolder suggestions.<span style=\"\">  </span>Let me articulate this skepticism with a simple question:<span style=\"\">  </span>What is </span><i>the</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> \"Hebraic\" heritage?<span style=\"\">  </span>The emphasis -- \"the\" -- is the signal for all of my doubts; yet it is important to note that this determinate article is absolutely indispensable to Zarader's project.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Zarader describes the Hebraic heritage as \"a gigantic and proliferating cluster.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>In it <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">we find inextricably interwoven a language (Hebrew) a text (Bible) a tradition of thinking and writing (Talmudic, midrashic, kabbalistic, etc., literatures), a religion (Judaism) and finally a people with its history and its myths. (9)<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">But do these form a single fabric with one distinctive pattern?<span style=\"\">  </span>And what makes its pattern distinct from others? Zarader is ready to admit that there are \"exchanges\" between traditions.<span style=\"\">  </span>This is prudent; for who could deny the philosophical cross-pollination between the \"Hebraic-biblical\" and the \"Hellenistic\"?<span style=\"\">  </span>But her analysis strives to contain -- and logically it <i>requires</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that she contain -- such exchanges, since she is intent upon claiming that there is something </span><i>specific and identifiably Hebraic </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">in Heidegger's work whose identification he has suppressed.<span style=\"\">  </span>Zarader is therefore forced to describe the contents of the Hebraic tradition, and even in describing them she betrays a conviction that they remain analytically distinct:<span style=\"\">  </span>hence what she calls \"external influences\" (as if the \"internal\" admitted of separate definition).<span style=\"\">  </span>Stranger still is the presupposition that the Hebraic heritage is \"preserved and transmitted -- not in a pure way, to be sure, but perhaps purer than elsewhere -- in Jewish memory.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>And therefore \"this heritage (like every heritage) is an indissociable fabric made of </span><i>language </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">and thought\" such that we can deduce \"the specific relationship that a people maintains with its universe.\" (11)<span style=\"\">  </span>In sum, the Hebraic heritage is nothing less than a \"signifying totality.\" (11)<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Here lies a danger and a host of questions.<span style=\"\">  </span>By what logic can a tradition be defined as a totality of significance?<span style=\"\">  </span>Is a \"tradition\" even a philosophical concept?<span style=\"\">  </span>Is it something with borders, boundaries, an enclosed region of space?<span style=\"\">  </span>Can a body of thought exhibit this sort of geometry?<span style=\"\">  </span>Can it truly be separate from what we might fear to call its \"exterior\"? And can we describe it as nourishing itself through time by means of communal memory -- \"not in a pure way\" but \"perhaps purer than elsewhere\"?<span style=\"\">  </span>Supporting Zarader's admirable efforts throughout her otherwise thoughtful and scrupulously philosophical book is the strangely unphilosophical assumption that there is indeed a self-identical and transhistorical object under discussion that we can characterize simply as -- \"the Hebraic.\" Yet her efforts to characterize that object are disabled by a number of curious (if perhaps unavoidable) restrictions.<span style=\"\">  </span>Most of the authorities called upon to define the Hebraic heritage belong to the twentieth century, which may prompt the worry that we are not dealing with a \"heritage\" itself but with a certain eminently modernist construction of it. And many of those authorities are already philosophers and philologians whose conceptions of the \"heritage\" are anything but \"pure\" since they are developed almost inevitably within the discourse of the modern West, a discourse which itself is both Hellenistic and Hebraic at once. More worrisome is the authoritative position Zarader seems ready to award Gershom Scholem as the spokesperson for \"the Hebraic\" as such, although Scholem's interpretations are famously controversial.<span style=\"\">  </span>(Incidentally, the youthful Scholem was swept up within the same post-Nietzschean philosophical currents that moved Heidegger, which renders the use of Scholem's contemporary writings on Judaism as independent support for a resemblance between Heidegger and the Hebraic somewhat circular).<span style=\"\">  </span>More dubious still is the fact that Zarader's evidentiary texts are confined chiefly to the Kabbalah, to such a degree that the Kabbalistic tradition becomes almost identical in meaning to the \"the Hebraic.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>Granted, \"the Kabbalistic tradition\" is a pleonasm: since \"Kabbalah\" in Hebrew means \"the tradition\" or \"what is received.\"<span style=\"\">  </span>But this cannot license an identification between them, and we should remember that since rabbinic times many exponents of normative Judaism have regarded the Kabbalah with some ambivalence and have even charged it with heresy.<span style=\"\">  </span>(In fact, recent post-Scholemian scholarship has suggested that certain key motifs in Kabbalistic thought may derive from Christianity, and it should be remembered that throughout the medieval period Kabbalah was -- like alchemy -- at once an esoteric and popular practice transcending exclusive religious identities).<span style=\"\">  </span>Zarader resorts rather too frequently to Kabbalistic examples, yet only <i>once</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> does she note that the Kabbalah worked its way into the German philosophical tradition via Schelling (\"whom Heidegger read so assiduously\"). (168).<span style=\"\">  </span>So the question remains whether Heidegger's bond is really to \"the Hebraic\" as such or only to certain motifs and strains of thinking that were, from their beginning, perhaps, passing back and forth among several traditions while belonging essentially or exclusively to none.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">And why, after all, do we require this strange circumlocution, \"the Hebraic?\"<span style=\"\">  </span>What is almost never used in the book would be the near-synonym:<span style=\"\">  </span>\"the Jewish,\" maybe for reasons of disciplinary propriety, since the latter might have carried all of the unwanted associations of social or national-identity, the complications of history and politics.<span style=\"\">  </span>What is also never admitted outright is the rhetorical-political <i>effect </i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">of claiming that Heidegger is suppressing his bond to Hebraic thinking and that he has conspired even \"to </span><i>reduce</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that heritage </span><i>to speechlessness</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.\" What is the pathos of this claim? Clearly -- how can this be forgotten? -- it is a pathos due to Heidegger's history, and what we now can call justifiably his anti-Semitism. Since these associations can hardly be avoided and could even be said to operate as the moral horizon for the book, one might have expected Zarader to offer some comment upon their significance.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is surprising, then, that notwithstanding their subterranean influence she leaves them altogether unspoken, perhaps because -- even in a book that indicts Heidegger with \"suppression\" or \"forgetting\" -- they would disrupt the illusion of a purely intellectual inquiry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   The final irony is that Heidegger himself relies everywhere in his own work upon just these holistic-romantic notions of \"heritage\" and \"tradition.\" For Heidegger, the chief object of both retrieval and destruction was \"Greek philosophy\", a contrivance, albeit a necessary one, which already conspired to suppress all of the differences and alterities that might otherwise have complicated Heidegger's grand narrative of ontological oblivion.<span style=\"\">  </span>As early as <i>Being and Time</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> he invoked the notion of a \"proper\" (or \"authentic\") heritage, one which each people was to take over from its past and renew. But what demands that \"a people\" (notice the singular noun) obey such patterns of national-holistic continuity?<span style=\"\">  </span>For Heidegger it seemed somehow a logical premise: it first appears in his brilliant analysis of the artisan's workshop: that local world in which all is known through the intimacy of use and each tool seemed to fit without difficulty into a \"holistic network of significance.\" Yet this very premise lies at the roots of an unthinking historical-philosophical romanticism according to which the world is organized into separable and coherent intellectual traditions, each of them with their own \"memory\" or \"people\" to carry them forward.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is therefore a matter of some frustration that Zarader, in her otherwise thought provoking and insightful analysis of Heidegger, seems ultimately to recapitulate his most questionable logic, since even as she faults Heidegger for failing to recognize his debt to another philosophical \"heritage\" she affords that very concept an unquestioned legitimacy.</span>"
