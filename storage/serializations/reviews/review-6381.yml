A.

M. Sainsbury shows us how Hume's treatment of causation remains a challenge to contemporary metaphysics and philosophy of mind.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">A third set of essays looks at the impressions that Hume made on his contemporaries.<span style=\"\">  </span>Emilio Mazza investigates the responses of two contributors to the Enlightenment in Italy -- the brothers Pietro and Allesandro Verri -- especially their reactions to Hume's and Rousseau's falling out.<span style=\"\">  </span>Sarah Pearsall focuses on the letters of an Anglo-American couple, reading their negotiation of marital discord through the lens of Hume's and other early-modern discussions of marriage and sexuality.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Finally, co-editor Marina Frasca-Spada looks at Hume's own account of impressions.<span style=\"\">  </span>She uses a popular eighteenth-century novel to motivate her discussion of the difference between the impression-like beliefs that Hume thinks we derive from reading history with the less vivacious -- though often more attention-demanding -- ideas that result from reading fiction.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">It should be clear, then, that this a wide-ranging collection.<span style=\"\">  </span>What it lacks in thematic unity is made up for by its admirable breadth in method and style. <span style=\"\"> </span>Continental and analytic philosophy, literary criticism, intellectual history, philosophically-oriented history of philosophy, and biography all make an appearance here.<span style=\"\">  </span>The editors are to be commended for bringing together Hume scholarship from across the disciplines.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">I will focus on one essay for more detailed, though still brief, comment -- namely Peter Kail's intriguing suggestion that the Conclusion to Book 1 of the <i>Treatise</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is best read as Hume's rejection of Malebranche's ethical ideal, where we are to strive to overcome our corrupt natures by withdrawing from the senses and striving to follow the divine in us, reason.<span style=\"\">  </span>Rationalist, inward-looking philosophy is the means to achieving this ideal and thus, for Malebranche, all of us should pursue it. <span style=\"\"> </span>Kail sees Hume as recommending an alternative outward-looking, \"public and human\" (137) view of philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is to be pursued for the pleasure it gives and its usefulness in combating superstition, not because it makes us closer to God (136).<span style=\"\">  </span>While Kail is clearly right about the anti-Malebranchian tenor of Hume's overall philosophical project, I am less convinced that this is a dominant theme of the Conclusion.</span></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">The Conclusion is maddeningly complex, as Hume reviews for us his earlier arguments about reason and the senses only to call both them and his doubts about them into question.<span style=\"\">  </span>The climax is what amounts to a nervous breakdown as Hume cries out with anguish: \"Where am I, or what?\"<span style=\"\">  </span>His only escapes are backgammon, conversation, and dinner with friends, though he does eventually return to philosophy with a newly chastened attitude (T 1.4.7.8-9, SBN 269).</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">This section of text has been at the centre of recent debates in the secondary literature and, if Kail is right, he will have added a fourth item to the menu of interpretations currently available for it. The other options are, first, the traditional sceptical interpretation, in which Hume decides to ignore reason's negative verdicts on the deliverances of the senses and of reason.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">2</span></span></a></sup><span style=\"\">  </span>Second, the naturalist interpretation that originated with Norman Kemp Smith in which our natural incapacity to believe those verdicts is given a normative weight that trumps them.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">3</span></span></a></sup> And third, the dialectical interpretation of Annette Baier, in which Hume's narrator's experience of the failings of a narrow intellectualist conception of the mind drives him to adopt a more adequate passion-involving account of reason and the senses.<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">4</span></span></a></sup></p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">But Kail's argument for a new ethical interpretation remains somewhat underdeveloped, making it difficult to determine the extent to which it differs from the other interpretive options.<span style=\"\">  </span>Part of the problem is that he focuses primarily on the later parts of the Conclusion, where Hume returns to philosophy, rather than on the \"desponding reflections\" (T 1.4.7.1, SBN 264) that drive him to his breakdown.<span style=\"\">  </span>Once we have returned to philosophy, are we to accept the \"trivial\" propensities of the imagination that cause us to believe what our memories tell us of the past, what our senses tell us of the external world, or what our reason tells us to believe (T 1.4.7.3, SBN 265)?<span style=\"\">  </span>Kail sometimes sounds like Baier, as if the philosophical problematic that caused us to ask these questions has been abandoned with the adoption of the new pleasure-motivated philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span>But why think that some of us will not continue to take pleasure in exactly this kind of abstruse philosophy?<span style=\"\">  </span>And what are we to make of Hume's repeated invocations of his arguments about reason and the senses when he moves on from the Conclusion to investigate the passions and morality (e.g., T 2.2.6.2, SBN 366)?</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Kail also on occasion sounds like the sceptical interpreters: \"One may see the conclusion as a Pyrrhonian moment of despair, a realization of the failure of reason\" (127).<span style=\"\">  </span>Why then should we trust what we now know to be a failed reason when returning to philosophy for the fun of it?<span style=\"\">  </span>Or does Kail mean to offer a modified version of the naturalist strategy whereby reason's failure is trumped, not by our natural beliefs, but by whatever cognitive practices are agreeable or useful to their possessors or those around them -- by Humean cognitive virtues (128, 134-7)?<span style=\"\">  </span>But what virtues would those be?<span style=\"\">  </span>Wisdom involves properly assessing the evidence for your beliefs,<sup><a style=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span style=\"\">5</span></span></a></sup> and so if reason speaks against a belief, it should be rejected.<span style=\"\">  </span>Prudence requires getting the facts right, for false information will undermine your practical endeavours (T 2.3.3).<span style=\"\">  </span>If Kail takes Hume to endorse the negative claims in the first portion of the Conclusion, I do not see how the virtues will help us to overcome them.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\">My own interpretation of the Conclusion nonetheless shares much with Kail's.<span style=\"\">  </span>Like him, I think that one of its ultimate goals is to downgrade the place of philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span>It is to be undertaken for the pleasure it gives and for it usefulness in combating superstition.<span style=\"\">  </span>But it is not for everyone.</p>   <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">[T]here are in <i>England</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, in particular, many honest gentlemen, who being always employ'd in their domestic affairs, or amusing themselves in common recreations, have carried their thoughts very little beyond those objects, which are every day expos'd to their senses.
