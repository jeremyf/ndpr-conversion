content: "<p>According to Aviezer Tucker, modern historiography is \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific,\xE2\x80\x9D and Bayesian probability theory explains why. He offers a complex, powerful and welcome addition to the philosophical consideration of historical practice. Three points stand out: first, his careful elucidation of what it means to invoke the consensus of a disciplinary community as a warrant for knowledge (ch. 1); second, his historical account of the emergence and consolidation of a paradigm for historical practice, identified with Ranke, which links this decisively not only with its <i>predecessor</i> disciplines but also with its most significant <i>successor</i>, evolutionary biology (ch. 2); and, finally, the Bayesian explication of the \xE2\x80\x9Cnormal science\xE2\x80\x9D component in historical practice, what Tucker calls \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific historiography\xE2\x80\x9D (ch. 3). Less compelling, in my view, are his account of historical disagreement (ch. 4) and his discussion of the limits of historical knowledge (chs. 5-6).</p>  \n\
  <p>A science, for Tucker, is progressive, i.e., it develops new evidence and new knowledge. This is the case, in his view, for modern historiography. \xE2\x80\x9CThrough the historical development of historiography the web of historiographic beliefs has expanded and the connections among its units grew complex. By now, new historiography should fit old historiography as well as new evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (120). Tucker conceives \xE2\x80\x9Cscience\xE2\x80\x9D in only a <i>somewhat</i> post-positivist sense because he still cannot abandon the fact-value dichotomy and he still cannot escape privileging universality as the ultimate talisman of theory. Thus he contrasts the physical sciences favorably with the historical sciences (including evolutionary biology). Post-positivism must, in my view, resolutely dispense with such positivist hangovers. Specifically, I cannot find plausible Tucker\xE2\x80\x99s sharp discrimination of \xE2\x80\x9Chistoriographic knowledge\xE2\x80\x9D from \xE2\x80\x9Chistoriographic interpretation\xE2\x80\x9D (2; 10-12; 142). For Tucker, interpretation falls under value theory, but \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific historiography\xE2\x80\x9D is entirely cognitive. \xE2\x80\x9CToo many philosophies of historiography confuse questions of knowledge with questions of value,\xE2\x80\x9D he writes (12). To <i>reduce</i> the former to the latter is surely inadequate, but to hold them totally distinct is an inverse error, the \xE2\x80\x9Cfinal dogma\xE2\x80\x9D of positivism.</p>  \n\
  <p>Tucker argues that a disciplinary community may make plausible claims to collective knowledge if three constraints are satisfied: the consensus must be <i>uncoerced</i>, it must involve a <i>large number</i> of participants, and a significantly <i>heterogeneous</i> group must reach a <i>unique</i> common judgment. While the claim to knowledge is contingent and fallible, it nevertheless is the best explanation of the consensus. Once this consensus is achieved, a disciplinary community achieves \xE2\x80\x9Cnormal science\xE2\x80\x9D or a paradigm, in Kuhn\xE2\x80\x99s terms. For Tucker, historiography attained this in the early nineteenth century in Germany under the auspices of Ranke. Historiography did not achieve its paradigm autochthonously, however; instead, it adopted a successful paradigm from predecessor inquiries \xE2\x80\x93 biblical criticism, classical philology, and comparative linguistics. Tucker makes the important point that evolutionary biology followed historiography in adopting the essential features of this paradigm and deploying them to constitute its own \xE2\x80\x9Cnormal science.\xE2\x80\x9D This account strikes me not only as sound but also as dramatically important both for defending the ongoing cogency of disciplinary historical practice and for integrating critically and constructively the epistemologies of historicism and naturalism, which I consider a foremost task for philosophy today.</p>  \n\
  <p>For Tucker, the essential task of the philosophy of historiography (as distinct from speciously metaphysical \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy of history\xE2\x80\x9D) is to establish \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether historiography is determined, indeterminate, or underdetermined\xE2\x80\x9D (9; see 45; 256ff). His argument is: \xE2\x80\x9CHistoriographic core theories constrain the possible range of interpretations, but parts of historiography are still underdetermined\xE2\x80\x9D (21) -- largely for lack of sufficient evidence (146-7). Hence the discipline entails elements both of determinacy and of underdetermination. Indeterminacy, on the other hand, is simply not a reasonable characterization (258). Tucker has little patience with \xE2\x80\x9Chistoriographic skepticism,\xE2\x80\x9D as he characterizes postmodernism\xE2\x80\x99s aesthetic or linguistic reformulations of the epistemology of historical practice. Against the tradition from Hayden White and Roland Barthes through Frank Ankersmit, Tucker insists: \xE2\x80\x9CThe form or style of historiography do not affect its relation with the evidence, its epistemic status\xE2\x80\x9D (92). For Tucker, the proper object of study is the <i>practice</i> of historical inquiry, not its ultimate <i>product</i>, hence historical \xE2\x80\x9Ctextbooks\xE2\x80\x9D are irrelevant. His stress on evidence is certainly important, and sophisticated \xE2\x80\x9Ctextualist\xE2\x80\x9D theorists like Ankersmit have no interest in dismissing it. But the converse dismissal is unwise. The <i>construction</i> of working historical texts (monographs, articles, review essays) is <i>not</i> irrelevant to the epistemology of history. In minimizing this aspect of practice, Tucker underestimates the arguments not only of philosophers like Raymond Martin, but of astute historiographic theorists like Evans or Elton or Jordanova, who try to explain from the inside what historians do.</p>  \n\
  <p>The discipline of history is faced with the irretrievable absence of the past. There are only <i>traces</i> in the present which become \xE2\x80\x9Cevidence\xE2\x80\x9D only under a theory. \xE2\x80\x9CExplanations of descriptions of events in paradigmatic historiography are ... the best explanation of a range of evidence, given background information and theories\xE2\x80\x9D (188). Consequently \xE2\x80\x9Cthe actual theories and methods that historians use habitually are about the transmission of information over time, from event to evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (21), i.e., \xE2\x80\x9Cinference from evidence to a common cause\xE2\x80\x9D (21). \xE2\x80\x9CHistorians are interested only in particular types of causal chains, the ones that preserve information\xE2\x80\x9D (94), but \xE2\x80\x9Cthe selection of evidence according to its information-preserving qualities is theory-laden\xE2\x80\x9D (106); only theory elucidates how evidence shows information-preservation or <i>fidelity</i>. \xE2\x80\x9CHistorians must use theories to know where to search for relevant evidence, to recognize relevant evidence once they discover it, and to interpret nested evidence to generate the kind of evidence that is useful for them\xE2\x80\x9D (95). Thus, \xE2\x80\x9Cconfirmation and explanation require more than historiography and evidence; they require theories that connect historiography with evidence and identify the evidence as such in the first place\xE2\x80\x9D (93).</p>  \n\
  <p>The theoretical core of \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific historiography\xE2\x80\x9D is \xE2\x80\x9Cinferring the information-causal chains that connect the cause, the alleged source of the information, with its effects, the alleged receptors of the information\xE2\x80\x9D (74). The decisive role of Fred Dretske\xE2\x80\x99s information-theory of epistemology is clear in this formulation. Equally central is Tucker\xE2\x80\x99s fervent Bayesianism. Bayesian theory establishes \xE2\x80\x9Cthe degree of probability the evidence confers on the hypothesis,\xE2\x80\x9D hence it is central to \xE2\x80\x9Cwarranting claims based on partial evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (96). Four times Tucker affirms that Bayesianism \xE2\x80\x9Cis the best explanation of the actual practices of historians\xE2\x80\x9D (96; see 21; 120; 134). Clearly historians do not actually calculate Bayesian probability; presumably it is tacit in their reasoning. That is, even if not quantifiable precisely, the order of magnitude of difference in the probability of separate causes relative to a common cause can be sufficient. Tucker acknowledges: \xE2\x80\x9CHistorians do not quantify fidelities... Since there is no set of algorithms for evaluating fidelities, historians exclude evidence that does not achieve a threshold of fidelity for whatever reason\xE2\x80\x9D (121). Hence the importance of corroborating evidence (114). \xE2\x80\x9CHistorians .. must bootstrap their evaluations of the fidelity of particular evidence by other evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (123). The distrust of an uncorroborated evidential claim is \xE2\x80\x9Ctaught as part of the historiographic guild\xE2\x80\x99s right [<i>sic</i>] of passage\xE2\x80\x9D (123).</p>  \n\
  <p>True, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe immediate, primary, subject matter of historiography is evidence and not events\xE2\x80\x9D (18), but only in the sense that without the evidence, the very possibility of description of events vanishes. A better starting point is Tucker\xE2\x80\x99s statement that his philosophy of historiography divides matters \xE2\x80\x9Cinto evidence, hypotheses, and theories about the transmission of information from events to evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (240). The <i>theories</i> which raise historical practice to \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D status concern the transmission of evidence, but the <i>hypotheses</i> which preoccupy historians have to do with the descriptions of events the evidence can warrant.</p>  \n\
  <p>Tucker contends that philosophy can discriminate in historical practice a \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific core\xE2\x80\x9D but that historical practice is not <i>altogether</i> a normal science. Rather, it is a compound of \xE2\x80\x9C<i>normal science</i>, the Rankean paradigm, and <i>traditionalist science</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (167). The sorts of questions that can be determinately answered in historiography are not sufficient to address the <i>pragmatic</i> concerns that drive historical inquiry, and therefore historians <i>must</i> supplement \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D with \xE2\x80\x9Ctraditional\xE2\x80\x9D concerns, develop hypotheses, however tentative or vague, which supplement cognitive with \xE2\x80\x9Ctherapeutic\xE2\x80\x9D values. A characteristic feature of this historiographical practice is that it achieves ad hoc accuracy at the expense of theoretical scope. The latter element in historical practice, in his view, accounts for the considerable disagreement among practicing historians.</p>  \n\
  <p>Tucker holds such conflict of opinions cannot be reduced to \xE2\x80\x9Cideological or cultural biases or economic and social interests\xE2\x80\x9D (141). Instead, the notion of underdetermination plays the major role in Tucker\xE2\x80\x99s theory of historical practice. \xE2\x80\x9CCognitive values may not be sufficient for discriminating among some historiographic hypotheses, and inconsistent evidence may not disprove some historiographic theories because historians add different ad hoc hypotheses to save them\xE2\x80\x9D (146). That is no license for radical incommensurability, or the indeterminacy thesis regarding historical knowledge (179; 258). \xE2\x80\x9CInsufficient evidence does not imply that historiography is indeterminate, that anything goes, because the evidence may still be sufficient for eliminating many improbable hypotheses, while conferring equal probability on several competing underdetermined historiographic hypotheses\xE2\x80\x9D (142). Thus, \xE2\x80\x9Conce the requirements of the cognitive values are satisfied, there is ample space for personal interpretations, value judgments, and expositions of value-laden meaning and significance\xE2\x80\x9D (42). Here is where, according to Tucker, historical practice supplements \xE2\x80\x9Cknowledge\xE2\x80\x9D with \xE2\x80\x9Cinterpretation.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \n\
  <p>Faced with underdetermination, historians split into schools constituted by interests and affiliations which are extra-scientific, and \xE2\x80\x9Cthe subsequent academic politics of interschool rivalry leads historians to deny, suppress, or misrepresent the social and semantic fragmentation in historiography\xE2\x80\x9D (168), which is in fact \xE2\x80\x9Ccriss-crossed by divisions between vertical school-theories and horizontal subfields\xE2\x80\x9D (169). Tucker asks whether this \xE2\x80\x9Ctraditionalist,\xE2\x80\x9D underdetermined dimension of historiography can ever be rendered \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific,\xE2\x80\x9D i.e., included in \xE2\x80\x9Cnormal science,\xE2\x80\x9D so that historical practice might more closely approximate the physical sciences. He examines the attempts of comparative history to develop \xE2\x80\x9Ca historiography that can determine accurate theories of broad scope without an increase in complexity by broadening the evidential base to include information-preserving effects of similar processes that originated across historical space and time\xE2\x80\x9D (153). He concludes, pessimistically, that its \xE2\x80\x9Cdifficulties ... demonstrates [<i>sic</i>] the entrenched reasons for historiographic underdetermination\xE2\x80\x9D (153). For Tucker, \xE2\x80\x9Cunique hypotheses limit the scope of scientific historiography because they cannot form together a theory of history that would connect disparate confirmed hypotheses of limited scope to form a large scope simple theory of social change\xE2\x80\x9D (261). But it is not clear that the discipline of history is after a \xE2\x80\x9Cgeneral theory of social change\xE2\x80\x9D (164). In fact, Tucker recognizes that \xE2\x80\x9Cmost practicing historians are not grand theoreticians. They confront a limited range of evidence and attempt to explain it while being inspired in their precise ad hoc modeling by their interpretation of a vague theoretical background\xE2\x80\x9D (163-4) drawn largely from philosophy and social science.</p>  \n\
  <p>Tucker makes two important and overlapping distinctions between historical practice and the natural sciences. First, in natural science, \xE2\x80\x9Cevidence is idealized to fit the theory\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 he calls this \xE2\x80\x9Cstandardization\xE2\x80\x9D-- whereas in historical practice, \xE2\x80\x9Ctheories ... are modified ad hoc to fit particular evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (21; see 164). Second, Tucker distinguishes the pursuit of a common cause <i>type</i> from the pursuit of a common cause <i>token</i> (101). He writes:</p>  <blockquote>The sciences are divided neither into human sciences and natural sciences according to their subject matters, nor into ideographic [sic] and nomothetic sciences according to the purpose of their inquiries, but between sciences that examine the similar effects of common tokens of causes that preserve information about their common causes and sciences that examine the similar effects of shared types of causes. (260)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>What both these overlapping distinctions indicate is that there is something distinctive, after all, to the concern with concrete individuals (\xE2\x80\x9Ctokens\xE2\x80\x9D) \xE2\x80\x93 not only in historical practice, but in all the allied pursuits, including evolutionary biology in the natural sciences. What needs to be captured in the latter fields is not some universal generalization but rather the concrete instance or path (event or process). Of course, no concept can ever express fully a concrete particular; nor can there ever be a complete description: <i>all</i> scientists \xE2\x80\x9Cdescribe and explain only aspects of events that fit their theories\xE2\x80\x9D (242).</p>  \n\
  <p>Still, in appraising the fit of evidence with theory, historical practice \xE2\x80\x9Cis not substantially different from biology, geology, or physics\xE2\x80\x9D (8). A \xE2\x80\x9Ccolligatory concept\xE2\x80\x9D in historiography is not epistemologically different from a theoretical term in physical science: \xE2\x80\x9CThere is no difference between the use of such theoretical concepts to explain evidence and the use scientists make of theoretical, unobservable concepts to explain a range of evidence... Neither the atom nor the Renaissance are directly observable; they are extremely useful and well-confirmed theoretical concepts\xE2\x80\x9D (138). Thus, \xE2\x80\x9Canother advantage of the Bayesian interpretation of historiography is the elimination of apparent historiographic anomalies when compared to science\xE2\x80\x9D (137). In keeping with the Quinean formulation that \xE2\x80\x9Chistoriography, as a science, is holistic, it presents a net of beliefs, connected to evidence at its rims\xE2\x80\x9D (120), Tucker argues that in historical inquiry epistemological confidence does not translate directly into any ontological fixity. Tucker argues there is no epistemological difference (i.e., relative to evidence) between ontological realism and constructionism in scientific historiography: \xE2\x80\x9Cdetermined constructionism ... fits determined historiography as evidence just as well as a realist interpretation\xE2\x80\x9D (257). Where constructionism seems more persuasive than realism is in the not-insignificant domain of underdetermined historiography.</p>  \n\
  <p>One final, admittedly irascible point: Tucker acknowledges that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe philosophy of historiography must rely on the cognitive values and theories of historiography to discover the historical emergence of the conditions of historiographic knowledge, the self-same cognitive values and theories\xE2\x80\x9D (47), yet Tucker nonetheless believes philosophers are able to theorize more clearly what historians are about than historians themselves. To whom is \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy of historiography\xE2\x80\x9D addressed, I wonder, and why? Philosophers often express impatience with historians for not being interested in their treatments of history. They complain that \xE2\x80\x9Chistorians who deny the use of theory are unaware of the theoretical underpinnings of their own practices\xE2\x80\x9D (83). To call historical practice scientific \xE2\x80\x9Cis not to imply that all historians who have practiced successfully the critical method have understood the theoretical foundations for their methods\xE2\x80\x9D (83). \xE2\x80\x9CIt is possible to use a method with confidence both following an understanding of the theory behind it, and because it has worked thus far\xE2\x80\x9D (83). This second, guild-practice model is distasteful to Tucker: the contention that historiography might be an <i>art</i> to be learned by a prolonged apprenticeship rather than through theoretical inculcation he dismisses as \xE2\x80\x9Cesotericism\xE2\x80\x9D (19). Since \xE2\x80\x9Cthe professional self-consciousness of historians ... is often false,\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy must always ask \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat historians or scientists are doing, not what they think they are doing,\xE2\x80\x9D lest the \xE2\x80\x9Cmeek acceptance of historiographic self-consciousness\xE2\x80\x9D make the practice appear \xE2\x80\x9Cmore rational and coherent that it actually is.\xE2\x80\x9D Philosophy undertakes not a \xE2\x80\x9Cphenomenology of disciplinary practitioners,\xE2\x80\x9D but a description of \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat [the discipline is] actually like.\xE2\x80\x9D (4-5) Actual historiographical disputes often fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements for competing explanations (192). \xE2\x80\x9CHistorians do not realize that their opponents explain a different topic and use different comparison situations\xE2\x80\x9D (194). With so much that we don\xE2\x80\x99t understand about what we are doing, how fortunate for us that we have philosophers to make it all clear!</p>"

Hence the importance of corroborating evidence (114). \xE2\x80\x9CHistorians .. must bootstrap their evaluations of the fidelity of particular evidence by other evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (123). The distrust of an uncorroborated evidential claim is \xE2\x80\x9Ctaught as part of the historiographic guild\xE2\x80\x99s right [<i>sic</i>] of passage\xE2\x80\x9D (123).</p>  \n\
  <p>True, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe immediate, primary, subject matter of historiography is evidence and not events\xE2\x80\x9D (18), but only in the sense that without the evidence, the very possibility of description of events vanishes. A better starting point is Tucker\xE2\x80\x99s statement that his philosophy of historiography divides matters \xE2\x80\x9Cinto evidence, hypotheses, and theories about the transmission of information from events to evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (240). The <i>theories</i> which raise historical practice to \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D status concern the transmission of evidence, but the <i>hypotheses</i> which preoccupy historians have to do with the descriptions of events the evidence can warrant.</p>  \n\
  <p>Tucker contends that philosophy can discriminate in historical practice a \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific core\xE2\x80\x9D but that historical practice is not <i>altogether</i> a normal science. Rather, it is a compound of \xE2\x80\x9C<i>normal science</i>, the Rankean paradigm, and <i>traditionalist science</i>\xE2\x80\x9D (167). The sorts of questions that can be determinately answered in historiography are not sufficient to address the <i>pragmatic</i> concerns that drive historical inquiry, and therefore historians <i>must</i> supplement \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D with \xE2\x80\x9Ctraditional\xE2\x80\x9D concerns, develop hypotheses, however tentative or vague, which supplement cognitive with \xE2\x80\x9Ctherapeutic\xE2\x80\x9D values. A characteristic feature of this historiographical practice is that it achieves ad hoc accuracy at the expense of theoretical scope. The latter element in historical practice, in his view, accounts for the considerable disagreement among practicing historians.</p>  \n\
  <p>Tucker holds such conflict of opinions cannot be reduced to \xE2\x80\x9Cideological or cultural biases or economic and social interests\xE2\x80\x9D (141). Instead, the notion of underdetermination plays the major role in Tucker\xE2\x80\x99s theory of historical practice. \xE2\x80\x9CCognitive values may not be sufficient for discriminating among some historiographic hypotheses, and inconsistent evidence may not disprove some historiographic theories because historians add different ad hoc hypotheses to save them\xE2\x80\x9D (146). That is no license for radical incommensurability, or the indeterminacy thesis regarding historical knowledge (179; 258). \xE2\x80\x9CInsufficient evidence does not imply that historiography is indeterminate, that anything goes, because the evidence may still be sufficient for eliminating many improbable hypotheses, while conferring equal probability on several competing underdetermined historiographic hypotheses\xE2\x80\x9D (142). Thus, \xE2\x80\x9Conce the requirements of the cognitive values are satisfied, there is ample space for personal interpretations, value judgments, and expositions of value-laden meaning and significance\xE2\x80\x9D (42). Here is where, according to Tucker, historical practice supplements \xE2\x80\x9Cknowledge\xE2\x80\x9D with \xE2\x80\x9Cinterpretation.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>  \n\
  <p>Faced with underdetermination, historians split into schools constituted by interests and affiliations which are extra-scientific, and \xE2\x80\x9Cthe subsequent academic politics of interschool rivalry leads historians to deny, suppress, or misrepresent the social and semantic fragmentation in historiography\xE2\x80\x9D (168), which is in fact \xE2\x80\x9Ccriss-crossed by divisions between vertical school-theories and horizontal subfields\xE2\x80\x9D (169). Tucker asks whether this \xE2\x80\x9Ctraditionalist,\xE2\x80\x9D underdetermined dimension of historiography can ever be rendered \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific,\xE2\x80\x9D i.e., included in \xE2\x80\x9Cnormal science,\xE2\x80\x9D so that historical practice might more closely approximate the physical sciences. He examines the attempts of comparative history to develop \xE2\x80\x9Ca historiography that can determine accurate theories of broad scope without an increase in complexity by broadening the evidential base to include information-preserving effects of similar processes that originated across historical space and time\xE2\x80\x9D (153). He concludes, pessimistically, that its \xE2\x80\x9Cdifficulties ... demonstrates [<i>sic</i>] the entrenched reasons for historiographic underdetermination\xE2\x80\x9D (153). For Tucker, \xE2\x80\x9Cunique hypotheses limit the scope of scientific historiography because they cannot form together a theory of history that would connect disparate confirmed hypotheses of limited scope to form a large scope simple theory of social change\xE2\x80\x9D (261). But it is not clear that the discipline of history is after a \xE2\x80\x9Cgeneral theory of social change\xE2\x80\x9D (164). In fact, Tucker recognizes that \xE2\x80\x9Cmost practicing historians are not grand theoreticians. They confront a limited range of evidence and attempt to explain it while being inspired in their precise ad hoc modeling by their interpretation of a vague theoretical background\xE2\x80\x9D (163-4) drawn largely from philosophy and social science.</p>  \n\
  <p>Tucker makes two important and overlapping distinctions between historical practice and the natural sciences. First, in natural science, \xE2\x80\x9Cevidence is idealized to fit the theory\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 he calls this \xE2\x80\x9Cstandardization\xE2\x80\x9D-- whereas in historical practice, \xE2\x80\x9Ctheories ... are modified ad hoc to fit particular evidence\xE2\x80\x9D (21; see 164). Second, Tucker distinguishes the pursuit of a common cause <i>type</i> from the pursuit of a common cause <i>token</i> (101). He writes:</p>  <blockquote>The sciences are divided neither into human sciences and natural sciences according to their subject matters, nor into ideographic [sic] and nomothetic sciences according to the purpose of their inquiries, but between sciences that examine the similar effects of common tokens of causes that preserve information about their common causes and sciences that examine the similar effects of shared types of causes. (260)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>What both these overlapping distinctions indicate is that there is something distinctive, after all, to the concern with concrete individuals (\xE2\x80\x9Ctokens\xE2\x80\x9D) \xE2\x80\x93 not only in historical practice, but in all the allied pursuits, including evolutionary biology in the natural sciences. What needs to be captured in the latter fields is not some universal generalization but rather the concrete instance or path (event or process). Of course, no concept can ever express fully a concrete particular; nor can there ever be a complete description: <i>all</i> scientists \xE2\x80\x9Cdescribe and explain only aspects of events that fit their theories\xE2\x80\x9D (242).</p>  \n\
  <p>Still, in appraising the fit of evidence with theory, historical practice \xE2\x80\x9Cis not substantially different from biology, geology, or physics\xE2\x80\x9D (8). A \xE2\x80\x9Ccolligatory concept\xE2\x80\x9D in historiography is not epistemologically different from a theoretical term in physical science: \xE2\x80\x9CThere is no difference between the use of such theoretical concepts to explain evidence and the use scientists make of theoretical, unobservable concepts to explain a range of evidence... Neither the atom nor the Renaissance are directly observable; they are extremely useful and well-confirmed theoretical concepts\xE2\x80\x9D (138). Thus, \xE2\x80\x9Canother advantage of the Bayesian interpretation of historiography is the elimination of apparent historiographic anomalies when compared to science\xE2\x80\x9D (137). In keeping with the Quinean formulation that \xE2\x80\x9Chistoriography, as a science, is holistic, it presents a net of beliefs, connected to evidence at its rims\xE2\x80\x9D (120), Tucker argues that in historical inquiry epistemological confidence does not translate directly into any ontological fixity. Tucker argues there is no epistemological difference (i.e., relative to evidence) between ontological realism and constructionism in scientific historiography: \xE2\x80\x9Cdetermined constructionism ... fits determined historiography as evidence just as well as a realist interpretation\xE2\x80\x9D (257). Where constructionism seems more persuasive than realism is in the not-insignificant domain of underdetermined historiography.</p>  \n\
  <p>One final, admittedly irascible point: Tucker acknowledges that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe philosophy of historiography must rely on the cognitive values and theories of historiography to discover the historical emergence of the conditions of historiographic knowledge, the self-same cognitive values and theories\xE2\x80\x9D (47), yet Tucker nonetheless believes philosophers are able to theorize more clearly what historians are about than historians themselves. To whom is \xE2\x80\x9Cphilosophy of historiography\xE2\x80\x9D addressed, I wonder, and why? Philosophers often express impatience with historians for not being interested in their treatments of history. They complain that \xE2\x80\x9Chistorians who deny the use of theory are unaware of the theoretical underpinnings of their own practices\xE2\x80\x9D (83). To call historical practice scientific \xE2\x80\x9Cis not to imply that all historians who have practiced successfully the critical method have understood the theoretical foundations for their methods\xE2\x80\x9D (83). \xE2\x80\x9CIt is possible to use a method with confidence both following an understanding of the theory behind it, and because it has worked thus far\xE2\x80\x9D (83). This second, guild-practice model is distasteful to Tucker: the contention that historiography might be an <i>art</i> to be learned by a prolonged apprenticeship rather than through theoretical inculcation he dismisses as \xE2\x80\x9Cesotericism\xE2\x80\x9D (19). Since \xE2\x80\x9Cthe professional self-consciousness of historians ... is often false,\xE2\x80\x9D philosophy must always ask \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat historians or scientists are doing, not what they think they are doing,\xE2\x80\x9D lest the \xE2\x80\x9Cmeek acceptance of historiographic self-consciousness\xE2\x80\x9D make the practice appear \xE2\x80\x9Cmore rational and coherent that it actually is.\xE2\x80\x9D Philosophy undertakes not a \xE2\x80\x9Cphenomenology of disciplinary practitioners,\xE2\x80\x9D but a description of \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat [the discipline is] actually like.\xE2\x80\x9D (4-5) Actual historiographical disputes often fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements for competing explanations (192). \xE2\x80\x9CHistorians do not realize that their opponents explain a different topic and use different comparison situations\xE2\x80\x9D (194). With so much that we don\xE2\x80\x99t understand about what we are doing, how fortunate for us that we have philosophers to make it all clear!</p>"
