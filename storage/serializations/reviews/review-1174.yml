content: "<p>This study of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Tractatus</i> [TLP] builds on and, in several important respects, goes beyond recent, controversial reinterpretations of the early Wittgenstein by Cora Diamond and Juliet Floyd. The most welcome innovation that Ostrow offers is a careful consideration of the details of the text itself, including Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of states of affairs, facts, pictures, logical analysis and the essence of the proposition. These discussions allow Ostrow to clarify one way in which we can take seriously Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s remark towards the end of the <i>Tractatus</i> that \xE2\x80\x9CMy propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them \xE2\x80\x93 as steps \xE2\x80\x93 to climb up beyond them\xE2\x80\x9D (TLP 6.54). Despite his considerable innovations, however, I believe that much more work is needed to show that Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation is correct.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CIntroduction\xE2\x80\x9D helpfully situates his interpretation of the <i>Tractatus</i> in the range of major interpretations offered to date. On the one side are the more traditional interpretations of the <i>Tractatus</i> given by writers such as Pears, Anscombe and Hacker. They all attempt to downplay the significance or the scope of the book\xE2\x80\x99s peculiar conclusion. According to Ostrow, Pears interprets Wittgenstein as offering a philosophical account of the world, language and logic, and so Pears must completely dismiss 6.54 as a mistake or misguided. Others, such as Anscombe, take 6.54\xE2\x80\x99s use of the term \xE2\x80\x9Cnonsense\xE2\x80\x9D in a peculiar way. \xE2\x80\x9CNonsense\xE2\x80\x9D indicates only that what is communicated in the book goes beyond what can be said, where \xE2\x80\x9Csaid\xE2\x80\x9D is understood in terms of the previously developed theory of saying and showing. While such an approach can accommodate 6.54, it still faces the challenge of articulating exactly how this kind of nonsense can communicate something that cannot be straightforwardly said.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Ostrow rejects both of these interpretative strategies and sides with the more radical proposals of Cora Diamond. Beginning with her paper \xE2\x80\x9CThrowing Away the Ladder\xE2\x80\x9D, Diamond argued that 6.54 requires that we take all of the <i>Tractatus</i> leading up to 6.54 to be \xE2\x80\x9Cjust so much gibberish\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 5).<sup><a name=\"1b\" href=\"#1\">1</a></sup> The burden on this proposal is, of course, to explain why someone would spend so much time writing and publishing something that was complete nonsense. Diamond, and other interpreters such as Floyd and Conant, have argued that the <i>Tractatus</i> has a \xE2\x80\x9Ctherapeutic intent\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 7) to bring the reader to see the hopelessness of traditional philosophy and its problems. These readings do have the salutary effect of downplaying the divisions between the early and later Wittgenstein, but to date have yet to present a fully satisfying picture of how straightforward nonsense can be philosophically therapeutic.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Ostrow can be seen as taking the next step along the road set by Diamond as he claims, paradoxically, that \xE2\x80\x9Ca sentence like \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99The world is everything that is the case\xE2\x80\x99 is nonsense\xE2\x80\x9D is <i>itself</i> nonsense\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 10). Thus, his interpretation is a \xE2\x80\x98dialectical\xE2\x80\x99 interpretation because he reads Wittgenstein as taking up a host of philosophical terms, and showing for each of them how what appeared to be a clearly understood term was in fact nonsensical. There are no significant exceptions to this critical project, though, and so terms like \xE2\x80\x9Cnonsense\xE2\x80\x9D themselves are eventually criticized. The point of all this for Ostrow is to liberate the reader from philosophy by vigorously engaging in a range of philosophical projects and showing that they are futile. He reads the <i>Tractatus</i>, then, in a way that many of us have learned to read Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s later <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. In both texts, at each point a philosophical position or problem is shown to be based on confusion or error.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s book is divided into four chapters, where his interpretation is supported by considering some of the major topics of the book. Chapter I, \xE2\x80\x9CPictures and logical atomism\xE2\x80\x9D, focuses on the metaphysics of objects, states of affairs and facts that Wittgenstein presents in the opening sections of the <i>Tractatus</i>, and some parts of the explanation of picturing. Chapter II, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is analysis?\xE2\x80\x9D, considers Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s account of logical analysis, e.g. when a proposition is analyzed into its logical components. Chapter III, \xE2\x80\x9CThe essence of the proposition\xE2\x80\x9D, concerns the general form of the proposition and the connection to Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s explanation of logical inference. Finally, chapter IV, \xE2\x80\x9CThe liberating word\xE2\x80\x9D, summarizes the aim of the book in light of the previous chapters\xE2\x80\x99 investigations. Ostrow argues for a fundamentally ethical aim for the <i>Tractatus</i> by connecting philosophy with an alienation from the world: \xE2\x80\x9CIf, for the <i>Tractatus</i>, philosophy comes to stand for our fundamental estrangement from the world, it is then in the disappearance of philosophy that our redemption lies\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 133).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>A summary of chapter II will hopefully convey the flavor of Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s general approach. Wittgenstein says</p>  \t\t <blockquote>In a proposition a thought can be expressed in such a way that elements of the propositional sign correspond to the objects of the thought.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>I call such elements \xE2\x80\x98simple signs\xE2\x80\x99, and such a proposition \xE2\x80\x98completely analysed\xE2\x80\x99.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>The simple signs employed in a proposition are called names.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>A name means an object. The object is its meaning. (\xE2\x80\x98A\xE2\x80\x99 is the same sign as \xE2\x80\x98A\xE2\x80\x99.)</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>The configuration in a situation corresponds to the configuration of simple signs in the propositional sign. (TLP 3.2-3.21)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>No propositions of ordinary language are completely analyzed in this sense, and this has led many commentators to see Wittgenstein as making a substantial philosophical claim here about the possibility of either constructing a logically perfect language or carrying out a complete analysis of the propositions of ordinary language. Ostrow argues for a quite different purpose in these remarks through a consideration of the ordinary claim \xE2\x80\x9CThe watch is lying on the table\xE2\x80\x9D. An analysis of this proposition would initially lead to an existentially quantified statement:</p>  \t\t <blockquote>if the watch in the above example could be completely characterized in terms of a description of the color (C) and shape (S) of its parts, then the analysis of the proposition asserting that the watch is lying on the table \xE2\x80\x93 assuming the phrase \xE2\x80\x9Clying on the table\xE2\x80\x9D (L) could be understood as indicating a form \xE2\x80\x93 would begin with an existentially quantified statement of the form: \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x88\x83x (Cx & Sx &amp; Lx).\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 56)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This, in turn, would yield a series of propositions for each of the possibilities compatible with the truth of the original claim.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Such an understanding of logical analysis is only the first step for Ostrow. For a complete analysis must terminate in names, and a reflection on what names are and how they are exposed in analysis greatly complicates the whole project. Here Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s version of Frege\xE2\x80\x99s context principle is crucial, as it shows us that names are signs that appear in a whole collection of propositions: \xE2\x80\x9CWe understand a meaning only when we look at <i>how</i> the propositional sign functions within a whole class of propositions\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 62). And, this in turn leads us to see that a complete analysis will involve rewriting a proposition in terms of various coordinate systems where names as traditionally understood designate a place within these systems. The systems themselves make naming possible, but they cannot themselves be named. For example, in the watch case \xE2\x80\x9CThe forms of color and spatial position are thus absorbed into my method of representation; they become part of the means by which I can describe the world rather than further elements that themselves have linguistic representatives\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 68).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This leads Ostrow to see in \xE2\x80\x9CThe sign determines a logical form only together with its logical-syntactical application\xE2\x80\x9D (TLP 3.327) an invocation to focus primarily on the use of propositional signs by individuals. The correct analysis of a proposition depends on the use that we put it to. Here, though, we do not have a traditional philosophical claim about language, but rather only an attempt \xE2\x80\x9Cto make evident the nature of the logico-philosophical inquiry itself\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 70). For in getting us to realize that logical analysis is dependent on our use of language, and not on any deep metaphysical facts about the world, Wittgenstein is seen to be undermining the kind of logico-metaphysical investigations associated with Frege\xE2\x80\x99s rigid division between concepts and objects or with Russell\xE2\x80\x99s elaborate theory of types. Both of these approaches are rejected by Wittgenstein because they fail to take seriously the problematic character of philosophical investigation itself. Instead, for Wittgenstein,</p>  \t\t <blockquote>what begins as an attempt to specify the necessary features of the world ends with the recognition that these extend as far as our language itself, that the \xE2\x80\x9Cspecification\xE2\x80\x9D can be no more than an acknowledgement that we speak, sometimes with sense, sometimes nonsensically (p. 72).</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The project of logical analysis is itself undermined and with it the whole cadre of philosophical terms such as \xE2\x80\x9Cobject\xE2\x80\x9D, \xE2\x80\x9Cfact\xE2\x80\x9D, \xE2\x80\x9Ccomplex\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cnumber\xE2\x80\x9D that go along with it.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>In several instances, then, what appear to be straightforward philosophical claims about the world, language or logic are argued to be rather invitations to reflect on traditional philosophical claims and projects. In each case Ostrow finds in the text the materials to show how these philosophical projects are frustrated. He is thus able to handle not only 6.54, but also Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s programmatic remarks about philosophy such as \xE2\x80\x9CPhilosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity\xE2\x80\x9D (4.112). By working through several key stages of the text, and by extending the scope of what is nonsensical to ascriptions of nonsense themselves, Ostrow has made an important contribution to the interpretative line occupied by Diamond, Floyd and Conant.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Despite these advantages, Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s book suffers from several flaws. To begin with a minor one, the book will be all but incomprehensible to someone who has not worked through the <i>Tractatus</i> and several commentaries. Ostrow often launches into intricate rereadings of key passages of the text without discussing the context in which these passages appear. While alternative interpretations of the <i>Tractatus</i> are discussed in the introduction, in the text itself there is little or no argumentation against other interpretations. Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s book, then, is certainly not suitable as an introduction to the <i>Tractatus</i>, and will be of use only to specialists in the <i>Tractatus</i>.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>A narrow intended audience alone is not a serious flaw, though. What is more unsettling are the frequent interpretative leaps that Ostrow makes in his discussion. For example, it is quite difficult to accept both that 3.327 is an invitation to focus on our use of language and that Wittgenstein made this recommendation to get us to reflect on philosophy itself. Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s solipsism seems to preclude any serious concern with our use of language, and there is little evidence in the text that this remark is meant to have any kind of metaphilosophical purpose. Rather, Wittgenstein seems to be making a technical distinction between a sign and a symbol and noting that we can only determine which sign is which symbol if we include how it is used to represent to world.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This leads me to Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s admittedly frank confession to have given \xE2\x80\x9Cshort shrift to the <i>Tractatus</i>\xE2\x80\x99 discussions of number, probability, scientific theory, the propositional attitudes and solipsism\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 16). These topics are crucial because they are discussed in the 5s and 6s that lead up to 6.54, the lynchpin of Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s entire interpretation. It is a remarkable consequence of Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation that mathematics, scientific laws and philosophy are all nonsense. Given Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s longstanding interest in the philosophy of mathematics and science, it simply defies belief that claims such as</p>  \t\t <blockquote>The propositions of mathematics are equations, and therefore pseudo-propositions (TLP 6.2)</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>If there were a law of causality, it might be put in the following way: There are laws of nature.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>But of course that cannot be said: it makes itself manifest. (TLP 6.36)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>have no meaningful philosophical content.<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> These are the most difficult parts of the <i>Tractatus</i> for Ostrow to handle, and until he does so his interpretation cannot be accepted.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>An alternative interpretation of the <i>Tractatus</i> might take seriously the various roles that Wittgenstein attributes to mathematical, ethical, psychological and law-like claims. While each of these types of claims falls short of saying anything in the restricted sense of \xE2\x80\x9Csaying\xE2\x80\x9D described in the <i>Tractatus</i>, they all have some genuine use. Furthermore, Wittgenstein appears to present philosophy as the activity of separating out the different kinds of uses of language when he says, \xE2\x80\x9CPhilosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts\xE2\x80\x9D (TLP 4.112).<sup><a name=\"3b\" href=\"#3\">3</a></sup> \t\t</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This point highlights a more fundamental difficulty with Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s methodology, and this difficulty extends, I believe, also to the work of Diamond, Floyd and Conant. In attempting to link 6.54 with the later Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s supposedly anti-philosophical methodology, they have given up any attempt to take the <i>Tractatus</i>\xE2\x80\x99 own historical context seriously. The views of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s contemporaries besides Frege and Russell are scarcely mentioned and the possible sources of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s own views are never explored. Rather, we are given an investigation of a disembodied text. I fear that until we situate the <i>Tractatus</i> better in its own time and place, we will make little progress in reconstructing its intended content.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

  <p>A summary of chapter II will hopefully convey the flavor of Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s general approach. Wittgenstein says</p>  \t\t <blockquote>In a proposition a thought can be expressed in such a way that elements of the propositional sign correspond to the objects of the thought.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>I call such elements \xE2\x80\x98simple signs\xE2\x80\x99, and such a proposition \xE2\x80\x98completely analysed\xE2\x80\x99.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>The simple signs employed in a proposition are called names.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>A name means an object. The object is its meaning. (\xE2\x80\x98A\xE2\x80\x99 is the same sign as \xE2\x80\x98A\xE2\x80\x99.)</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>The configuration in a situation corresponds to the configuration of simple signs in the propositional sign. (TLP 3.2-3.21)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>No propositions of ordinary language are completely analyzed in this sense, and this has led many commentators to see Wittgenstein as making a substantial philosophical claim here about the possibility of either constructing a logically perfect language or carrying out a complete analysis of the propositions of ordinary language.

  <p>This, in turn, would yield a series of propositions for each of the possibilities compatible with the truth of the original claim.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Such an understanding of logical analysis is only the first step for Ostrow. For a complete analysis must terminate in names, and a reflection on what names are and how they are exposed in analysis greatly complicates the whole project.

  <p>Despite these advantages, Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s book suffers from several flaws. To begin with a minor one, the book will be all but incomprehensible to someone who has not worked through the <i>Tractatus</i> and several commentaries. Ostrow often launches into intricate rereadings of key passages of the text without discussing the context in which these passages appear. While alternative interpretations of the <i>Tractatus</i> are discussed in the introduction, in the text itself there is little or no argumentation against other interpretations. Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s book, then, is certainly not suitable as an introduction to the <i>Tractatus</i>, and will be of use only to specialists in the <i>Tractatus</i>.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>A narrow intended audience alone is not a serious flaw, though. What is more unsettling are the frequent interpretative leaps that Ostrow makes in his discussion. For example, it is quite difficult to accept both that 3.327 is an invitation to focus on our use of language and that Wittgenstein made this recommendation to get us to reflect on philosophy itself. Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s solipsism seems to preclude any serious concern with our use of language, and there is little evidence in the text that this remark is meant to have any kind of metaphilosophical purpose. Rather, Wittgenstein seems to be making a technical distinction between a sign and a symbol and noting that we can only determine which sign is which symbol if we include how it is used to represent to world.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This leads me to Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s admittedly frank confession to have given \xE2\x80\x9Cshort shrift to the <i>Tractatus</i>\xE2\x80\x99 discussions of number, probability, scientific theory, the propositional attitudes and solipsism\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 16). These topics are crucial because they are discussed in the 5s and 6s that lead up to 6.54, the lynchpin of Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s entire interpretation. It is a remarkable consequence of Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation that mathematics, scientific laws and philosophy are all nonsense. Given Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s longstanding interest in the philosophy of mathematics and science, it simply defies belief that claims such as</p>  \t\t <blockquote>The propositions of mathematics are equations, and therefore pseudo-propositions (TLP 6.2)</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>If there were a law of causality, it might be put in the following way: There are laws of nature.</blockquote>  \t\t <blockquote>But of course that cannot be said: it makes itself manifest. (TLP 6.36)</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>have no meaningful philosophical content.<sup><a name=\"2b\" href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> These are the most difficult parts of the <i>Tractatus</i> for Ostrow to handle, and until he does so his interpretation cannot be accepted.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>An alternative interpretation of the <i>Tractatus</i> might take seriously the various roles that Wittgenstein attributes to mathematical, ethical, psychological and law-like claims. While each of these types of claims falls short of saying anything in the restricted sense of \xE2\x80\x9Csaying\xE2\x80\x9D described in the <i>Tractatus</i>, they all have some genuine use. Furthermore, Wittgenstein appears to present philosophy as the activity of separating out the different kinds of uses of language when he says, \xE2\x80\x9CPhilosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts\xE2\x80\x9D (TLP 4.112).<sup><a name=\"3b\" href=\"#3\">3</a></sup> \t\t</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This point highlights a more fundamental difficulty with Ostrow\xE2\x80\x99s methodology, and this difficulty extends, I believe, also to the work of Diamond, Floyd and Conant. In attempting to link 6.54 with the later Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s supposedly anti-philosophical methodology, they have given up any attempt to take the <i>Tractatus</i>\xE2\x80\x99 own historical context seriously. The views of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s contemporaries besides Frege and Russell are scarcely mentioned and the possible sources of Wittgenstein\xE2\x80\x99s own views are never explored. Rather, we are given an investigation of a disembodied text. I fear that until we situate the <i>Tractatus</i> better in its own time and place, we will make little progress in reconstructing its intended content.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\
