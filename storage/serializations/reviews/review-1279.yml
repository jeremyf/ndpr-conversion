content: "<p>This extremely interesting and well-written book is billed as an \xE2\x80\x9Cimportant new study of the foundations of modern political theory\xE2\x80\x9D. Authors probably shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be held responsible for their publisher\xE2\x80\x99s blurbs, but this immediately raises a series of questions and expectations. What counts as a \xE2\x80\x9Cfoundation\xE2\x80\x9D in the first place, and how can reading Hobbes, Locke, Grotius and Pufendorf contribute to our grasp of these foundations? It also suggests something like Quentin Skinner\xE2\x80\x99s project in his now classic <i>Foundations of Modern Political Thought</i>. For Skinner, the foundations of political thought were to be exposed historically in part to reveal their contingency\xE2\x80\x94which didn\xE2\x80\x99t necessarily mean they were arbitrary\xE2\x80\x94and to help us see the connections between philosophical arguments and contestable claims to social power. Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s project is more explicitly philosophical than Skinner\xE2\x80\x99s, in the sense that he is less concerned with detailed reconstruction of contexts and problems of power. But his philosophical claims about foundations are also built on a historical thesis.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The title of the book is taken from Shakespeare\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Macbeth</i>, and Macduff\xE2\x80\x99s lament for the murder of King Duncan, the consequence of which is that \xE2\x80\x9CConfusion now have made his masterpiece!\xE2\x80\x9D. For Harrison, Shakespeare\xE2\x80\x99s portrayal of the undermining of moral and political order provides a leitmotif for thinking about seventeenth century political philosophy in general. The greatest works of this century\xE2\x80\x94here meaning those of Hobbes and Locke\xE2\x80\x94emerged out of moral and political confusion. Religious disputes over the nature of belief and religious practice generated murderous civil and international conflict. Philosophical disputes, and especially the revival of ancient skepticism and newer forms of modern skepticism, sowed deep philosophical doubts about the possibility of knowledge, natural or otherwise. Older philosophical frameworks, such as Aristotelianism and Thomism, were found wanting, and philosophers struggled to find new arguments to arbitrate between various warring doctrines, or indeed to transcend them.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>For Harrison, skepticism is the most pressing moral and political problem faced by seventeenth century philosophy, and especially by Hobbes and Locke. And the problem of skepticism infects \xE2\x80\x9Cthe most fundamental \xE2\x80\xA6problem in political philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 the problem of political obligation (p. 13). At times Harrison seems to suggest these are still <i>our</i> problems, and that one way we gain insight into them is by seeing the various options for their resolution as presented by Hobbes, Locke, and Grotius, among others (pp. 4-5). We gain this kind of insight by taking the history of philosophy seriously, and especially the contexts within which moral and political arguments are formed. Not surprisingly, since these remain our problems, Hobbes emerges as the most clear-headed in this history since he seems most willing to bite the bullet when it comes to the clash between self-interest, politics and morality (263-4). We need politics (the commonwealth) to solve the moral problem, given his subjectivist account of what is good and bad and of moral judgment. In a lovely aside, Harrison tells us that at one point he contemplated calling the last chapter \xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the Use?\xE2\x80\x9D in order to \xE2\x80\x9Creflect more generally on the possibility of political philosophy and on the use for political philosophy of the historical philosophers I have been describing\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 245; the chapter is actually called \xE2\x80\x9CWhy Utility Pleases\xE2\x80\x99). His answer to this question is rather elusive, but I take it that it is Hobbes\xE2\x80\x9D insight about the need for politics to help solve our moral conflicts that Harrison is suggesting is the master stroke of the \xE2\x80\x9Cnew\xE2\x80\x9D natural law. This and the various attempts at refuting Hobbes\xE2\x80\x9D argument, such as Cumberland\xE2\x80\x99s, point to the \xE2\x80\x9Cbeginnings of the contractualist method\xE2\x80\x9D of discovering the good by discovering those things into which everyone would contract (262). Harrison even suggests that Locke gestures at something like it in his 1692 note \xE2\x80\x9CEthica A\xE2\x80\x9D (263). But in another much bleaker note written the following year (which Harrison doesn\xE2\x80\x99t cite), Locke suggests that without God and his divine law what we get is moral chaos. Harrison admits that Locke is only \xE2\x80\x9Cwaving\xE2\x80\x9D at something about which Hobbes is much clearer.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>As it stands, the main claims of the book are hardly novel. The central focus on skepticism fits into a pattern of thinking about the history of the seventeenth century that has its roots in Kantian and post-Kantian philosophy, and which has been central to the work of historians of philosophy like Richard Popkin, amongst others. Richard Tuck and Knud Haakonssen have also argued recently at great length and with great skill that the political thought of the seventeenth century\xE2\x80\x94especially that of Hobbes and Grotius\xE2\x80\x94was profoundly shaped by the challenge of skepticism mounted by writers such as Montaigne and Charron. But what is interesting about the book, at least for me, is the way it tries to balance historical and philosophical approaches to these questions in a manner not often attempted in the existing literature. To over-generalize somewhat, historically minded scholars often provide beautiful reconstructions of the context of an argument or period, but avoid asking the kinds of philosophical questions that inevitably emerge as one reflects on the relation between arguments then and now. On the other hand, and much more frequently, contemporary philosophers tend to wrench early modern arguments out of context altogether, and criticize or put them to work in modern guise without any hesitation whatsoever. Harrison tries to strike a balance between these two extremes, and it provides an interesting background for the work as a whole.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Let me say a bit more about this tension as a way of thinking about Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of normativity, which strikes me as lying at the heart of the book. Sometimes the history of philosophy is seen as a series of pale approximations building up to what we now know to be true. The history of early modern philosophy is particularly prone to this kind of distortion. Referring to the period beginning from the seventeenth century up to the French Revolution as <i>the</i> \xE2\x80\x9CAge of Enlightenment\xE2\x80\x9D only reinforces such a tendency. At some very general level it\xE2\x80\x99s undoubtedly true that this is an age of progress and genuine intellectual enlightenment. But just as many questions are raised as answered by taking on too sweeping a vision of this narrative. For one thing, it turns out that there isn\xE2\x80\x99t just one \xE2\x80\x9CEnlightenment\xE2\x80\x9D but many - early and late, \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Clow\xE2\x80\x99, radical and conservative, English and continental, etc. (see, for example, the work of Jonathan Israel, Tim Hochstrasser and Ian Hunter). Second, it is not even clear that we should assume that what we mean by philosophy today is what philosophers in the seventeenth century understood themselves to be doing. A basic assumption governing much of the writing of the history of philosophy since Kant has been that a theory of knowledge is at the core of philosophy (call it the \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemological paradigm\xE2\x80\x99, a phrase I borrow from Knud Haakonssen). Early modern philosophy seems to confirm this development, and especially the role played by someone like John Locke and his <i>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>. The struggle against skepticism defines the project of philosophy from the seventeenth century onwards. Thus political philosophy is either a form of \xE2\x80\x9Capplied philosophy\xE2\x80\x99, meaning the working out of various meta-ethical claims in different practical contexts, or it is a domain in which claims about morality are irrelevant, or at least ineffective. Philosophy is about justification, and political philosophy is either no different or it is not philosophy.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Now Harrison argues that political philosophy has essentially three tasks (247-252). First, the task of explanation, that is, \xE2\x80\x9Cpromoting understanding of political aspects of our (social) world\xE2\x80\x9D. Second, the \xE2\x80\x9Ctask of justification . . . we want to know why or whether we should have it, or in what way\xE2\x80\x99, and in this sense political philosophy is a normative subject, \xE2\x80\x9Ca part of applied ethics\xE2\x80\x9D (247). Third, it must explain motivation, that is, why people are or could be motivated to \xE2\x80\x9Cproduce\xE2\x80\x9D the desired outcomes or institutions. These various aspects can come apart and combine in various ways, as Harrison shows very nicely with regard to both Hobbes and Locke. But the crucial task for political philosophy is justification \xE2\x80\x93 in fact, the need for justification is entailed by the confusion caused by skepticism, and the responses by Hobbes and Locke are \xE2\x80\x9Cmasterpieces of justification\xE2\x80\x9D (252). The structure of justification that Harrison presupposes goes something like this. Rationally binding norms are either self-grounding, on the basis of some account of self-interest, moral realism, or a conception of man as a rational self-governing being, or they bind in virtue of the superior wisdom and/or power of God. Seventeenth century political philosophy is then taken to be a series of variations on these themes, and mainly variations of the latter. Hobbes is the exception that proves the rule, and that is why he seems most clear-headed from our modern perspective.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The dual commitment of Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s project is striking here. On the one hand, he wants to provide an historically sensitive account of the arguments of people like Hobbes, Grotius, Pufendorf, Locke, Cumberland and others. And on the other hand, he is arguing that the search for the foundations in political thought is best understood as a problem of philosophical justification, understood basically in terms of what I called the \xE2\x80\x9Cepistemological paradigm\xE2\x80\x9D. To be fair, he also talks about the important role of explanation and of motivation, but his main concerns are epistemological. How can we know the content of the natural law? On what grounds do we know it and in what sense does it bind? This reflects a deep ambiguity lying at the heart of Protestant natural law theory in general; the worry that if there was no moral continuity between Man and God, then it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t clear how reason could establish any link between man\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour and God\xE2\x80\x99s reward or punishment. So justification is obviously central to what Hobbes or Locke thought they were doing. But if our conception of justification is too narrow, then we risk leaving out an enormous amount out of what counted as political philosophy in the seventeenth century\xE2\x80\x94or as philosophy in general, for that matter. Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s off-hand remark that Spinoza is not a \xE2\x80\x9Cnormative thinker\xE2\x80\x9D and is \xE2\x80\x9Cdescriptive in intention all the way down\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 252) is astonishing in this regard (especially in light of much recent work on Spinoza). Moreover it is a missed opportunity for a discussion of the different senses of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe normative\xE2\x80\x9D in seventeenth century political philosophy, outside of the confines of the way we understand it today\xE2\x80\x94a way deeply shaped by Kant, it seems to me. This is not only a point about history. One thing the history of political thought can do is help loosen the grip of seeing our current way of using our normative concepts, as bequeathed to us by our intellectual heritage, as the only way. This is probably asking Harrison to do something that falls outside the bounds of his stated project, but I was led to think about it in the course of reading his book.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Thus, Samuel Pufendorf, in his <i>De officio hominis et civis</i>, conceived of man in the civil sphere as neither a self-obligating (and thus self-governing) rational being, nor as under obligation in virtue of some higher and divine moral force. Instead (as Ian Hunter and David Saunders have argued recently) he was attempting to reconstruct politics along the lines of a kind of \xE2\x80\x9Ccivic ethics\xE2\x80\x9D that could free the civil authorities of the territorial states in the new Westphalian world of Northern Europe from destabilizing disputes over what counts as the truly \xE2\x80\x9Chigher\xE2\x80\x9D authority. And he did so, in part, by applying the distinctive moral idiom of \xE2\x80\x9Coffice\xE2\x80\x9D to his analysis of the concept of duty in the civil sphere, something Harrison doesn\xE2\x80\x99t discuss and which is very different from moral theology or positive law (cf. 158-60) but still rooted very much in the context of seventeenth century arguments about politics. Second, and more generally, justification of belief was not the only way in which normative concerns were pursued in early modern philosophy. For example, the role of <i>ad hominem</i> argument and the \xE2\x80\x9Cexemplary\xE2\x80\x9D philosophical life (e.g. Bayle\xE2\x80\x99s portrayal of Spinoza), have no role in Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s story, despite their prominence in early modern arguments. Being open to these different ideas of the normative is important for grasping the absolute centrality in seventeenth century debates over the nature of history\xE2\x80\x94both sacred and profane\xE2\x80\x94which involve conceptions of knowledge that sit very uncomfortably with their modern counterparts. Hence debates over the interpretation of Scripture, and the messianic nature of some forms of Protestant theology (such as Locke\xE2\x80\x99s), shaped various normative political claims in ways at odds with the epistemological paradigm. In fact, Harrison is quite aware of the challenges this raises for the task of justification in politics (see especially pp. 186-8, 254, 255-7).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The book is replete with intelligent and very clear discussions of various problems familiar to readers of Hobbes and Locke. Harrison displays an excellent grasp of the wide range of texts that Hobbes and Locke wrote, as well as some of the surrounding texts to which they were responding and arguing with. He is also capable of putting various modern debates into helpful relief. Thus we get a careful discussion of the limits to which Hobbes\xE2\x80\x99s account of the state of nature represents a genuine version of the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s dilemma as modeled by contemporary game theorists, one that combines both conceptual analysis and careful attention to historical context (96-100, 113). The foundation of Locke\xE2\x80\x99s conception of natural rights is distinguished from the use Nozick makes of it (253-5). Harrison also makes an inspired use of Hobbes\xE2\x80\x99s distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Ccounsel\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ccommand\xE2\x80\x9D to help make sense of the ways the laws of nature are meant to oblige (pp. 81-92). There is an excellent discussion of the relation between will and consent in both Hobbes and Locke (126-129; 200-209). And there is a careful discussion of Locke\xE2\x80\x99s theory of property, which again asks the right kind of philosophical questions about the nature and incidents of property, but also with a view to the theological and practical contexts in which Locke\xE2\x80\x99s argument was embedded (219-238). Finally and more generally, as I\xE2\x80\x99ve already mentioned, Harrison is extremely sensitive to the kinds of question readers of these texts are prone to ask today: what would happen if we dropped God from the picture? What work does God, or at least various theological premises, do in these arguments? To what extent can we make sense of these arguments outside of these theological premises? For all these reasons and more, Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s book is a very welcome addition to the literature on seventeenth century political philosophy.</p>"

Second, and more generally, justification of belief was not the only way in which normative concerns were pursued in early modern philosophy. For example, the role of <i>ad hominem</i> argument and the \xE2\x80\x9Cexemplary\xE2\x80\x9D philosophical life (e.g. Bayle\xE2\x80\x99s portrayal of Spinoza), have no role in Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s story, despite their prominence in early modern arguments. Being open to these different ideas of the normative is important for grasping the absolute centrality in seventeenth century debates over the nature of history\xE2\x80\x94both sacred and profane\xE2\x80\x94which involve conceptions of knowledge that sit very uncomfortably with their modern counterparts. Hence debates over the interpretation of Scripture, and the messianic nature of some forms of Protestant theology (such as Locke\xE2\x80\x99s), shaped various normative political claims in ways at odds with the epistemological paradigm. In fact, Harrison is quite aware of the challenges this raises for the task of justification in politics (see especially pp. 186-8, 254, 255-7).</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The book is replete with intelligent and very clear discussions of various problems familiar to readers of Hobbes and Locke. Harrison displays an excellent grasp of the wide range of texts that Hobbes and Locke wrote, as well as some of the surrounding texts to which they were responding and arguing with. He is also capable of putting various modern debates into helpful relief. Thus we get a careful discussion of the limits to which Hobbes\xE2\x80\x99s account of the state of nature represents a genuine version of the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s dilemma as modeled by contemporary game theorists, one that combines both conceptual analysis and careful attention to historical context (96-100, 113). The foundation of Locke\xE2\x80\x99s conception of natural rights is distinguished from the use Nozick makes of it (253-5). Harrison also makes an inspired use of Hobbes\xE2\x80\x99s distinction between \xE2\x80\x9Ccounsel\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ccommand\xE2\x80\x9D to help make sense of the ways the laws of nature are meant to oblige (pp. 81-92). There is an excellent discussion of the relation between will and consent in both Hobbes and Locke (126-129; 200-209). And there is a careful discussion of Locke\xE2\x80\x99s theory of property, which again asks the right kind of philosophical questions about the nature and incidents of property, but also with a view to the theological and practical contexts in which Locke\xE2\x80\x99s argument was embedded (219-238). Finally and more generally, as I\xE2\x80\x99ve already mentioned, Harrison is extremely sensitive to the kinds of question readers of these texts are prone to ask today: what would happen if we dropped God from the picture? What work does God, or at least various theological premises, do in these arguments? To what extent can we make sense of these arguments outside of these theological premises? For all these reasons and more, Harrison\xE2\x80\x99s book is a very welcome addition to the literature on seventeenth century political philosophy.</p>"
