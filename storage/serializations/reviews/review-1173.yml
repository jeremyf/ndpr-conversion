content: "<p>Writing an ambitious biography that emphasizes Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s sexuality, K\xC3\xB6hler intends to show that Nietzsche was gay, and that this insight leads to a reinterpretation of his work. He claims that \xE2\x80\x9CNietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s intuitive philosophy cannot be understood apart from his profoundest experience of sexuality\xE2\x80\x9D (p xvii), and that a reconstruction of his hidden life leads to \xE2\x80\x9Ca radically different picture of his philosophy\xE2\x80\x9D (p xi). K\xC3\xB6hler assumes that \xE2\x80\x9Creceived views\xE2\x80\x9D of Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy depend on the assumption that he is \xE2\x80\x9Ca sexless intellectual with a walrus moustache\xE2\x80\x9D (p xii). In support of his claim that Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy should be interpreted in light of his sexual experiences, K\xC3\xB6hler quotes extensively from Nietzsche. Yet curiously, he does not address Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s exclamation, in <i>Ecce Homo</i>, that his writings are one thing, and he himself is another (section 1 of <i>Why I Write Such Good Books</i>). Be that as it may, K\xC3\xB6hler purports to discuss philosophy, and thus philosophers should take notice.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This book originally appeared in German in 1989, and the author decided to omit the second part of the original, a commentary on <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>. K\xC3\xB6hler explains that any reader who followed his account would have no further need for guidance. If that is true, however, one wonders why German-speaking readers of the original do still need such guidance. Much in the book indeed prepares the grounds for <i>Zarathustra</i>: for instance, K\xC3\xB6hler tells us repeatedly that <i>Zarathustra</i> draws on Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s nightmares and fantasies as a fatherless child raised first under the strict regiment of his mother, grandmother, and paternal aunts, and later in the rigorous prep school of Pforta. Since the <i>Zarathustra</i> commentary is missing, we only learn bits and pieces about how such references may illuminate that work. There is no extended discussion of any of Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s works, while the short remarks K\xC3\xB6hler offers are sometimes inaccurate. For instance, on p 213, K\xC3\xB6hler refers to the oppression of instincts depicted in the <i>Genealogy</i>, making it sound as if that passage gave an explanation for a given individual\xE2\x80\x99s feelings of guilt. Yet it does not, at least not quite the way K\xC3\xB6hler thinks; what Nietzsche explains there is something about the process of civilization that occurred in an early era and does lead to the bad conscience as we know it, but only mediated through other developments. Unfortunately, also, K\xC3\xB6hler quotes the Colli-Montinari edition by volume only, and does not always tell us which work he is quoting.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>So was Nietzsche gay? Personally, I have never cared much about Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s sexuality, and K\xC3\xB6hler has not convinced me that I should. But let us explore his case. K\xC3\xB6hler shows that the hypothesis that Nietzsche was gay illuminates many episodes in his life, and that some contemporaries thought that he was gay. What more could one expect? While it is presumably not true of the European 19th century what Peter Brown says (in his <i>The Body and Society</i>) of late antiquity, namely, that it is a world irretrievably closed to us, we must keep in mind that in some regards Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s was a different world indeed: the experience of diversity was limited; sexuality was not openly discussed, while homosexuality was often punishable by incarceration. (It did not just happen to Oscar Wilde in England.) Also, in Germany at least, a strong mentality of duty-bound service prevailed, not to the community, but to the emperor and to the <i>Obrigkeit</i>. Individual desires and ambitions were subject to an amount of social control alien to most of us. So it should be unsurprising that no direct evidence of Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s homosexuality emerges. Still, some skepticism remains: there is no specific person with whom K\xC3\xB6hler claims unambiguously that Nietzsche had a homosexual relationship, or with whom he longed to have one. No reference to a gay lover appears in Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s writings, not even in a note book, although Nietzsche, for most of his sane life, had little reason to suspect that, one day, scholars would eagerly publish even material he had discarded. There are no such references even from the days when he was losing his mind and his grip on propriety to such an extent that he drafted a letter to the emperor. During those days, however, Nietzsche still thought of Cosima Wagner.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The evidence, then, is exclusively indirect. Telling, for instance, is a conversation, in 1876, about a self-portrait of Hans Holbein\xE2\x80\x99s, of which Nietzsche said it displayed \xE2\x80\x9Clips made for kissing\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94an observation that may not jump to a straight man\xE2\x80\x99s mind. Less telling, for instance, is the episode of Nietzsche asking his student von Scheffler to join him for a vacation. Inappropriate as this presumably was, it is no indication of homosexuality, given that the competing hypothesis is that Nietzsche was a sensitive if perhaps socially somewhat maladjusted (but at any rate straight) man trying to connect to like-minded souls wherever he could reach them, and was often rebuked in that process. The famous episode of Wagner contacting Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s physician appears as well: Wagner sent word to the doctor to inform him that excessive masturbation was responsible for Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s health problems. K\xC3\xB6hler interprets Wagner as lamenting about Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s lack of intercourse with women. K\xC3\xB6hler displays particular ingenuity by exploring yet another episode, which has puzzled Nietzsche biographers: In a letter to Nietzsche on his 33rd birthday, Paul R\xC3\xA9e reminded him of an earlier joint stay in the village Bex, insisting that stay amounted to a picture of perfection \xE2\x80\x9Ceven if Stella had not been there.\xE2\x80\x9D So who is \xE2\x80\x9CStella\xE2\x80\x9D? Offering his own answer, K\xC3\xB6hler refers to a passage in H\xC3\xB6lderlin\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Hyperion</i> where the hero asks: \xE2\x80\x9CDo you know how Plato loved his Stella\xE2\x80\x9D? Stella, the Latin word for star, was a male character. Does K\xC3\xB6hler mean to suggest that R\xC3\xA9e and Nietzsche were gay lovers, at least briefly? Presumably, and then he goes on to say that it was R\xC3\xA9e\xE2\x80\x99s Jewish nose that turned Nietzsche off. This is as close as K\xC3\xB6hler comes to actually connecting Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s alleged homosexuality to a particular person.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Very illuminating is K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s suggestion that Nietzsche went to Italy because it offered refuge to German homosexuals exiled from their own country. Long before Thomas Mann\xE2\x80\x99s Aschenbach encountered the boy Tadzio, German homosexuals ventured south to find their own Tadzios. K\xC3\xB6hler focuses on Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s journey to Sicily in 1882, from which he seems to have emerged unusually well relaxed. We know nothing about what Nietzsche did in Sicily, but K\xC3\xB6hler argues that he could not possibly have gone for any other reason than to seek homosexual encounters. (K\xC3\xB6hler includes photographs of Sicilian adonises taken by a German photographer who had made a permanent transition from the cold, Protestant North of Germany to the allegedly sexually liberated South of Italy. What happened to the supervision of the Catholic Church down there?) K\xC3\xB6hler writes as if that trip had been the culmination of Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s homosexual life, whatever else that life amounted to.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Given this background, K\xC3\xB6hler approaches Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s failed proposal to Lou Salom\xC3\xA9. Joining R\xC3\xA9e and Salom\xC3\xA9 in Rome after returning from Sicily, Nietzsche was now seriously concerned about his reputation, says K\xC3\xB6hler. \xE2\x80\x9CIn Lou he found a soul who legitimized, stimulated and entertained him and who was desperately anxious to conceal that side of the female psyche which repelled him. She was not interested in sexual love\xE2\x80\x9D (p 205). The ideal match for Nietzsche, apparently, but Lou was not even interested in a sexless marriage with Nietzsche (useful to both of them to cover up what was deviant sexuality by the social standards of the time), though that is precisely what Friedrich Carl Andreas got later. So far from epitomizing Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s failure with women, Lou was appealing to him because she was, as Rilke put it, a \xE2\x80\x9Cfemale youth.\xE2\x80\x9D Once again, skepticism remains: if Nietzsche did not love her, why did this episode cause such agony? The origin of Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s syphilis, by the way, according to K\xC3\xB6hler, is to be found in a visit to a male brothel in Genoa, rather than a female brothel in Cologne.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Still, while there are lingering questions and no conclusive evidence, K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s case is strong: he makes it a very real possibility that Nietzsche was gay. Yet granting that much, or more, for the sake of the argument, why should we care whether Nietzsche was gay if we are interested in his philosophy? After all, we do not <i>have</i> to consult Rousseau\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Confessions</i> to learn about the social contract, though Rousseau reveals (in disgusting detail) precisely the kind of information that K\xC3\xB6hler painstakingly reconstructs about Nietzsche. The best reason why we should care is K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s claim that his approach throws light on <i>Zarathustra,</i> but, again, he omitted the part in which he would make good on that claim. As it is, the climax of K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s book is chapter 12, like the book itself called \xE2\x80\x9CZarathustra\xE2\x80\x99s Secret.\xE2\x80\x9D That chapter, however, is unsatisfactory.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The core of chapter 12 is K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s reflection on Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s revelation-like experience in August 1881, when the thought of the eternal recurrence came to him. K\xC3\xB6hler asks: \xE2\x80\x9CWhatever happened to Nietzsche by the lakeside on that August day in 1881 \xE2\x80\x93 why was he convinced that his vision had objective validity?\xE2\x80\x9D (p 233). He continues:</p>  \t\t <blockquote>The answer is quite simple: it was not the recurrence as depicted on the shield that persuaded him but the recurrence of the shield itself. It had penetrated his consciousness long ago but he saw it as though for the first time. It seemed to be not an image preserved in his memory but a vision both unique and familiar from time immemorial. Something that had been forgotten for ages past but that now, like a flash of lightning, reappeared, recognizable down to the last detail (p 234).</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This \xE2\x80\x9Cshield\xE2\x80\x9D is the \xE2\x80\x9Cshield of necessity, the tablet of eternal things\xE2\x80\x9D (p 232), the shield of Achilles, as Homer describes it in the <i>Iliad</i>. That shield, for Nietzsche, symbolized his Greek ideal at the purest. \xE2\x80\x9CStanding on the shore of the lake at Silvaplana . . . he suddenly found himself confronted by a vision of perfection, his beloved Arcadia.\xE2\x80\x9D From there K\xC3\xB6hler continues to explain that the reoccurrence of that vision (both on that shield and in Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s vision when standing on that lakeshore) persuaded Nietzsche of the \xE2\x80\x9Cobjective validity\xE2\x80\x9D of eternal recurrence.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I can offer no alternative account of what happened on that day in Silvaplana, but I hope it was not what K\xC3\xB6hler claims it was. For if Nietzsche jumped to conclusions about the \xE2\x80\x9Cobjective validity\xE2\x80\x9D of the idea of eternal recurrence, which at any rate is about the repeated occurrence of <i>everything</i>, from the repeated appearance <i>in his life</i> of images that reminded him of classical Greece, his powers of inference would have been seriously impeded already in 1881. Fortunately, we have no reason to believe that this was so. K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s reconstruction is the product of wildly implausible speculation. In a different approach K\xC3\xB6hler traces the origin of eternal recurrence to H\xC3\xB6lderlin\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Hyperion</i>. The character Diotima (borrowed in turn from Plato\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Symposium</i>) says there: \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is everything that men have thought and done over the centuries compared with just one moment of love?\xE2\x80\x9D (p 239). While there is a connection to Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s idea of eternal recurrence, K\xC3\xB6hler seems to overreach by suggesting that this idea \xE2\x80\x9Cgrew out of\xE2\x80\x9D H\xC3\xB6lderlin\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysics of friendship\xE2\x80\x9D (p 239). Philosophers have asked different questions about eternal recurrence: is this most plausibly understood as a cosmological thesis, or a decision test, or an affirmation test, or something yet different? Can it replace the Categorical Imperative, the Ten Commandments, and the utilitarian calculus? While K\xC3\xB6hler is not required to address these questions, his suggestions even fail to make eternal recurrence interesting. We never even learn just what K\xC3\xB6hler thinks eternal recurrence <i>is</i>. He sometimes talks as if it had something to do with the return of an individual\xE2\x80\x99s own past, but it is certain that that is not what it is.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Chapter 12 also deals with Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s announcement of the death of God, which K\xC3\xB6hler interprets in light of the death of Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s father. Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s deepest problem, throughout his life, was to come to terms with that death, says K\xC3\xB6hler, and he never outgrew the nightmares triggered by this event. The language of the death of God finally enabled him to diagnose his condition\xE2\x80\x94and the therapy was to endorse the eternal recurrence and the value of friendship allegedly captured therein. Yet at this stage, K\xC3\xB6hler abandons philosophy altogether. While it is one thing to argue that ideas articulated only decades later resonate with a philosopher\xE2\x80\x99s childhood experiences, it is quite another to write as if there were nothing more to them. What is philosophically interesting about Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s announcement of the death of God is whether there is anything left to do for moral philosophy in the absence of the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent deity of Christianity. Are Kantian ethics and utilitarianism, most prominently, only pale imitations of fragments of moral thought that are ultimately bound to collapse if the notion of God is discarded for justificatory purposes? Once again, K\xC3\xB6hler is not required to address such questions, but he reduces Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s writings to mere autobiography if he thinks the death of Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s father is all there is to his reflections on the death of God.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This, then, is Zarathustra\xE2\x80\x99s secret: Zarathustra, Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cson,\xE2\x80\x9D talks in cryptic terms about Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s life itself, his experiences as a fatherless son, and his subsequent experiences as a homosexual condemned to hiding his inclinations. It is also Zarathustra who suggests the therapy: the pure ecstasy of friendship. Yet in addition to the concern articulated in the last paragraph, we are now also wondering what the connection is between Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s alleged homosexuality, which seems to be part of what Zarathustra reveals, properly understood, and the eternal recurrence, or the superman (whom K\xC3\xB6hler brings a bit too much in connection with Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s Sicilian encounters, saying that Nietzsche \xE2\x80\x9Csaw\xE2\x80\x9D the superman in Sicily (p 255)). K\xC3\xB6hler insists that Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy must be rethought once we come to terms with his homosexuality, but fails to explain why Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s homosexuality even informs his idea of eternal recurrence. Just how do philosophers have to modify their thinking about eternal recurrence if that idea is proposed by a gay man with nightmares and fantasies, rather than a \xE2\x80\x9Csexless intellectual with a walrus moustache?\xE2\x80\x9D Would we have to rethink the Categorical Imperative if new research revealed that Kant and Lampe were gay lovers? It might well be possible that Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s hidden homosexuality helps explain passages in <i>Zarathustra</i>; if so, it is so much more unfortunate that the <i>Zarathustra</i> commentary was excluded from the translation. For at least this reader is incapable of applying K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s insights rewardingly to Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s most notorious work without further assistance. But at any rate, the connection between Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s hidden homosexuality and central themes, such as the death of God and eternal recurrence, remains obscure. Thus we still do not know why we should care about Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s sexuality. This remains K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s secret, and he guards it well.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Such dissatisfaction with K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s book, I believe, is not motivated by philosophical esotericism. Surely, authors like Nietzsche must be kept accessible to the educated public, and no harm is done if such popularization sacrifices philosophical depth. Yet the doubts we have raised are not primarily philosophical doubts. They are doubts that arise just by asking straightforward questions about what K\xC3\xB6hler is up to. K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s book makes for a great read because it is fascinating and thought-provoking for what it is: a well-written biography about Nietzsche emphasizing his sexuality. But it does not force us to reconsider what matters about his philosophy.</p>"

As it is, the climax of K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s book is chapter 12, like the book itself called \xE2\x80\x9CZarathustra\xE2\x80\x99s Secret.\xE2\x80\x9D That chapter, however, is unsatisfactory.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>The core of chapter 12 is K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s reflection on Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s revelation-like experience in August 1881, when the thought of the eternal recurrence came to him. K\xC3\xB6hler asks: \xE2\x80\x9CWhatever happened to Nietzsche by the lakeside on that August day in 1881 \xE2\x80\x93 why was he convinced that his vision had objective validity?\xE2\x80\x9D (p 233). He continues:</p>  \t\t <blockquote>The answer is quite simple: it was not the recurrence as depicted on the shield that persuaded him but the recurrence of the shield itself. It had penetrated his consciousness long ago but he saw it as though for the first time. It seemed to be not an image preserved in his memory but a vision both unique and familiar from time immemorial. Something that had been forgotten for ages past but that now, like a flash of lightning, reappeared, recognizable down to the last detail (p 234).</blockquote>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This \xE2\x80\x9Cshield\xE2\x80\x9D is the \xE2\x80\x9Cshield of necessity, the tablet of eternal things\xE2\x80\x9D (p 232), the shield of Achilles, as Homer describes it in the <i>Iliad</i>. That shield, for Nietzsche, symbolized his Greek ideal at the purest. \xE2\x80\x9CStanding on the shore of the lake at Silvaplana . . . he suddenly found himself confronted by a vision of perfection, his beloved Arcadia.\xE2\x80\x9D From there K\xC3\xB6hler continues to explain that the reoccurrence of that vision (both on that shield and in Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s vision when standing on that lakeshore) persuaded Nietzsche of the \xE2\x80\x9Cobjective validity\xE2\x80\x9D of eternal recurrence.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>I can offer no alternative account of what happened on that day in Silvaplana, but I hope it was not what K\xC3\xB6hler claims it was. For if Nietzsche jumped to conclusions about the \xE2\x80\x9Cobjective validity\xE2\x80\x9D of the idea of eternal recurrence, which at any rate is about the repeated occurrence of <i>everything</i>, from the repeated appearance <i>in his life</i> of images that reminded him of classical Greece, his powers of inference would have been seriously impeded already in 1881. Fortunately, we have no reason to believe that this was so. K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s reconstruction is the product of wildly implausible speculation. In a different approach K\xC3\xB6hler traces the origin of eternal recurrence to H\xC3\xB6lderlin\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Hyperion</i>. The character Diotima (borrowed in turn from Plato\xE2\x80\x99s <i>Symposium</i>) says there: \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is everything that men have thought and done over the centuries compared with just one moment of love?\xE2\x80\x9D (p 239). While there is a connection to Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s idea of eternal recurrence, K\xC3\xB6hler seems to overreach by suggesting that this idea \xE2\x80\x9Cgrew out of\xE2\x80\x9D H\xC3\xB6lderlin\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cmetaphysics of friendship\xE2\x80\x9D (p 239). Philosophers have asked different questions about eternal recurrence: is this most plausibly understood as a cosmological thesis, or a decision test, or an affirmation test, or something yet different? Can it replace the Categorical Imperative, the Ten Commandments, and the utilitarian calculus? While K\xC3\xB6hler is not required to address these questions, his suggestions even fail to make eternal recurrence interesting. We never even learn just what K\xC3\xB6hler thinks eternal recurrence <i>is</i>. He sometimes talks as if it had something to do with the return of an individual\xE2\x80\x99s own past, but it is certain that that is not what it is.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Chapter 12 also deals with Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s announcement of the death of God, which K\xC3\xB6hler interprets in light of the death of Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s father. Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s deepest problem, throughout his life, was to come to terms with that death, says K\xC3\xB6hler, and he never outgrew the nightmares triggered by this event. The language of the death of God finally enabled him to diagnose his condition\xE2\x80\x94and the therapy was to endorse the eternal recurrence and the value of friendship allegedly captured therein. Yet at this stage, K\xC3\xB6hler abandons philosophy altogether. While it is one thing to argue that ideas articulated only decades later resonate with a philosopher\xE2\x80\x99s childhood experiences, it is quite another to write as if there were nothing more to them. What is philosophically interesting about Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s announcement of the death of God is whether there is anything left to do for moral philosophy in the absence of the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent deity of Christianity. Are Kantian ethics and utilitarianism, most prominently, only pale imitations of fragments of moral thought that are ultimately bound to collapse if the notion of God is discarded for justificatory purposes? Once again, K\xC3\xB6hler is not required to address such questions, but he reduces Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s writings to mere autobiography if he thinks the death of Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s father is all there is to his reflections on the death of God.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>This, then, is Zarathustra\xE2\x80\x99s secret: Zarathustra, Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cson,\xE2\x80\x9D talks in cryptic terms about Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s life itself, his experiences as a fatherless son, and his subsequent experiences as a homosexual condemned to hiding his inclinations. It is also Zarathustra who suggests the therapy: the pure ecstasy of friendship. Yet in addition to the concern articulated in the last paragraph, we are now also wondering what the connection is between Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s alleged homosexuality, which seems to be part of what Zarathustra reveals, properly understood, and the eternal recurrence, or the superman (whom K\xC3\xB6hler brings a bit too much in connection with Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s Sicilian encounters, saying that Nietzsche \xE2\x80\x9Csaw\xE2\x80\x9D the superman in Sicily (p 255)). K\xC3\xB6hler insists that Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy must be rethought once we come to terms with his homosexuality, but fails to explain why Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s homosexuality even informs his idea of eternal recurrence. Just how do philosophers have to modify their thinking about eternal recurrence if that idea is proposed by a gay man with nightmares and fantasies, rather than a \xE2\x80\x9Csexless intellectual with a walrus moustache?\xE2\x80\x9D Would we have to rethink the Categorical Imperative if new research revealed that Kant and Lampe were gay lovers? It might well be possible that Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s hidden homosexuality helps explain passages in <i>Zarathustra</i>; if so, it is so much more unfortunate that the <i>Zarathustra</i> commentary was excluded from the translation. For at least this reader is incapable of applying K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s insights rewardingly to Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s most notorious work without further assistance. But at any rate, the connection between Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s hidden homosexuality and central themes, such as the death of God and eternal recurrence, remains obscure. Thus we still do not know why we should care about Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s sexuality. This remains K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s secret, and he guards it well.</p>  \t\t \n\
  <p>Such dissatisfaction with K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s book, I believe, is not motivated by philosophical esotericism. Surely, authors like Nietzsche must be kept accessible to the educated public, and no harm is done if such popularization sacrifices philosophical depth. Yet the doubts we have raised are not primarily philosophical doubts. They are doubts that arise just by asking straightforward questions about what K\xC3\xB6hler is up to. K\xC3\xB6hler\xE2\x80\x99s book makes for a great read because it is fascinating and thought-provoking for what it is: a well-written biography about Nietzsche emphasizing his sexuality. But it does not force us to reconsider what matters about his philosophy.</p>"
