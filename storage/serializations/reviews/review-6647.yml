content: "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\">Thirty-four years after its first publication, an important work of scholarship has been re-released.<span style=\"\">  </span>With this book, Bimal Matilal established the ambitious agenda which he would pursue in his later works, including his masterpiece, <i>Perception</i></span><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\"> (Clarendon Press, 1986).<span style=\"\">  </span>Matilal sought not merely to make a contribution to intercultural understanding, but also to effect a change in the culture of American academic philosophy that would bring Indian philosophers into the mainstream of philosophical debate.<span style=\"\">  </span>That Matilal had even partial success in this endeavor is a testimony to the value of his scholarship.<span style=\"\">  </span>That his success was only partial was due much more to the difficulty of the task than to the minor defects in his work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>     <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\"> <o:p></o:p>\r\n\
  </span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\">Before Matilal, the study of Indian thought was dominated by two very different kinds of scholars: students of philology with no interest in the great questions of life, and enthusiasts of mysticism with no interest in rigor, precision or clarity.<span style=\"\">  </span>These scholars had a tendency to represent the teachings of Indian thinkers either as emerging through an entirely non-rational process from primordial Indian mythology, or else as the direct expression of a non-conceptual, mystical direct awareness.<span style=\"\">  </span>Matilal, on the other hand, showed that at least some Indian writers can more profitably be understood as arriving at their conclusions through various forms of careful reasoning, all of which have parallels (though not necessarily close parallels) in Western philosophy.<span style=\"\">  </span>These styles of reasoning are quite varied, and include regress objections, <i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\"> arguments, and the critical deployment of the sophisticated classification of fallacies developed by Indian epistemologists.<span style=\"\">  </span>As Matilal claimed, the presence of highly developed, carefully stated arguments in the writings of a number of Indian thinkers establishes that they are philosophers in the most precise and restrictive sense of that term.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\">Matilal was not the very first writer to make this point.<span style=\"\">  </span>For example, D. N. Shastri\xE2\x80\x99s excellent <i>Critique of Indian Realism</i></span><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\"> preceded Matilal\xE2\x80\x99s major works by several years.<span style=\"\">  </span>But Matilal developed the case for the genuinely philosophical status of Indian thought in a more comprehensive way than had ever been attempted before.<span style=\"\">  </span>His qualifications for this task included an unquestioned proficiency in philosophical Sanskrit, an impressively broad knowledge of the Indian philosophical literature, and a thorough familiarity with several of the major philosophers in the analytic tradition, such as Frege, Russell, and Quine.<span style=\"\">  </span>As a result, Matilal was able to see connections between Indian and Western philosophical debates that have since become major topics in the scholarly literature.<span style=\"\">  </span>Juxtaposing the Ny</span>\xC4\x81<span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\">ya doctrine

about perception with analogous Western discussions of the conceptual or nonconceptual nature of perception (in sections 1.5, 2.1 and 2.8, for example), were only some of Matilal\xE2\x80\x99s important contributions.<span style=\"\">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Times_Norman;\">Anyone who has been following recent work on Indian philosophy knows that Matilal\xE2\x80\x99s agenda is being taken up by an increasing number of scholars.<span

</span>To this extent, Matilal\xE2\x80\x99s project was a success: he transformed the way specialists understand Indian thought.<span style=\"\">  </span>But Matilal also wished to bring Indian philosophy into the mainstream of the Western philosophical conversation, and to convince analytic philosophers generally that the Indian tradition was worthy of their attention.<span style=\"\">  </span>In this, of course, neither this book nor any subsequent one has been very strikingly successful; most analytic philosophers continue to ignore Indian texts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p

expression can ever fail to refer, turns out to have much more that can be said for it than one might think.<span style=\"\">  </span>Though in most of the chapter Matilal faithfully reports the
