content: "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil\xE2\x80\x99s main positive thesis is that fundamental issues in the philosophy of mind can be best addressed by adopting an adequate ontology and a correct account of dispositions or causal powers. These fundamental issues include the nature of experience and consciousness. Heil motivates his arguments in terms of two leading ideas. The first of these is that <i>ontology is inescapable</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and that contemporary philosophy of mind has been hampered due to an over-reliance on linguistic approaches that are insufficiently ontological. Heil makes a compelling case that progress in the philosophy of mind requires ontological seriousness. The second idea concerns the manifest incorrectness and negative influence of the </span><i>Picture Theory of representation</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, roughly, the theory \xE2\x80\x9Cthat the character of reality can be \xE2\x80\x98read off\xE2\x80\x99 our linguistic representations of reality\xE2\x80\x9D, and accordingly, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat to every meaningful predicate there corresponds a property\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 6). Heil believes that although few philosophers today explicitly endorse the Picture Theory, its influence is widespread in ontology and the philosophy of mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil\xE2\x80\x99s book is masterful, wide-ranging, and instructive. It is also tightly argued, insightful, and provocative. The book is written in an admirably clear analytic style and is extremely well organized (each of the twenty concise chapters is subdivided into short numbered sections). Another plus is that Heil relates his ideas to those of major historical figures, e.g., Plato, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, and discusses as well the ideas of a full range of major contemporary philosophers, including D. M. Armstrong, David Chalmers, Donald Davidson, Frank Jackson Jaegwon Kim, Saul Kripke , E. J. Lowe, C. B. Martin, Colin McGinn, Hilary Putnam, and Sidney Shoemaker. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in ontology or the philosophy of mind.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil\xE2\x80\x99s critique of the Picture Theory commits him to skepticism about <i>hierarchies</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> </span><i>of properties</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of various sorts, for instance, hierarchies of </span><i>higher-order</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> properties, that is to say, properties of properties. Thus, for example, on the assumption that there are properties, Heil doubts that there is the higher-order property </span><i>being a property</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Yet, suppose we take ontology seriously, as Heil urges us to do. In that case, on the assumption that properties are real beings, the property, </span><i>being a property</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, qualifies as an ontological category, that is, as one of the more basic divisions of real beings, a division that figures in a </span><i>hierarchy of ontological categories</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. In such a hierarchy, </span><i>being a property</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is subsumed by a more general, or more basic, higher-order property, for example, </span><i>being an abstract entity</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, or alternatively, </span><i>being a concrete entity</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. (Other candidates for such a higher-order property are </span><i>being a universal</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, </span><i>being a particular</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, </span><i>necessarily existing</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> </span><i>being</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and </span><i>contingently existing being.</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) The degree to which an </span><i>ontological</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> </span><i>category</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is </span><i>general</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is directly proportional to the degree to which it is </span><i>basic</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. For these reasons, I believe that there is a significant unresolved tension between Heil\xE2\x80\x99s two leading ideas. Heil could have eased this tension by limiting his skepticism to hierarchies consisting of properties that are </span><i>more specific</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> than ontological categories. After all, Heil seems to be primarily concerned with these more specific properties, for example, painfulness, fragility, and redness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil\xE2\x80\x99s ontology, influenced by C. B. Martin, posits <i>substances</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and </span><i>modes</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Substances (or </span><i>objects</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) are entities in which modes inhere; modes (also known as </span><i>tropes</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) are particularized ways objects are. Substances are basic entities; they are not bundles of modes. Primitive relationships of </span><i>perfect resemblance</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and </span><i>imperfect resemblance</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> hold among modes. E.g., two particular sphericities perfectly resemble one another, whereas a particular scarlet and a particular magenta resemble one another only imperfectly. Heil criticizes and rejects Aristotelian and Platonic theories of universals, arguing that objects </span><i>share a property</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> if and only if perfectly resembling </span><i>modes</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> inhere in those objects. Finally, according to Heil\xE2\x80\x99s </span><i>identity theory</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of dispositions, the </span><i>qualities</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of objects, e.g., sphericity, are </span><i>identical with</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> dispositions of those objects, for example, the power to roll, to leave a spherical impression in mud, etc. (Thus, natural laws are necessary, but the qualities that figure in natural laws have contingent existence.) According to this identity theory, the qualities and powers of objects are ontologically on a par.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil argues that his ontology undermines the belief in a <i>hierarchy of</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> </span><i>levels of reality</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> advocated by many contemporary anti-reductionist philosophers of mind. Thus, e.g., Heil rejects the notion that </span><i>pain</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is a </span><i>higher-level</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> property, i.e., a property that is </span><i>multiply realizable</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> in physiologically dissimilar creatures such as humans, fishes, and extraterrestrials (and not to be confused with a </span><i>higher-order</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> property). This notion, encouraged by the Picture Theory, gives rise to seemingly intractable philosophical problems about the inter-level relations and causal status of pains. These problems do not arise if physiologically dissimilar creatures could not be in pain in virtue of </span><i>sharing</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> some property, but rather, could only be in pain in virtue of having </span><i>imperfectly similar qualities</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Heil draws a parallel conclusion about dispositions; micro-structurally dissimilar fragile objects, say, wine glasses and clay vases, do not share a higher-level multiply realizable property of fragility, instead, their fragilities are imperfectly similar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil\xE2\x80\x99s ontology grounds his strong defense of the <i>token-token</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> identity theory that every mental quality (or </span><i>mode</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) of an object is identical with a neurological quality of that object. In Heil\xE2\x80\x99s view, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe can accept levels of organization, levels of complexity, levels of description, and levels of explanation, without commitment to levels of reality in the sense embraced by many self-proclaimed anti-reductionist philosophers today. The upshot is a conception of the world that is ontologically, but not analytically, reductive\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 10).<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil builds a powerful case for his central claims. Still, I have questions about some important matters of detail. I now turn to these details.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Truth.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Given his critique of the Picture Theory, Heil doubts that abstract propositions are \xE2\x80\x9Cintermediaries standing between the world and statements or assertions about the world\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 9). Yet, as he acknowledges, it is difficult to believe that for every way the world is, there is a <i>concrete representation</i></span> of its being that way (pp. 55, 72). Intuitively, though, for every way the world is, it is <i>true</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that it is that way. E.g., it seems that if, at a time, </span><i>t</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, three billion years ago, nothing concretely represents the Earth as existing, because, at </span><i>t</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, there is no life on Earth, then, at </span><i>t</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, it is nonetheless </span><i>true</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that the Earth exists at </span><i>t</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. So, it seems that for every way the world is, there is an </span><i>abstract representation</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, that is to say, a </span><i>proposition</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, about its being that way. Heil challenges the proponents of propositions as truth-bearers to provide an account of the relation between propositions and truth-makers (p. 73). Since there is no apparent difference between a </span><i>true proposition</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and an </span><i>obtaining state of affairs</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, truth seems not to be a matter of a proposition\xE2\x80\x99s </span><i>corresponding</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to an obtaining state of affairs. I\xE2\x80\x99m inclined to respond that propositions are true in virtue of their correspondence to </span><i>existing states</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, where a </span><i>state</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is understood as </span><i>an entity\xE2\x80\x99s having an attribute</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Thus, a proposition, </span><i>p</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, is true just when there is an entity, </span><i>e</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and a state, </span><i>s</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, such that: </span><i>s</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is identical with </span><i>e</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\xE2\x80\x99s having the attribute of being such that </span><i>p</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. E.g., the proposition </span><i>that Fido chases Morris</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is </span><i>true</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, just when there exists a </span><i>state</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of </span><i>Fido</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> identical with </span><i>Fido\xE2\x80\x99s having the attribute of being such that Fido chases Morris</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Since there </span><i>is</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> a clear distinction between truth and </span><i>existence</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and since, while propositions are </span><i>abstract</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, states of </span><i>concreta</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> are concrete, a </span><i>true proposition</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and an </span><i>existing state</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> seem to be different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Transcendent Universals.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> Heil finds it very odd that we could arrive at the existence of sharable Platonic properties \xE2\x80\x9Csolely on the basis of philosophical theorizing\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 149). The Platonic realist may plausibly respond that this isn\xE2\x80\x99t so odd because, even so, these transcendent universals are hypothesized on the ground that they figure in the best explanation of <i>highly general</i></span> <i>facts</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> about what we </span><i>experience</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Undetachable Spatial Parts.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> Heil defends a peculiar notion of the \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D of a compound object like a book (p. 174). Heil claims that such a \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D is an <i>undetachable spatial part</i></span> of a compound object, unlike <i>the portion of matter</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that coincides with this \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D, which he takes to be a detachable part of the compound object in question. Yet, as Heil admits, the \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D and the \xE2\x80\x9Cbottom half\xE2\x80\x9D of a compound object do not </span><i>make up</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that object (p. 100). But, surely, if so, then the \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D and the \xE2\x80\x9Cbottom half\xE2\x80\x9D could not be </span><i>parts</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of such an object. The notion that the \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cbottom half\xE2\x80\x9D of a compound object are undetachable parts of that object seems to confuse parts of </span><i>space</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> with parts of an </span><i>object</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that </span><i>occupies</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> space.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Higher-Order Properties.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> \xE2\x80\x9CAn apparent difficulty with appeals to higher-order properties to account for property similarities is that second-order properties themselves bear similarity relations to one another: scarlet and crimson are similar in being red; red, blue, and orange are similar in being colors; and colours, shapes, and textures are similar in being properties. If we invoke higher-order properties to account for these similarities, we shall need a hierarchy of higher-order properties, and this looks like the start of an unhappy regress. Worse, perhaps, as we ascend the hierarchy, we move further away from our original conception of similarity. Shapes, colours, and textures are all properties, but are they thereby similar?\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 155). However, since there must be a <i>single</i></span> <i>summum genus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> at the apex of such a hierarchy of higher-order properties, it is hard to understand why Heil is concerned about the possibility of a regress. Continuing on the upward path where Heil leaves off, properties, relations, and propositions are all </span><i>abstracta</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and </span><i>abstracta</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and </span><i>concreta</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> are all entities. </span><i>Being an entity</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is a limiting case of an ontological category. Since </span><i>being an entity</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is the </span><i>summum genus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, the regress stops there. Whether or not this </span><i>summum genus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> counts as a property, it will be a brute fact </span><i>that all entities are similar in being entities</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. But it seems harmless that this is a brute fact. Finally, why think that as we ascend the hierarchy we are moving away from our original conception of similarity, as opposed to our considering items that are similar in increasingly abstract ways?<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Colors.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Heil defends a Lockean account of colors. Colors are dispositions of things to cause sensations of color in us; things have these dispositions in virtue of their micro-structural qualities. An account of this kind has the highly plausible consequence that our sensations of color do not <i>resemble</i></span> the things that cause them. Yet, such an account conflicts with an intuitive na\xC3\xAFve conception of colors as a distinctive class of visually perceivable qualities of things. I wonder whether Heil takes this conflict seriously enough. If one believes that this conflict provides a decisive objection to a dispositional account of color, then one may well conclude that our everyday attributions of colors to objects are <i>false</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and that only sensations or the like are really colored.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s Razor.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> \xE2\x80\x9CEven if simplicity is limited to numbers of entities posited, this surely must be understood as pertaining, not to the number of particular entities, but to the number of <i>kinds</i></span> of entity. You do not simplify physics by cutting down on the number of electrons\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 147). However, the considerations adduced by Copernicus in favor of his heliocentric theory seem to provide a historically prominent counterexample to these claims. Copernicus cogently argued that because his heliocentric theory needed <i>far fewer epicycles</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> than the prevailing geocentric theory, his theory was superior (</span><i>even though epicycles were still needed</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Primitive Similarites.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> Heil\xE2\x80\x99s modes stand in primitive relations of perfect similarity and imperfect similarity. Since Heil rejects universals, he seems to be committed to the existence of relations in the sense of <i>particularized</i></span> ways in which things are related. Because there appear to be indefinitely many particular ways in which things are perfectly or imperfectly similar, it seems that Heil\xE2\x80\x99s ontology requires <i>indefinitely many</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> primitive relations. Yet, primitive relations should not be multiplied unnecessarily. These considerations raise questions about whether Heil\xE2\x80\x99s ontology of modes is as theoretically advantageous as it might appear to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Substances.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> \xE2\x80\x9CA commitment to an ontology of objects, however, is not a commitment to material corpuscles. What the fundamental objects are is anybody\xE2\x80\x99s guess. The answer is not something to be had a priori, but only by appeal to empirical theories advanced in basic physics. We need not imagine that the fundamental objects are particle-like. Objects could be fields. Perhaps there is but a single object: space, or space-time, or some all-embracing quantum field\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 177). Heil\xE2\x80\x99s claim that space-time or the like could be a <i>substance</i></span> is unintuitive. Indeed, it seems possible that the universe is best understood in terms of space-time and an <i>event ontology</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. This seems to imply that space-time is necessarily </span><i>insubstantial</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Moreover, Heil\xE2\x80\x99s characterization of a substance as . </span><i>possessor of properties not itself a property</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (p. 179) does not seem to lend theoretical support to his claim, since it seems that non-substantial entities other than properties possess properties, e.g., events, collections, and boundaries. Thus, Heil\xE2\x80\x99s characterization of substance seems not to provide a sufficient condition for substantiality. So, it is far from clear that if space-time is a possessor of properties not itself a property, then space-time is a substance. For these reasons, I do not find it plausible that space-time or the like could be a substance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   According to Heil, our belief that ordinary items like lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people are <i>substances</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> could turn out to be false. For example, such items could turn out to be </span><i>qualities</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> [of regions of space-time]. Heil also defends the thesis that if this belief were to turn out to be false, then it would nonetheless be </span><i>true</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that </span><i>there are</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people. Heil defends this thesis by arguing that our </span><i>concepts</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of such items are </span><i>not</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> concepts of </span><i>substances</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, but rather, are concepts of items that possess certain properties or stand in certain relations, although our tacit acceptance of the Picture Theory could well lead us to mistakenly think otherwise. I find this defense unconvincing because </span><i>prima facie</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> it is a </span><i>category mistake</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to characterize ordinary items like lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people as </span><i>insubstantial</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, e.g., as </span><i>qualities</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. If characterizing such items as insubstantial </span><i>is</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> a category mistake, then our </span><i>concepts</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of items of this kind </span><i>are</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> concepts of </span><i>substances</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and such items could </span><i>not</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> turn out to be insubstantial. In that case, if our belief that there are </span><i>substantial</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people were to turn out to be false, then it would </span><i>not</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> be true that </span><i>there are</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people.</span>"

According to this identity theory, the qualities and powers of objects are ontologically on a par.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil argues that his ontology undermines the belief in a <i>hierarchy of</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> </span><i>levels of reality</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> advocated by many contemporary anti-reductionist philosophers of mind. Thus, e.g., Heil rejects the notion that </span><i>pain</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is a </span><i>higher-level</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> property, i.e., a property that is </span><i>multiply realizable</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> in physiologically dissimilar creatures such as humans, fishes, and extraterrestrials (and not to be confused with a </span><i>higher-order</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> property). This notion, encouraged by the Picture Theory, gives rise to seemingly intractable philosophical problems about the inter-level relations and causal status of pains. These problems do not arise if physiologically dissimilar creatures could not be in pain in virtue of </span><i>sharing</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> some property, but rather, could only be in pain in virtue of having </span><i>imperfectly similar qualities</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Heil draws a parallel conclusion about dispositions; micro-structurally dissimilar fragile objects, say, wine glasses and clay vases, do not share a higher-level multiply realizable property of fragility, instead, their fragilities are imperfectly similar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil\xE2\x80\x99s ontology grounds his strong defense of the <i>token-token</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> identity theory that every mental quality (or </span><i>mode</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) of an object is identical with a neurological quality of that object. In Heil\xE2\x80\x99s view, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe can accept levels of organization, levels of complexity, levels of description, and levels of explanation, without commitment to levels of reality in the sense embraced by many self-proclaimed anti-reductionist philosophers today. The upshot is a conception of the world that is ontologically, but not analytically, reductive\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 10).<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\">Heil builds a powerful case for his central claims. Still, I have questions about some important matters of detail. I now turn to these details.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Truth.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Given his critique of the Picture Theory, Heil doubts that abstract propositions are \xE2\x80\x9Cintermediaries standing between the world and statements or assertions about the world\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 9). Yet, as he acknowledges, it is difficult to believe that for every way the world is, there is a <i>concrete representation</i></span> of its being that way (pp. 55, 72). Intuitively, though, for every way the world is, it is <i>true</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that it is that way. E.g., it seems that if, at a time, </span><i>t</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, three billion years ago, nothing concretely represents the Earth as existing, because, at </span><i>t</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, there is no life on Earth, then, at </span><i>t</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, it is nonetheless </span><i>true</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that the Earth exists at </span><i>t</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. So, it seems that for every way the world is, there is an </span><i>abstract representation</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, that is to say, a </span><i>proposition</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, about its being that way. Heil challenges the proponents of propositions as truth-bearers to provide an account of the relation between propositions and truth-makers (p. 73). Since there is no apparent difference between a </span><i>true proposition</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and an </span><i>obtaining state of affairs</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, truth seems not to be a matter of a proposition\xE2\x80\x99s </span><i>corresponding</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to an obtaining state of affairs. I\xE2\x80\x99m inclined to respond that propositions are true in virtue of their correspondence to </span><i>existing states</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, where a </span><i>state</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is understood as </span><i>an entity\xE2\x80\x99s having an attribute</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Thus, a proposition, </span><i>p</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, is true just when there is an entity, </span><i>e</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and a state, </span><i>s</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, such that: </span><i>s</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is identical with </span><i>e</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\xE2\x80\x99s having the attribute of being such that </span><i>p</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. E.g., the proposition </span><i>that Fido chases Morris</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is </span><i>true</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, just when there exists a </span><i>state</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of </span><i>Fido</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> identical with </span><i>Fido\xE2\x80\x99s having the attribute of being such that Fido chases Morris</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Since there </span><i>is</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> a clear distinction between truth and </span><i>existence</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and since, while propositions are </span><i>abstract</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, states of </span><i>concreta</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> are concrete, a </span><i>true proposition</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and an </span><i>existing state</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> seem to be different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Transcendent Universals.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> Heil finds it very odd that we could arrive at the existence of sharable Platonic properties \xE2\x80\x9Csolely on the basis of philosophical theorizing\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 149). The Platonic realist may plausibly respond that this isn\xE2\x80\x99t so odd because, even so, these transcendent universals are hypothesized on the ground that they figure in the best explanation of <i>highly general</i></span> <i>facts</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> about what we </span><i>experience</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Undetachable Spatial Parts.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> Heil defends a peculiar notion of the \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D of a compound object like a book (p. 174). Heil claims that such a \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D is an <i>undetachable spatial part</i></span> of a compound object, unlike <i>the portion of matter</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that coincides with this \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D, which he takes to be a detachable part of the compound object in question. Yet, as Heil admits, the \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D and the \xE2\x80\x9Cbottom half\xE2\x80\x9D of a compound object do not </span><i>make up</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that object (p. 100). But, surely, if so, then the \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D and the \xE2\x80\x9Cbottom half\xE2\x80\x9D could not be </span><i>parts</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of such an object. The notion that the \xE2\x80\x9Ctop half\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cbottom half\xE2\x80\x9D of a compound object are undetachable parts of that object seems to confuse parts of </span><i>space</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> with parts of an </span><i>object</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that </span><i>occupies</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> space.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Higher-Order Properties.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> \xE2\x80\x9CAn apparent difficulty with appeals to higher-order properties to account for property similarities is that second-order properties themselves bear similarity relations to one another: scarlet and crimson are similar in being red; red, blue, and orange are similar in being colors; and colours, shapes, and textures are similar in being properties. If we invoke higher-order properties to account for these similarities, we shall need a hierarchy of higher-order properties, and this looks like the start of an unhappy regress. Worse, perhaps, as we ascend the hierarchy, we move further away from our original conception of similarity. Shapes, colours, and textures are all properties, but are they thereby similar?\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 155). However, since there must be a <i>single</i></span> <i>summum genus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> at the apex of such a hierarchy of higher-order properties, it is hard to understand why Heil is concerned about the possibility of a regress. Continuing on the upward path where Heil leaves off, properties, relations, and propositions are all </span><i>abstracta</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and </span><i>abstracta</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and </span><i>concreta</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> are all entities. </span><i>Being an entity</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is a limiting case of an ontological category. Since </span><i>being an entity</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> is the </span><i>summum genus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, the regress stops there. Whether or not this </span><i>summum genus</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> counts as a property, it will be a brute fact </span><i>that all entities are similar in being entities</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. But it seems harmless that this is a brute fact. Finally, why think that as we ascend the hierarchy we are moving away from our original conception of similarity, as opposed to our considering items that are similar in increasingly abstract ways?<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Colors.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Heil defends a Lockean account of colors. Colors are dispositions of things to cause sensations of color in us; things have these dispositions in virtue of their micro-structural qualities. An account of this kind has the highly plausible consequence that our sensations of color do not <i>resemble</i></span> the things that cause them. Yet, such an account conflicts with an intuitive na\xC3\xAFve conception of colors as a distinctive class of visually perceivable qualities of things. I wonder whether Heil takes this conflict seriously enough. If one believes that this conflict provides a decisive objection to a dispositional account of color, then one may well conclude that our everyday attributions of colors to objects are <i>false</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> and that only sensations or the like are really colored.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s Razor.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> \xE2\x80\x9CEven if simplicity is limited to numbers of entities posited, this surely must be understood as pertaining, not to the number of particular entities, but to the number of <i>kinds</i></span> of entity. You do not simplify physics by cutting down on the number of electrons\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 147). However, the considerations adduced by Copernicus in favor of his heliocentric theory seem to provide a historically prominent counterexample to these claims. Copernicus cogently argued that because his heliocentric theory needed <i>far fewer epicycles</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> than the prevailing geocentric theory, his theory was superior (</span><i>even though epicycles were still needed</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Primitive Similarites.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> Heil\xE2\x80\x99s modes stand in primitive relations of perfect similarity and imperfect similarity. Since Heil rejects universals, he seems to be committed to the existence of relations in the sense of <i>particularized</i></span> ways in which things are related. Because there appear to be indefinitely many particular ways in which things are perfectly or imperfectly similar, it seems that Heil\xE2\x80\x99s ontology requires <i>indefinitely many</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> primitive relations. Yet, primitive relations should not be multiplied unnecessarily. These considerations raise questions about whether Heil\xE2\x80\x99s ontology of modes is as theoretically advantageous as it might appear to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16pt;\"><b>Substances.</b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> \xE2\x80\x9CA commitment to an ontology of objects, however, is not a commitment to material corpuscles. What the fundamental objects are is anybody\xE2\x80\x99s guess. The answer is not something to be had a priori, but only by appeal to empirical theories advanced in basic physics. We need not imagine that the fundamental objects are particle-like. Objects could be fields. Perhaps there is but a single object: space, or space-time, or some all-embracing quantum field\xE2\x80\x9D (p. 177). Heil\xE2\x80\x99s claim that space-time or the like could be a <i>substance</i></span> is unintuitive. Indeed, it seems possible that the universe is best understood in terms of space-time and an <i>event ontology</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. This seems to imply that space-time is necessarily </span><i>insubstantial</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. Moreover, Heil\xE2\x80\x99s characterization of a substance as . </span><i>possessor of properties not itself a property</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> (p. 179) does not seem to lend theoretical support to his claim, since it seems that non-substantial entities other than properties possess properties, e.g., events, collections, and boundaries. Thus, Heil\xE2\x80\x99s characterization of substance seems not to provide a sufficient condition for substantiality. So, it is far from clear that if space-time is a possessor of properties not itself a property, then space-time is a substance. For these reasons, I do not find it plausible that space-time or the like could be a substance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   According to Heil, our belief that ordinary items like lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people are <i>substances</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> could turn out to be false. For example, such items could turn out to be </span><i>qualities</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> [of regions of space-time]. Heil also defends the thesis that if this belief were to turn out to be false, then it would nonetheless be </span><i>true</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> that </span><i>there are</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people. Heil defends this thesis by arguing that our </span><i>concepts</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of such items are </span><i>not</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> concepts of </span><i>substances</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, but rather, are concepts of items that possess certain properties or stand in certain relations, although our tacit acceptance of the Picture Theory could well lead us to mistakenly think otherwise. I find this defense unconvincing because </span><i>prima facie</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> it is a </span><i>category mistake</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> to characterize ordinary items like lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people as </span><i>insubstantial</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, e.g., as </span><i>qualities</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">. If characterizing such items as insubstantial </span><i>is</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> a category mistake, then our </span><i>concepts</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> of items of this kind </span><i>are</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> concepts of </span><i>substances</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, and such items could </span><i>not</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> turn out to be insubstantial. In that case, if our belief that there are </span><i>substantial</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people were to turn out to be false, then it would </span><i>not</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> be true that </span><i>there are</i><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> lumps of bronze, statues, mountains, trees, and people.</span>"
