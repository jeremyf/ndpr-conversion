content: "<p>This book contains thirteen of Field\xE2\x80\x99s previously published papers. The earliest was published in 1972; the latest, in 2000. The papers are loosely connected by their focus on various issues, global and more local, concerning truth and meaning. While for the most part the papers appear in their original published form, Field has added postscripts to eight of the papers. The postscripts vary considerably in length and contain amplification, clarification, or criticism of positions advanced in the original papers.</p>  \n\
  <p>The five papers in Part 1 (<i>Truth, Meaning and Propositional Attitudes</i>) trace the evolution of Field\xE2\x80\x99s thought from a somewhat sympathetic (though still critical) treatment of Tarski\xE2\x80\x99s theory of truth, to a robust defense of an unabashedly deflationary account of both truth and meaning/content. The early discussion of Tarski developed concerns about a \xE2\x80\x9Chidden\xE2\x80\x9D reliance on unanalyzed semantic concepts. The deflationary account of the content of sentences, developed through a critical evaluation of Stalnaker\xE2\x80\x99s views on intentionality and through Field\xE2\x80\x99s two papers \xE2\x80\x9CDeflationary Views of Meaning and Content\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CAttributions of Meaning and Content,\xE2\x80\x9D is supposed to facilitate the development of a thoroughgoing deflationist program in which semantic concepts that appear in deflationary accounts of truth, themselves get a deflationary treatment. Although Field vigorously defends views, he is also particularly skilful at mapping the relevant differences in alternative approaches to understanding truth and content, and is refreshingly candid in conceding that there are sometimes no knock-down arguments in favor of one approach over another.</p>  \n\
  <p>There is one non-negotiable constraint on Field\xE2\x80\x99s willingness to take a philosophical position seriously: the position must be compatible with a hardheaded materialism. That materialism entails \xE2\x80\x9Cthat there be no irreducible mental objects or mental properties\xE2\x80\x9D (30). One of Field\xE2\x80\x99s main projects is to solve, or dissolve, what he calls Brentano\xE2\x80\x99s problem\xE2\x80\x94the problem of how to give a materialistic account of intentionality.</p>  \n\
  <p>The papers in Part 2 (<i>Indeterminism and Factual Deflationism</i>) deal with less global issues, focusing on problematic contexts for the ascription of truth and meaning. Field argues that one can accommodate insights about indeterminacy of translation, indeterminacy with respect to the referents of terms over theory change, and apparent failure of excluded middle, not only from within the framework of traditional correspondence theories of truth, but also presupposing the kind of minimalist, deflationary accounts of truth and content that Field now favors.</p>  \n\
  <p>In Part 3 (<i>Objectivity</i>), issues of objectivity are again engaged. The first two papers address issues concerning the status of mathematical truths and mathematical objects, and the relation between the decidability of a mathematical sentence and that sentence\xE2\x80\x99s having a determinate truth value. The topic of the last paper in this section is only tenuously connected with the topics of the first two. It begins with a characterization of the a priori as that which can be reasonably believed without empirical evidence and is empirically indefeasible (at least for computationally ideal epistemic subjects). Just as Field argues that certain well-formed mathematical sentences lack truth-value, so he appears to argue (more on this later) for a noncognitivist account of certain a priori sentences endorsing the legitimacy of fundamental principles of reasoning. </p>  \n\
  <p>It is obviously impossible to summarize adequately, let alone evaluate, the diverse, often dense and technical papers that make up this collection. The papers are among the most important and influential writings on truth and meaning. One also gets a valuable and interesting insight into the ways in which, and reasons for which, an important philosopher\xE2\x80\x99s views change over time. The postscripts, in particular, highlight issues that were pivotal for Field. The insight gained is enhanced by Field\xE2\x80\x99s candor, which leads him to admit when he is genuinely uncertain and when he sees complications or problems for his views. </p>  \n\
  <p>Rather than try to say a bit about a great many issues, I\xE2\x80\x99ll raise just a few questions about a couple of themes. I\xE2\x80\x99ll focus primarily on Field\xE2\x80\x99s most recent deflationary views on truth and content and on his papers on apriority as an evaluative concept.</p>  \n\
  <p>Before raising these more particular concerns, however, I want to comment in passing on Field\xE2\x80\x99s resolute commitment to materialism. There is, of course, nothing wrong with a philosopher\xE2\x80\x99s simply announcing presuppositions of an approach and working within the framework defined by those presuppositions. In the interest of full disclosure, I should indicate, however, that most of the views I take to be true are dismissed by Field in footnotes. I would have liked a more extensive discussion of just what is and is not supposed to be consistent with a thoroughgoing materialistic worldview. Cartesian mental substance is out, and so are irreducibly mental properties. But what makes a property irreducibly, and thus problematically, mental? Is it that the predicate expressions in question cannot plausibly be construed as co-referential with predicate expressions favored by one or more of the physical sciences? Of course, neurophysiologists <i>employ</i> both the language of \xE2\x80\x9Cfolk psychology\xE2\x80\x9D and the more technical vocabulary of their specialized field. Qua neurophysiologists, I don\xE2\x80\x99t think that they are particularly competent to evaluate <i>philosophical</i> views about property identity. </p>  \n\
  <p>In a way it seems to me a bit odd for a deflationist to worry all that much about when predicate expressions are or are not problematic. After all, one gives the same deflationary account of the content of \xE2\x80\x9Cpain\xE2\x80\x9D that one gives of the technical predicates employed by the neurophysiologist. Certainly, for most people, including neurophysiologists, the inferential role and indication relations (Field\xE2\x80\x99s suggestion for replacing meaning as truth conditions with something else) seem to be quite different for sentences about pain than they are for descriptions of neural events\xE2\x80\x94most of us think that we can <i>know</i> truths about when we are in pain in ways in which we cannot know propositions describing neural events, for example.</p>  \n\
  <p>Are properties respectable posits for a materialist or must we favor sets? If properties are OK, can a self-respecting materialist construe those properties as universals? Apparently, it\xE2\x80\x99s all right to include within one\xE2\x80\x99s materialist ontology sentence types as necessary existents (120, note 18), but it\xE2\x80\x99s hard to see how such philosophical commitments are any less mysterious than the property dualist\xE2\x80\x99s irreducible thoughts \xE2\x80\x93 posits that play for the dualist precisely the same role as the \xE2\x80\x9Cinternalized\xE2\x80\x9D intrinsically unambiguous sentences (135) that can bear truth value for Field.\r\n\
  </p> <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Deflationary Accounts of Truth and Content</p>   \n\
  <p>Let me make a few polemical remarks about Field\xE2\x80\x99s deflationary account of truth and meaning/content, remarks that may indicate that I am still in the grips of an inflationist illness Field is trying to cure. According to Field, we need to explain the \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual necessity\xE2\x80\x9D of both sentences of the form:</p>  <blockquote>1)\t\xE2\x80\x9Cp\xE2\x80\x9D is true iff p</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>and</p>  <blockquote>2)\t\xE2\x80\x9Cp\xE2\x80\x9D means that p</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>The first difficulty, of course, is that, 1) and 2) are obviously <i>not</i> necessary. There are clearly possible worlds in which the <i>symbols</i> \xE2\x80\x9CGrass is green\xE2\x80\x9D don\xE2\x80\x99t mean that grass is green and, consequently, aren\xE2\x80\x99t true when and only when grass is green. Field is clearly aware of the problem and for that reason modifies his deflationary accounts so that they apply to sentences <i>understood a certain way</i>. What is necessarily true are the following:</p>  <blockquote>1a) \xE2\x80\x9Cp\xE2\x80\x9D (as I now understand it) is true iff p</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>and</p>  <blockquote>2a) \xE2\x80\x9Cp\xE2\x80\x9D (as I now understand it) means that p.</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>Consider 2a). Even <i>it</i> is not a necessary truth unless we take the parenthetical description as a \xE2\x80\x9Crigid\xE2\x80\x9D description of our particular understanding of \xE2\x80\x9Cp\xE2\x80\x9D. If we do, however, then isn\xE2\x80\x99t 2a) really equivalent to something like the following:</p>  <blockquote>2b) \xE2\x80\x9Cp\xE2\x80\x9D (when it means that p) means that p.</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>Leaving aside the fact that the symbols might not exist, we do now have a plausible candidate for a conceptual truth, but we have achieved our goal by reducing our account of meaning to an utterly trivial tautology providing no philosophical insight into meaning. The inflationist about truth and meaning is surely going to argue that the analogous account of truth, relying as it does, on our <i>understanding</i> of an interpreted sentence, implicitly explains the truth of a sentence by appealing to the fact that it <i>derivatively</i> shares the truth of the thought/proposition/content/understanding that it conveys.</p>  \n\
  <p>Why are inflationists so frustrated with the deflationist\xE2\x80\x99s account of truth and meaning? I suspect that the heart of the concern may lie with the inflationist\xE2\x80\x99s conviction that we must distinguish two importantly different ways in which one thing can represent (stand for, be about) another. Language, for example, represents by convention. We <i>assign</i> meanings to words and other symbols. But we can only do so if we have some independent way of representing that which we want symbols to conventionally represent. If the \xE2\x80\x9Clanguage\xE2\x80\x9D of thought itself represents only conventionally we would be threatened with a vicious regress. Russell and Frege sought (in different ways) to end the regress with nonconventional representation of a sort that Field dismisses as utterly mysterious. Causal theorists seek to end the regress in a way that greatly expands the class of items that refer naturally (independently of convention). Deflationists unapologetically seem to have nothing to say about how one thing succeeds in representing or standing for another.</p>  \n\
  <p>Field\xE2\x80\x99s internalized sentences seem to me to be suspiciously like internalized Fregean thoughts. Unlike ordinary sentences they are intrinsically unambiguous. They don\xE2\x80\x99t seem anything like the more familiar marks or sounds that constitute the sentences of a natural language. Field is unimpressed by the difference. After all, marks and sounds themselves aren\xE2\x80\x99t that much like each other either. But the differences go beyond the \xE2\x80\x9Cstuff\xE2\x80\x9D out of which the \xE2\x80\x9Clanguage\xE2\x80\x9D is constituted. Internalized sentences come with their constituent \xE2\x80\x9Cterms\xE2\x80\x9D intrinsically tied to their contents in a way in which the words of a natural language are not. When one introduces a truth bearer this mysterious, perhaps one shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t disparage too strongly the dualist who introduces some admittedly very odd properties to perform the very odd job that Field wants internalized sentences to perform.</p>  \n\
  <p>Before concluding these few very brief and far too crude comments on deflationary accounts of meaning and truth, let me add one more minor reservation about the way in which Field talks about intentional states. At least sometimes, Field seems to suggest that our intentional states like beliefs and desires are relations we stand in to sentences (55, 109). This strikes me as a kind of category mistake. If you told me that someone desired a <i>sentence</i>, I would think that a very odd sort of desire indeed. It seems to me that a more plausible view would be the analogue of a kind of adverbial analysis of mental states. There are these internalized sentences but they are a genus that comes in different species. Some internalized states <i>are</i> beliefs, others <i>are</i> fears, others <i>are</i> desires, and so on. They all have meaning (captured by the deflationary theory) but the sentence comes \xE2\x80\x9Ctyped\xE2\x80\x9D as a belief sentence, a fear sentence, or a desire sentence.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

  <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Evaluative Character of Fundamental Epistemic Claims</span></p>   \n\
  <p>Field\xE2\x80\x99s account of the modal status of fundamental principles of reasoning is both interesting and original. As I indicated earlier, he appears to develop a noncognitivist account of our \xE2\x80\x9Cendorsement\xE2\x80\x9D of fundamental rules of reasoning, an account that rejects both the alleged mysteries of a priori intuition and the reliabilist\xE2\x80\x99s efforts to turn principles of reasoning into empirical claims about the truth-conduciveness of certain ways of producing beliefs.</p>  \n\
  <p>Given that it has become almost a mantra for many contemporary epistemologists that epistemic concepts (like justification) are <i>normative</i>, it\xE2\x80\x99s a bit surprising that noncognitivist accounts of epistemic judgments are not more commonplace. The paradigm of a normative judgment, after all, is an ethical judgment and some philosophers interested in metaethics have long taken seriously the idea that there is a fundamental distinction between ethical sentences that have <i>prescriptive</i> meaning and other sorts of sentences that have <i>descriptive</i> meaning. The sharpest contrast between the two sorts of meanings was drawn by philosophers like Hare who claimed that moral statements are grammatically disguised imperatives. </p>  \n\
  <p>Now it is not clear to me that Field really <i>is</i> a noncognitivist concerning the evaluation of rules of inferences. At least some of the time his emphasis seems to be on goals or ends, where evaluation involves judgments about the way in which to achieve these goals or ends. On such a view, one can indeed argue that <i>as a factual matter</i> one method of forming beliefs is better than another <i>relative to one\xE2\x80\x99s goals or end</i>s (defined in terms of one\xE2\x80\x99s fundamental values). Field says as much himself:</p>  <blockquote>But nothing I have said implies that no standards are better than others. Indeed, some clearly are better. Of course, in saying that makes them \xE2\x80\x98better\xE2\x80\x99 I am presupposing a goal\xE2\x80\xA6 . (382)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>But if there are facts about what we value (what our goals are) and facts about what maximizes satisfaction of goals or ends, then there are facts about which methods of forming beliefs are good. <i>Relativism</i> is not noncognitivism. One can <i>turn</i> this goal-oriented account of the content of epistemic evaluative claims into a version of noncognitivism by invoking the old emotivist distinction between expressing and describing values, or by invoking a prescriptivist understanding of value claims. But I\xE2\x80\x99m not sure what advantage there would be to doing so other than a dogged commitment to advancing noncognitivism.</p>  \n\
  <p>What reservations might one have about the goal-oriented account? The first, discussed by Field, involves the worry that we are confusing epistemic evaluation with non-epistemic evaluation. In an early footnote (#3, 361), Field says he is not interested in \xE2\x80\x9Ccrassly pragmatic motivation for or against believing.\xE2\x80\x9D But one worries that in leaving open the range of goals that an agent might adopt in epistemically evaluating belief, he is guilty of conflating (crassly or not) pragmatic and epistemic evaluation. In the end, I think Field takes the distinction between epistemic and pragmatic evaluation to be a matter of relatively uninteresting semantic stipulation (385). Is he right?</p>  \n\
  <p>In the first part of his paper, Field argues that a (computationally) ideal epistemic agent doesn\xE2\x80\x99t select or revise <i>fundamental</i> epistemic principles on the basis of empirical evidence. One problem is that if the principle truly were fundamental, one would need to use the principle to test itself. He argues that because our fundamental principles can build in the capacity for self-correction, one can never be forced by counter-evidence to reject the principle. I\xE2\x80\x99m not sure he is right about this. It seems to me, for example, that one can find oneself employing a principle that one treats as fundamental and that reveals itself as internally and irremediably unstable \xE2\x80\x93 the employment of memory to discover massive problems of misremembering might leave me in a position in which I must reach the conclusion that on the supposition that memory is reliable, it isn\xE2\x80\x99t reliable. But this is a difficult question. </p>  \n\
  <p>On the assumption that he is right about fundamental epistemic principles, Field suggests that the relevant epistemic question when it comes to \xE2\x80\x9Cchoosing\xE2\x80\x9D a principle (such as modus ponens) is \xE2\x80\x9CWhy value a methodology that allows the use of modus ponens on no evidence?\xE2\x80\x9D (371). It seems to me, however, that there is an implicit \xE2\x80\x9Cshould\xE2\x80\x9D in the relevant question: Why <i>should</i> we value one fundamental epistemic principle over another? If one gives a pragmatic (goal-oriented) interpretation of this question, I think there may be a problem. I have argued elsewhere that what one pragmatically ought to do is <i>not</i> most naturally understood in terms of what <i>will</i> (perhaps through sheer luck) maximize satisfaction of one\xE2\x80\x99s goals. Rather, the pragmatic \xE2\x80\x9Cought\xE2\x80\x9D should be understood in terms of what we are epistemically <i>justified</i> in believing concerning the achievement of goals or ends. But if such a view were correct, we\xE2\x80\x99d be relying on fundamental epistemic concepts in our attempt to understand the epistemic/pragmatic evaluation of epistemic principles.</p>  \n\
  <p>The above critical comments are obviously made by one who approaches many of the topics Field addresses from a quite different perspective. Anyone interested in deflationary accounts of meaning and truth and the way in which one can approach a host of problems from within such an approach will find this collection of essays invaluable. Field\xE2\x80\x99s work has shaped importantly and lastingly the philosophical dialogue on these topics.</p>"

  </p> <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Deflationary Accounts of Truth and Content</p>   \n\
  <p>Let me make a few polemical remarks about Field\xE2\x80\x99s deflationary account of truth and meaning/content, remarks that may indicate that I am still in the grips of an inflationist illness Field is trying to cure. According to Field, we need to explain the \xE2\x80\x9Cconceptual necessity\xE2\x80\x9D of both sentences of the form:</p>  <blockquote>1)\t\xE2\x80\x9Cp\xE2\x80\x9D is true iff p</blockquote>  \n\

  <p>The first difficulty, of course, is that, 1) and 2) are obviously <i>not</i> necessary. There are clearly possible worlds in which the <i>symbols</i> \xE2\x80\x9CGrass is green\xE2\x80\x9D don\xE2\x80\x99t mean that grass is green and, consequently, aren\xE2\x80\x99t true when and only when grass is green.

  <p>Consider 2a). Even <i>it</i> is not a necessary truth unless we take the parenthetical description as a \xE2\x80\x9Crigid\xE2\x80\x9D description of our particular understanding of \xE2\x80\x9Cp\xE2\x80\x9D.

Deflationists unapologetically seem to have nothing to say about how one thing succeeds in representing or standing for another.</p>  \n\
  <p>Field\xE2\x80\x99s internalized sentences seem to me to be suspiciously like internalized Fregean thoughts. Unlike ordinary sentences they are intrinsically unambiguous. They don\xE2\x80\x99t seem anything like the more familiar marks or sounds that constitute the sentences of a natural language. Field is unimpressed by the difference. After all, marks and sounds themselves aren\xE2\x80\x99t that much like each other either. But the differences go beyond the \xE2\x80\x9Cstuff\xE2\x80\x9D out of which the \xE2\x80\x9Clanguage\xE2\x80\x9D is constituted. Internalized sentences come with their constituent \xE2\x80\x9Cterms\xE2\x80\x9D intrinsically tied to their contents in a way in which the words of a natural language are not. When one introduces a truth bearer this mysterious, perhaps one shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t disparage too strongly the dualist who introduces some admittedly very odd properties to perform the very odd job that Field wants internalized sentences to perform.</p>  \n\
  <p>Before concluding these few very brief and far too crude comments on deflationary accounts of meaning and truth, let me add one more minor reservation about the way in which Field talks about intentional states. At least sometimes, Field seems to suggest that our intentional states like beliefs and desires are relations we stand in to sentences (55, 109). This strikes me as a kind of category mistake. If you told me that someone desired a <i>sentence</i>, I would think that a very odd sort of desire indeed. It seems to me that a more plausible view would be the analogue of a kind of adverbial analysis of mental states. There are these internalized sentences but they are a genus that comes in different species. Some internalized states <i>are</i> beliefs, others <i>are</i> fears, others <i>are</i> desires, and so on. They all have meaning (captured by the deflationary theory) but the sentence comes \xE2\x80\x9Ctyped\xE2\x80\x9D as a belief sentence, a fear sentence, or a desire sentence.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\r\n\

  <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Evaluative Character of Fundamental Epistemic Claims</span></p>   \n\
  <p>Field\xE2\x80\x99s account of the modal status of fundamental principles of reasoning is both interesting and original. As I indicated earlier, he appears to develop a noncognitivist account of our \xE2\x80\x9Cendorsement\xE2\x80\x9D of fundamental rules of reasoning, an account that rejects both the alleged mysteries of a priori intuition and the reliabilist\xE2\x80\x99s efforts to turn principles of reasoning into empirical claims about the truth-conduciveness of certain ways of producing beliefs.</p>  \n\
  <p>Given that it has become almost a mantra for many contemporary epistemologists that epistemic concepts (like justification) are <i>normative</i>, it\xE2\x80\x99s a bit surprising that noncognitivist accounts of epistemic judgments are not more commonplace. The paradigm of a normative judgment, after all, is an ethical judgment and some philosophers interested in metaethics have long taken seriously the idea that there is a fundamental distinction between ethical sentences that have <i>prescriptive</i> meaning and other sorts of sentences that have <i>descriptive</i> meaning. The sharpest contrast between the two sorts of meanings was drawn by philosophers like Hare who claimed that moral statements are grammatically disguised imperatives. </p>  \n\
  <p>Now it is not clear to me that Field really <i>is</i> a noncognitivist concerning the evaluation of rules of inferences. At least some of the time his emphasis seems to be on goals or ends, where evaluation involves judgments about the way in which to achieve these goals or ends. On such a view, one can indeed argue that <i>as a factual matter</i> one method of forming beliefs is better than another <i>relative to one\xE2\x80\x99s goals or end</i>s (defined in terms of one\xE2\x80\x99s fundamental values). Field says as much himself:</p>  <blockquote>But nothing I have said implies that no standards are better than others. Indeed, some clearly are better. Of course, in saying that makes them \xE2\x80\x98better\xE2\x80\x99 I am presupposing a goal\xE2\x80\xA6 . (382)</blockquote>  \n\
  <p>But if there are facts about what we value (what our goals are) and facts about what maximizes satisfaction of goals or ends, then there are facts about which methods of forming beliefs are good. <i>Relativism</i> is not noncognitivism. One can <i>turn</i> this goal-oriented account of the content of epistemic evaluative claims into a version of noncognitivism by invoking the old emotivist distinction between expressing and describing values, or by invoking a prescriptivist understanding of value claims. But I\xE2\x80\x99m not sure what advantage there would be to doing so other than a dogged commitment to advancing noncognitivism.</p>  \n\
  <p>What reservations might one have about the goal-oriented account? The first, discussed by Field, involves the worry that we are confusing epistemic evaluation with non-epistemic evaluation. In an early footnote (#3, 361), Field says he is not interested in \xE2\x80\x9Ccrassly pragmatic motivation for or against believing.\xE2\x80\x9D But one worries that in leaving open the range of goals that an agent might adopt in epistemically evaluating belief, he is guilty of conflating (crassly or not) pragmatic and epistemic evaluation. In the end, I think Field takes the distinction between epistemic and pragmatic evaluation to be a matter of relatively uninteresting semantic stipulation (385). Is he right?</p>  \n\
  <p>In the first part of his paper, Field argues that a (computationally) ideal epistemic agent doesn\xE2\x80\x99t select or revise <i>fundamental</i> epistemic principles on the basis of empirical evidence. One problem is that if the principle truly were fundamental, one would need to use the principle to test itself. He argues that because our fundamental principles can build in the capacity for self-correction, one can never be forced by counter-evidence to reject the principle. I\xE2\x80\x99m not sure he is right about this. It seems to me, for example, that one can find oneself employing a principle that one treats as fundamental and that reveals itself as internally and irremediably unstable \xE2\x80\x93 the employment of memory to discover massive problems of misremembering might leave me in a position in which I must reach the conclusion that on the supposition that memory is reliable, it isn\xE2\x80\x99t reliable. But this is a difficult question. </p>  \n\
  <p>On the assumption that he is right about fundamental epistemic principles, Field suggests that the relevant epistemic question when it comes to \xE2\x80\x9Cchoosing\xE2\x80\x9D a principle (such as modus ponens) is \xE2\x80\x9CWhy value a methodology that allows the use of modus ponens on no evidence?\xE2\x80\x9D (371). It seems to me, however, that there is an implicit \xE2\x80\x9Cshould\xE2\x80\x9D in the relevant question: Why <i>should</i> we value one fundamental epistemic principle over another? If one gives a pragmatic (goal-oriented) interpretation of this question, I think there may be a problem. I have argued elsewhere that what one pragmatically ought to do is <i>not</i> most naturally understood in terms of what <i>will</i> (perhaps through sheer luck) maximize satisfaction of one\xE2\x80\x99s goals. Rather, the pragmatic \xE2\x80\x9Cought\xE2\x80\x9D should be understood in terms of what we are epistemically <i>justified</i> in believing concerning the achievement of goals or ends. But if such a view were correct, we\xE2\x80\x99d be relying on fundamental epistemic concepts in our attempt to understand the epistemic/pragmatic evaluation of epistemic principles.</p>  \n\
  <p>The above critical comments are obviously made by one who approaches many of the topics Field addresses from a quite different perspective. Anyone interested in deflationary accounts of meaning and truth and the way in which one can approach a host of problems from within such an approach will find this collection of essays invaluable. Field\xE2\x80\x99s work has shaped importantly and lastingly the philosophical dialogue on these topics.</p>"
