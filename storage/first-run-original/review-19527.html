	 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">It was the best of books. It was the worst of books. Best because it was filled with interesting and original arguments about the nature and possibility of knowledge. Worst because the arguments were good, much better than I had hoped given that they were arguments against an attractive constellation of views. Many of us aren't skeptics and are fallibilists. Many of us never suspected that there was a pragmatic dimension to knowledge. We were enquiring minds and we wanted to know. The epistemologists were supposed to tell us what it takes to have knowledge and it wasn't any of their business why we wanted to know or what we wanted to do with our knowledge. Fantl and McGrath will try to convince you that this cannot all be right and force you to choose between an infallibilist view that seems to make skepticism irresistible and a fallibilist view that might avoid skepticism, but only by allowing for pragmatic encroachment. On the view they prefer, if it matters more to me whether <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> than it does to you, it can be harder for me to know if <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is true than it is for you. Even if we have the same evidence and the same attitudes, so that our epistemic positions with respect to <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> are equally strong, you might be in a position to know things I am not. Before getting into the overview, let me say that working through the puzzles having to do with the relations between knowledge, justification, and reasons for belief and action has been a great deal of fun. I cannot recall enjoying a book as much as I've enjoyed <i>Knowledge in an Uncertain World</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. I do have some reservations about their impurist view and their arguments for it. Luckily, since so much turns on whether they're right, if they're right, I might never have to concede to them that I know they are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Let's start with an overview. Fallibilists say that it's possible for you to know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> even if there is some non-zero chance (for you) that ~<i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. Lewis thought that fallibilism was mad. On this view the statement, 'I know that <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, but it might be that ~<i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">' could express a true proposition. The statement seems to be an overt statement of the fallibilist view and it seems contradictory. Fantl and McGrath think we can explain why the statement seems contradictory in Gricean terms: when you say 'It might be that ~<i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">', you pragmatically imply that there is a <i>significant</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> possibility of error.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> While <i>significant</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> chances of error threaten knowledge, not every chance of error is significant. Once we start distinguishing the significant chances of error that threaten knowledge from those that are harmless, it would be nice if we had something to say about this distinction. Fantl and McGrath think that one advantage that their impurist view has is that they can say something about the distinction: knowing <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> requires only that <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is probable enough for you properly to put <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> to work as a basis for belief and action (25).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In Chapter 2, they discuss some examples that suggest that our willingness to say someone 'knows' a proposition, <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, depends upon <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">'s practical significance. The question is whether these cases and our responses to them tell us something about 'knowledge' or knowledge. Consider DeRose's bank cases:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU"><i>Bank Case A</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. My wife and I are driving home on a Friday afternoon. We plan to stop at the bank on the way home to deposit our paychecks. But as we drive past the bank, we notice that the lines inside are very long, as they often are on Friday afternoons. Although we generally like to deposit our paychecks as soon as possible, it is not especially important in this case that they be deposited right away, so I suggest that we drive straight home and deposit our paychecks on Saturday morning. My wife says, 'Maybe the bank won't be open tomorrow. Lots of banks are closed on Saturdays.' I reply, 'No, I know it'll be open. I was just there two weeks ago on Saturday. It's open until noon.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU"><i>Bank Case B. </i></span><span lang="EN-AU">My wife and I drive past the bank on a Friday afternoon, as in Case A, and notice the long lines. I again suggest that we deposit our paychecks on Saturday morning, explaining that I was at the bank on Saturday morning only two weeks ago and discovered that it was open until noon. But in this case, we have just written a very large and important check. If our paychecks are not deposited into our checking account before Monday morning, the important check we wrote will bounce, leaving us in a <i>very </i></span><span lang="EN-AU">bad situation. And, of course, the bank is not open on Sunday. My wife reminds me of these facts. She then says, 'Banks do change their hours. Do you know the bank will be open tomorrow?' Remaining as confident as I was before that the bank will be open then, still, I reply, 'Well, no. I'd better go in and make sure.' (DeRose (1992: 913)).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">A contextualist could argue that the best explanation as to why it seems that both speakers speak the truth in these cases is that 'knows' picks out different relations in these two cases. Fantl and McGrath try to show how an invariantist (i.e., someone who thinks that the semantic value of 'knows' does not depend upon features of the conversational context (e.g., the salience of skeptical hypotheses, the stakes) can accommodate the data by appeal to the following principle: <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">Action: If you know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, it is proper for you to act on <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> in deciding what to do (49). <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Since what's proper for you to treat as a reason in these cases differ (i.e., it's proper to treat <i>that the bank will be open</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as a reason for action in the low stakes case but not the high), Action tells us that what's known will differ and we don't need to assume that 'knows', on our lips, picks out different relations when we describe cases where the practical stakes differ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In Chapters 3 and 4, Fantl and McGrath extend their argument against knowledge and justification purism by first arguing for KJ:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">KJ: If you know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is warranted enough to justify you in </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU">-ing, for any </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU">.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Armed with KJ, we can attack the fallibilist purist view by pointing to pairs of cases where subjects in these cases have equally strong epistemic positions with respect to <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> where we can make it intuitive to say that only one subject is warranted in treating <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as a reason for action by raising the practical stakes in one of the cases. For example, we might imagine Matt wants to take the express simply because he thinks the local is a minor inconvenience. We might think that if he overhears someone say that this train is the express, we might be prepared to say that it is okay for him to treat <i>that this train is the express</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as a reason for boarding. If Jeremy wants to take the express because he knows that if he misses the express and ends up on the local, he will not get his payment in to his bookie on time and will lose a finger, we probably would think that he should check to make sure this really is the train he needs. That he is not warranted in treating <i>that this train is the express</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as a reason for boarding suggests Matt knows something he does not until he investigates further.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">To defend the impurist view of justification, Fantl and McGrath argue that the warrant that knowledge provides is not lost if the proposition believed is false or the belief is Gettiered provided that the justification is held fixed. They then argue that we have sufficient justification for believing iff we have knowledge-level justification for believing. This is supposed to justify the transition from KJ to JJ: <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">JJ: If you are justified in believing <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is warranted enough to justify you in </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU">-ing, for any </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">There is a potential problem with their argument for an impurist view of knowledge and justification. It might be possible for someone to say that the truth conditions for ascriptions of knowledge and justified belief depend, in part, upon the practical significance of <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> for the subject because the practical significance of <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is part of what determines whether the subject believes <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. In Chapter 5, they grant that belief might have a pragmatic dimension in the sense that believing <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> requires that your credence in <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is sufficiently high for <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> to be your motivating reason for you to </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU"> for some connected </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU">. They do not think that this weak pragmatist view of belief undercuts the case for impurism about knowledge and justification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In Chapter 6, Fantl and McGrath discuss the value and importance of knowledge. They are skeptical of the idea that our interest in knowledge might be due to the fact that we take knowledge to be always <i>prima facie</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> valuable. Instead, the importance of knowledge is that it figures in useful philosophical principles. They reject Williamson's suggestion that knowledge is what warrants assertion. For them, the concept of knowledge plays an essential role in a fallibilist account of justified belief and the warranted use of justifying reasons for action. To justifiably believe <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> requires not just some justification, but knowledge-level justification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In Chapter 7, Fantl and McGrath take up the question as to whether we should prefer an infallibilist purist view or a fallibilist impurist view. KJ, they say, shows that fallibilist purism is false. They think fallibilist<b> </b></span><span lang="EN-AU">impurism<b><i> </i></b></span><span lang="EN-AU">is the better of the two views. It seems that the infallibilist purist view leads to skepticism. On this view, we can only know humdrum truths (e.g., here's a hand, Texas is not on the moon, Al Gore is not a horse) if the epistemic probability of these truths for you is 1. Since it's obviously irrational to put up something of trivial value against your life in betting on these truths, the infallibilist has to concede that these are not known.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The book contains two appendixes. In the first, Fantl and McGrath explain that we do not need to choose between KJ and Bayesian decision theory. In the second, they address the worry that KJ commits them to infallibilism. If it did, they could not use KJ to motivate fallibilist impurism. They argue that infallibilism is not a consequence of KJ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-AU">Critical Evaluation<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-AU">(i) Knowledge<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">An initial complaint Fantl and McGrath lodge against fallibilism is that the fallibilist makes a distinction between significant and insignificant possibilities of error. The distinction is supposed to help us see how it could be that someone could know even if there is some chance that they are wrong. The problem is that the purist fallibilist has no good answer to the question, 'How probable must <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> be to be known?' (25). They suggest that the fallibilist should put knowledge to work -- the possibility of error is not significant if you can properly put <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> to work as a reason for action or belief. I don't see how we could possibly answer the question 'How probable must <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> be to be put to work?' without opting for views they don't like (e.g., if <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is absolutely certain). So, I don't think the real problem with purist fallibilism is that it's less informative than impurist fallibilism. The real problem for purist fallibilism is how it handles high/low stakes cases. You can argue against fallibilist purism directly by appeal to intuitions about knowledge ascription and denial or indirectly by appeal to KJ and the observation that whether we are warranted in treating <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as a reason for action will depend, in part, upon the practical significance of <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">It's difficult to evaluate the direct attack against fallibilist purism. Assume that in Bank Case B the speaker speaks <i>properly</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> in saying 'I don't know'. Even if we assume that propriety is a good guide to <i>correctness</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, you might think that subjects that take themselves not to know will, normally, not have the belief in the proposition they take themselves not to know. (Subjects that believe <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> while believing themselves not to know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> suffer from a kind of madness that makes Moore's Paradox so interesting.) Without a belief, there's no knowledge, but the explanation as to why there's no knowledge in the high stakes case makes no use of the hypothesis that (crudely put) it is harder to know when the stakes are high than it is to know when they are low. To deal with this sort of worry, Fantl and McGrath suggest we can stipulate that the subject in Bank Case B has the belief that the bank will be open but think that if the subject said that he knew that the bank would be open, he would speak falsely. I have to confess that I don't share this intuition. I'm not saying that I find their claim counterintuitive, only that I'm not moved to accept it or deny it. If the speaker said 'I know', I would not object. As we fill in more and more of the details to block purist fallibilist explanations as to why subjects in high stakes cases lack knowledge or error theories that explain why subjects speak as if this is so, the intuitions that I'd have to have to<b> </b></span><span lang="EN-AU">be moved by the direct attack on purist fallibilism start to wane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The worry isn't just that once all the potential wrinkles in the direct attack on purist fallibilism are ironed out I don't have the intuition that subjects in high stakes cases speak falsely when they say they claim to know what Fantl and McGrath say they don't. Further, I find the impurist fallibilist's claims positively counterintuitive. Consider: <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">You: Have you seen Audrey?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">Me: No, I haven't. Have you asked Ben?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">You: You think he might know where she is?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">Me: I guess that depends. He probably knows if you just wanted to go get coffee with her, but it's less likely he knows if you need to know where she is to save her from ninjas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">I don't think the last remark could be in good order. Suppose, however, that I know that you and Ben both know why you need to find Audrey and so know you two know whether this is a high or low stakes case. I can't see how the impurist could say that these remarks must be out of order, so if we're just pitting intuition against intuition, I'm not yet convinced that the impurist enjoys a clear advantage over the purist when it comes to knowledge attributions and denials.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The indirect argument against purist fallibilism can help shoulder the burden. To save the impurist fallibilist view of knowledge, we either have to deny KJ or deny that changes in the stakes can change what level of justification is needed to have sufficient warrant to treat something as the basis for action. In defense of purist fallibilism, someone might target KJ. According to KJ, if <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is known, it is proper for you to put <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> to work in reasoning about what to do. Suppose <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is some mundane proposition we think we're in a good position to know on the basis of fallible grounds, <i>g</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. Suppose you're forced to bet on whether <i>q</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is true. You know <i>q</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is a logical consequence of <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> and not a logical consequence of <i>g</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. If the gain to be had for betting on <i>q</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is low enough and the loss you'd incur if ~<i>q</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is great enough, it seems that the rational person's betting preferences might be determined by <i>g</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, but not <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. (Conditional on <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, the rational thing to do is bet on <i>q</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> and then collect your tiny winnings. Conditional on <i>g</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, the rational thing is to avoid the risk of a major loss for a nearly trivial gain.) If it's not rational to treat <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as a reason in this case (which it isn't), KJ seems to imply that <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> really isn't known.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Fantl and McGrath's response is clever (226). They think they can respond to this argument against KJ, a version of the argument from hypothetical gambles, in roughly the way that Sorensen (1988) responds to Kripke's dogmatism paradox. Suppose you know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. You know, then, that if any evidence against <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> surfaces, it is misleading. So, can you properly disregard any evidence against <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> if any surfaces? It seems not. Sorensen's suggestion: <i>when</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> the evidence against <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> surfaces, you lose your knowledge of <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> and your basis for accepting the conditional that if any evidence against <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> emerges it is misleading (the conditional is 'junk knowledge'). So, you can't properly disregard the evidence, but that's not because you don't know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> in situations where the evidence against it hasn't surfaced. Applied to hypothetical gambles, KJ says that if <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is known, it can be put to work, and that seems to justify a policy of betting as if <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> rather than just betting as if <i>g</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. However, to say that <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is known now, it doesn't follow that the knowledge is retained in a betting situation. If you know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, you know the conditional: if offered the appropriate gamble, it would be best to take it. However, your knowledge of the conditional is junk knowledge. If you know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, you do know the conditional, but knowledge of that conditional does not justify the conditional preference that would lead to reckless betting behavior. In being offered the bet, Fantl and McGrath say, you lose the knowledge that <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> and so lose whatever justification you had for adopting a reckless betting policy premised on <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> rather than <i>g</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. For this response to work, we have to think that changing the stakes is the sort of thing that leads to a loss of knowledge. Here the dialectic gets complicated. The threat that evidence against <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> poses to knowledge that <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is obvious. Is raising the stakes, like introducing new evidence, a threat to knowledge? If you thought that KJ and impurism about knowledge were antecedently well motivated, this might be a satisfying response. If you were not already committed to KJ and impurism, the response is less satisfying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-AU">(ii) Epistemic and Practical Justification<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In the course of arguing from impurism about knowledge to impurism about justification, Fantl and McGrath argue that we don't need to know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> to have sufficient warrant to treat <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as a reason for action or belief; we only need knowledge-level justification. According to KJ, if you know <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is warranted enough to justify belief and action. Holding fixed knowledge-level justification and subtracting truth and being unGettiered from knowledge makes no difference as to whether <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is warranted enough to justify belief and action. Thus JJ is true: if <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is knowledge-level justified (or, simply, justified), <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is warranted enough to justify. The view deviates from a view defended by Hawthorne and Stanley on which knowledge is needed to properly treat something as a reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">I think Fantl and McGrath are right that the Gettier conditions don't matter, but what about the truth-requirement? If you accept JJ on the basis of the subtraction argument, you have to say that falsehoods can justify. Coop orders two gin and tonics, one for Audrey and one for himself. He's given one gin and tonic and one petrol and tonic. He hands Audrey the petrol and tonic. She drinks. She becomes violently ill. This date is not going well. While Coop might have nearly killed Audrey, can he justify giving her the toxic stuff? He can <i>try</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, of course, but can he succeed? Here's what Fantl and McGrath say: <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">Notice if we asked the unlucky fellow why he did such a thing, he might reply with indignation: 'Well, it was the perfectly rational thing to do; I had every reason to think the glass contained gin; why in the world should I think that someone would be going around putting petrol in the cocktail glasses!?' Here the unlucky subject, in our view, is not providing an excuse for his action . . . ; he is <i>defending it</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as the action that made the most sense for him to do and the proposition that made most sense to treat as a reason. He is providing a justification, not an excuse (125).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Myself, I think this is a mistake -- we excuse wrongful actions by showing that the agent was nevertheless perfectly reasonable for having performed them. If the thing wasn't reasonable for the agent to do, what excuse could there possibly be?<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Let's bracket that for now and look at how they describe the case. On their view: <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">(1) What justified Coop in giving Audrey the toxic stuff was that there was gin and tonic in that glass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Why say that? Perhaps because we think because Coop was justified in acting and justified in treating <i>that there was gin and tonic in that glass </i></span><span lang="EN-AU">as a reason for acting. So, you might think that JJ commits us to saying it. They deny that (1) entails that there was gin and tonic in that glass and suggest that a parenthetical remark cancels whatever implication suggests that (1) is true only if there was gin in the glass:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">(2) What justified Coop in giving Audrey the toxic stuff was that there was gin and tonic in that glass, as he thought at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">I <i>don't</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> think this parenthetical remark cancels the implication. So, I'm with those writers who think that ascriptions of normative reasons are factive.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup> Part of the reason is that it seems that (1) entails (3):<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">(3) Coop was justified in giving Audrey the toxic stuff (in part) because there was gin in the glass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">If (1) entails (3), (1) cannot be true if there was no gin in the glass because '<i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> because <i>q</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">' is factive. (It cannot be that '<i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> because <i>q</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">' is true unless '<i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> and <i>q</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">' is true.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The linguistic intuitions that convince me that (2) does not cancel the implication that there was gin in the glass and that convince me that (1) entails (3) tend to point towards views I like. I don't know if my views or intuitions are my cart or my horse. Bracket the linguistic considerations. Notice that one thing that justifying or normative reasons are supposed to do is show that something is favorable. Favorers, I take it, can explain what makes something favorable or attractive. So, if in describing the justifying reasons that justified some S's </span>Φ<span style="font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-AU"><span style=""></span></span><span lang="EN-AU">-ing, I take it that in saying that <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> was a normative reason for S to </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU">, I am committing myself to further 'because' claims such as '</span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU">-ing had something going for it because <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">'. Such a claim is true only if the explanans proposition is true, so it seems we have further evidence that ascriptions of normative reasons are factive. One way to deal with this worry is to deny that you can subtract truth from knowledge-level justification. If we can make an intuitive case for JJ without building in any substantive assumptions about what the correct account of justification should look like, perhaps we should use JJ to argue from the falsity of (1) against the commonly held view that there can be justified, false beliefs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Here is a second concern. JJ can be read it in two ways. On the first reading, it is all about the epistemic: if you justifiably believe <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, there is nothing epistemically improper in treating <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as a reason for belief or for action (JJ-). On the second, it's not all about the epistemic: if you justifiably believe <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, there is nothing epistemically or <i>practically</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> improper in treating <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as a reason for belief or for action (JJ+).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup> In some places, Fantl and McGrath speak as if they think that justifiably believing <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> means <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> justifies acting. Given that they take justifying to amount to something like obliging, mandating, or requiring, it seems they are committed to the claim that if S justifiably believes <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> knowing that </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU">-ing is best iff <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, the subject is required to </span>Φ<span style="font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-AU"><span style=""></span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> if she justifiably believes <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">. In other places, they express reservations about JJ+ and so might avoid the difficulties here by opting for JJ-. I think it would be wise for them to deny JJ+.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Suppose that in w1, Audrey sees an infant and a kitten in trouble. She knows infants matter more than kittens and so she believes that it's better to save the infant. She knows she can save the infant. She deduces and justifiably believes she ought to save the infant from the premises that this is the best and this is something she can do. What should she do? JJ- doesn't say. JJ+ says that she ought to save the infant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU"><i><span style=""> </span></i></span><span lang="EN-AU">In w2, Audrey is in the same non-factive mental states as she is in w1. Suppose this means that the same beliefs are justified for her. She reasons just as she does in w1 does and so reasons from the justified belief that it would be better to save the infant and the justified belief that she can save the infant to the justified belief that she must save the infant. If her justifying reasons include <i>that she must save the infant</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, JJ- justifies her in <i>believing</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> things like <i>that she must do what she takes to be necessary for saving the infant. </i></span><span lang="EN-AU">JJ+ says that she ought to save the infant. Apart from describing Audrey's non-factive mental states, I've not said anything about what's happening in w2. Suppose she can't save the infant. According to 'ought' implies 'can', it's false that she ought to save the infant. If JJ+ implies that it would be true that she ought to save the infant if she ought to believe she ought to save the infant, it's false that she ought to believe she ought to save the infant. And, if that's false, it's either false that she ought to believe that it's best to save the infant or false that she ought to believe she can. And, if we say that what someone ought to believe supervenes upon this subject's non-factive mental states, it's false to say in w1 that Audrey ought to believe she ought to save the infant. In turn, it's either false to say in w1 that she ought to believe she can or to say in w1 that she ought to believe that's best. And that's crazy. JJ+ forces us to choose between OIC and what is starting to look like a rather skeptical view: you mustn't believe both that you can </span>Φ<span style="font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-AU"><span style=""></span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> and it's best to </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU"> unless both would be true in every possible world involving a mental duplicate of yours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">If Fantl and McGrath deny JJ+ and stick with JJ-, this takes care of the problem. If we're to make sense of this sort of view, we have to understand how it's possible for there to be something that you (epistemically) ought to believe to be a reason (e.g., that I must </span>Φ<span lang="EN-AU">) that (epistemically) ought to figure in deliberation that (practically) you oughtn't let lead you to </span>Φ<span style="font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-AU"><span style=""></span></span><span lang="EN-AU">. We would have to distinguish between the conditions that determine whether <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is a normative reason in the sense that it is something that goes towards determining what an agent ought (practically) to do and the conditions that determine whether the subject is (epistemically) justified in going on believing, settling deliberation, and acting as if <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is a normative reason. In turn, we have to deny that justifiably believing <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> and justifiably treating <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> as if it is a normative reason entails that <i>p</i></span><span lang="EN-AU"> is a genuine normative reason. If this distinction makes any sense, they can put it to work to deal with the problem that arose for JJ+ and the problem of false justifying reasons.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[7]</span></span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU"><i>References:<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Derose, K. 1992.

While I'm not in favor of blaming lunatics for what they do, this ignores the work of those writers who think that there are many ways of removing blame. Excuses are often distinguished from denials of responsibility or exemptions. Both involve removing blame, but they do it in different ways -- one shows that the failure to act on the stronger reason does not call into question the assumption that the agent is responsible and reasonable and the other calls into question the assumption that we're dealing with the work of a responsible, reasonable agent. The question as to whether cases of ignorance and mistaken belief are properly classified as cases where excuses are appropriate is a difficult one.
