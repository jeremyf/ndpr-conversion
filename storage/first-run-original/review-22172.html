	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Michaël de Saint Cheron's <i style="">Conversations with Emmanuel Levinas, 1983-1994 </i>(hereafter <i style="">Conversations</i>), is a somewhat misleadingly titled new publication from Duquesne University Press. The  book's title makes it sound as though it is a collection of interviews between  Levinas and Saint Cheron, a scholar who has published works on Augustin Malroux  and Elie Wiesel and who participated in Levinas's lessons at the École  normal israélite orientale from 1983 onward. However, Saint Cheron's interviews  compose only a small part of the book, which also contains four essays on  Levinas and an extended essay on Yom Kippur, atonement, and forgiveness. The fact  that these interviews constitute a small part of the book will be a  disappointment for some. However, <i style="">Conversations </i>has several qualities to recommend it, both as a study of Levinas's  philosophy as well as a work of Jewish philosophy in its own right.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Let me get my main criticism of this book out of  the way. My main concern has less to do with its content -- with any of Saint  Cheron's arguments or interpretive theses about Levinas's philosophy -- and more  with how its content is presented. The book's title makes it sound as though  it is a collection of interviews, one akin to Jennifer Robbins's <i style="">Is  It Righteous to Be?</i>, with a special focus on interviews conducted in the last decade of Levinas's life. In fact, Saint Cheron's interviews make up only a small part of the book, roughly its first  twenty-five pages, starting on page thirteen and ending on page thirty-eight.<b style=""> </b>This will disappoint some readers. It has become a cliché to call attention to the obscurity of Levinas's  prose, but the fact remains that his writings are extremely challenging. He was often  more direct in interviews, and they have become an invaluable tool for disambiguating claims he makes in works such as <i style="">Totality and  Infinity</i> and <i style="">Otherwise than Being</i>.<b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Perhaps more importantly, Levinas allowed  himself more latitude in interviews to discuss a wider array of topics. Simon  Critchley has described Levinas as a thinker with a single "big idea," the relation to the other, which he returns to time and time again in his philosophic  works.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> This is not to say that his writings are monotonous, but there is a single-mindedness to them, so that we see him reiterating time and time  again how the relation to the other cannot be fully comprehended but find  relatively little discussion about how his conception of responsibility bears on issues in normative ethics. He allowed himself more freedom in interviews to  comment on political events and to speculate about issues in normative ethics.  Thus, for example, publications on his views concerning the moral standing of  nonhuman nature have come to rely heavily on remarks he makes in interviews, particularly his 1986 interview "The Paradox of Morality," to assess whether his understanding of responsibility is consistent with a robust  account of animal rights.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">One could argue that the reference to "conversations" in the book's title should be interpreted more figuratively, as referring not only to the interviews in Part One but to  the scholarly engagements with Levinas's philosophy in Part Two and to his discussion of Yom Kippur and forgiveness in Part Three, which might be characterized as an homage to Levinas's "Toward the Other." But this justification is unsatisfying. There is relatively little discussion  about Levinas in the book's third section, which is by far its longest.  Levinas is referenced by my count seven times in this section, which spans  approximately forty-eight pages, and is only quoted in passing. His extensive  meditation on Yom Kippur, atonement, and forgiveness in "Toward the Other" is mentioned but never receives anything like a thorough, sustained  analysis. Instead, Saint Cheron develops his own observations about the  distinctive attitudes toward atonement and forgiveness in Jewish thought. Moreover,  the reference in the book's title to the years in which he conducted his  interviews encourages readers to think that the book will be a collection of them.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Again, this criticism is not directed at the  book's content, which, as I explain below, has much to recommend it. Nor do I  mean to suggest that the publisher, Duquesne Press, is to blame for misleading  readers, for the title is simply a translation of the most recent French work on  which it is based (<i style="">Entretiens avec Emmanuel Levinas, 1983-1994</i>). Nonetheless, I think it's important to  emphasize that <i style="">Conversations </i>is not a collection of interviews, given the significant role they have come to play in English  language scholarship on him.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Having presented my main concern, I turn to  identifying some of the qualities of the book that make it valuable. It will not be possible to summarize the entirety of its contents, given the variety of  topics that are discussed in the interviews, the range of interpretative theses  about Levinas's philosophy that Saint Cheron explores in the second section,  and the variety of points he makes about Yom Kippur, atonement, and forgiveness  in the final section. Instead, I will focus on identifying just a few qualities  that distinguish <i style="">Conversations </i>as a work of Levinas scholarship. I would note in passing, though, that two of the  essays in its second section engage in comparative studies that may be of  special interest to some scholars -- those interested in Levinas's similarities  to Sartre and Malraux. Also, my comments in what follows focus on the  book's value as a work of Levinas scholarship, but it should be noted that the final  part develops provocative suggestions about the distinctive ways in which  forgiveness is treated in Jewish thought and about the challenges Jews face with  respect to forgiveness after the Holocaust. Saint Cheron's book may be of interest  more generally to scholars working in Jewish philosophy.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Saint Cheron is known in the French academic  community for his publications on and interviews with Elie Wiesel. This background  is evident in <i style="">Conversations</i>. To a greater degree than other commentators, Saint Cheron is sensitive to the  ways in which Levinas's experience of the Holocaust shaped his philosophy, particularly his experience of survivor-hood. Saint Cheron is not the  only commentator to point out how traces of survivor's guilt can be found in Levinas's writings, such as in his repeated insistence that the question  raised by death is not, as Hamlet proposed, "To be or not to be?" but "Is it righteous to be?" Levinas here depicts merely existing as something that may be morally culpable, as if by existing we robbed  others of their places in the world. Others have suggested that traces of  survivor's guilt can be seen in this characterization of death. However, Saint  Cheron is especially skilled at establishing this connection between Levinas's  philosophy and his experience of the Holocaust and survivor-hood. Consider, for  example, how Levinas explains his perspective on death in one of Saint Cheron's interviews:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">EL: In the sadness  caused by someone's death there's something like the feeling of responsibility for  this life that has come to an end and in that sense a feeling similar to  guilt, as if we were guilty for surviving, as if there were guilt in innocence . .  . when you say death is scandalous, it means that the "survivor" cannot simply and purely wash his hands of the affair. Humanity shares a part  of all that's bad in the world. (27)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">More than other commentators, then, Saint Cheron  is attuned to moments in Levinas's philosophy when he seems to be  meditating on his own relationship to the Holocaust in the course of developing his philosophic claims. Let me give another example. Many commentators have  noted how Levinas begins <i style="">Otherwise than Being</i> with a dedication to "those closest among the six million assassinated  by the National Socialists," followed by the names, in Hebrew, of those members of his family who were murdered in the Holocaust. Several have suggested that this dedication is telling -- that it reveals something  about his philosophic project in <i style="">Otherwise than Being</i>. Saint Cheron goes farther than others, though, in uncovering  links between Levinas's theses in <i style="">Otherwise than Being</i> and this dedication. He suggests at one point that the "otherwise than being" in the book's title refers to the six million deaths Levinas mentions in his dedication:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The entire  philosophy of <i style="">Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence</i> begins here [with Levinas's dedication]. How to philosophize out of this  gaping hole, this abyss that left Martin Heidegger cold? Does this "otherwise than being" refer in truth to an otherwise than dying, the very dying  that is in question in the preliminary epigraph? In other words, what  relation can be discerned between these two modalities and dying? (44)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This suggestion, while poignant, could be  considered controversial given that there seems to be little textual evidence in <i style="">Otherwise than Being</i> to suggest Levinas is referring to the Holocaust when he attempts to philosophize about  what is "otherwise than being." Instead, it is customary to read him as attempting to show how the relation to the other cannot be analyzed in  terms of being or non-being, hence how this relation subverts some of our  traditional beliefs about knowledge, language, and time. Yet Saint Cheron skillfully  shows how Levinas uses the same terminology when discussing death -- how he repeatedly insists that it is not the opposite or the negation of being, not-being or not-existing, but a "mystery" that cannot be analyzed in ontological terms. On the basis of such remarks, Saint Cheron builds a convincing argument for his interpretation of <i style="">Otherwise than  Being</i>.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Saint Cheron's own interest, then, in the  Holocaust and in figures such as Wiesel and Malraux leads him to emphasize certain  themes in his essays on Levinas: death, survivor-hood, holiness, the Holocaust and post-Holocaust Jewish life. He is also uniquely attuned to those moments  in Levinas's writings when Levinas seems to be concerned to address the  great moral crises of the last century, particularly the Holocaust. What  emerges in his essays is a more dynamic interpretation of Levinas -- one that  approaches his philosophy as an engaged dialogue with history.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">His interviews with Levinas are fascinating for  similar reasons. As I noted above, Saint Cheron emphasizes the importance of  Levinas's ideas about death, survivor-hood, the Holocaust, and holiness in his  essays on Levinas. He is also skilled at prompting Levinas to reflect on these  issues in his interviews. More generally, he has a gift for encouraging Levinas to  apply his ideas to historic events. The translator of <i style="">Conversations</i>,  Gary D. Mole, rightly admits in his foreword that "readers familiar with Levinas may not be treated to any startlingly new revelations" in Saint Cheron's interviews (x). Nonetheless, he is also right in suggesting that these interviews are interesting because one  sees Levinas applying his ideas to historic events that were occurring when  the interviews were being conducted, and one does encounter some surprising  moments in them.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Consider, for example, this question which Saint  Cheron poses to Levinas:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Q: Auschwitz,  Hiroshima, the Stalinist regime: for you, who witnessed these three central events  unfold in our terrible twentieth century, what lesson has been there for your  thought? (21)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Levinas refers to these events in several  writings and often depicts them as initiating a transformation in our ethical  sensibilities. Thus he writes in "Useless Suffering" that "Hitlerism and Stalinism, Hiroshima, the Gulag, and the genocides of Auschwitz and Cambodia" mark an "end to theodicy" and impose an obligation on humanity to deny ourselves any further indifference to "useless suffering."<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup>  I had expected him to reiterate this point in response to Saint Cheron's  question. Yet here is his answer:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">E.L.: That secular  messianic ideas are no longer possible because people thought that these events  announced the end of history. (21)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This reply is unexpected, but it helps to keep  in mind the intellectual climate of the early nineties. Saint Cheron's  interviews were conducted while the Soviet Union was collapsing, when the reunification  of Germany was a recent memory, and when there was much talk in academia  about how such events marked "the end of history." Levinas references these discussions several times in Saint Cheron's interviews:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">E.L.: What's  dramatic is that the end of Communism is the temptation of a time that has lost its  orientation. We've become so used to considering time as going somewhere, whether  it's waiting for the Messiah, waiting for Christ to return, or the movement  toward a just society. Since Marx, this wasn't what Soviet Russia represented for  everybody, but for a part of humanity in any case, the collapse of Communism can be  felt as the end of history. Which is why what happened in Russia should not  be taken lightly. We have suddenly entered a time that's going nowhere. Either  it's good or it's bad, since nothing has meaning anymore. (20)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">To my knowledge, this is one of the few places  where Levinas engages with the debates over the end of history that were  popular in the early nineties.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Despite my reservations, then, about this book's  title, there is much to recommend <i style="">Conversations with Emmanuel Levinas, 1983-1994</i> as a work of Levinas scholarship.  Saint Cheron's interviews with Levinas, although brief, have all the qualities  that make them such valuable resources: Levinas is considerably clearer in  them in presenting his ideas and allows himself more freedom to reflect on the implications of his philosophy for other areas of study. They are also fascinating because of what they reveal about his perspective on the intellectual debates and historic events that took place toward the end  of his life. Finally, Saint Cheron's own interest in death, survivor-hood, and holiness, and of how Levinas's experience of Holocaust shaped his  thinking on these issues, leads him to develop an interesting approach to Levinas's philosophy. To a greater degree than other commentators, Saint Cheron is concerned to present Levinas's philosophy as emerging in response to the  great moral crises of the twentieth century. Finally, although I have not  discussed the last part of his book in this review, Saint Cheron's extended  meditation on Yom Kippur, atonement, and forgiveness, and on the challenges Jews face  in dealing with issues of forgiveness after the Holocaust, has much to  recommend it as an independent work of Jewish philosophy in its own right.</p>    <div style="">
