	<p class="MsoBodyText">Peter Carruthers' latest book on consciousness is a collection of essays; all but two had been previously published (within the past decade).<span style="">  </span>The book consists of twelve chapters, while the content can be divided into three major themes.<span style="">  </span>Chapters 2-6 delineate and defend Carruthers' own theory of consciousness, which he categorizes as a <i>dispositional higher-order thought [HOT] theory</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>He argues that this theory can bridge the notorious </span><i>explanatory gap</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">   </span>Chapters 7-8 examine the connection between language and conscious thinking, and argue that language is </span><i>constitutive</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of our thought.<span style="">  </span>Finally, chapters 9-12 venture into the world of non-human animals to discuss, while these animals do not have </span><i>phenomenal</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> consciousness, what kind of mentality we can attribute to them and what our moral attitude toward them should be.<span style="">  </span>The book is written in a clear and rigorous manner, but at times it can be a bit too technical to follow.<span style="">  </span>It is not a book for beginners, but it is worth reading for anyone who wishes to understand current philosophical debates on the nature of consciousness; in particular, to see Caruthers' own theory laid out on the map of theories of consciousness.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Dispositional HOT Theory<o:p></o:p></b></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">A preliminary clarification of Carruthers' theory of consciousness is that his subject matter is conscious mental <i>states</i><span style="font-style: normal;">; in particular, </span><i>phenomenal</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> conscious states.<span style="">  </span>As Carruthers defines it, "[m]ental states are phenomenally conscious when it is </span><i>like</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> something to undergo them, when they have a distinctive subjective aspect, or when they have </span><i>feel</i><span style="font-style: normal;">" (p. 3).<span style="">  </span>It is this kind of consciousness, rather than </span><i>access</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> consciousness, that is regarded by those like David Chalmers as posing the "hard problem."<span style="">  </span>It is this kind of consciousness that is regarded by folks like Joseph Levine as producing an "explanatory gap" in our theories of consciousness.<span style="">  </span>It is also this kind of consciousness that is conceded by everyone (even by a staunch reductionist such as Jaegwon Kim) to be </span><i>non-reducible</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to physicalistic properties or explanations.<span style="">  </span>Now Carruthers tells us: not to worry.<span style="">  </span>The hard problem "isn't really </span><i>so</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>very</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> hard after all" (p. 60).<span style="">  </span>We </span><i>could </i><span style="font-style: normal;">solve the problem of phenomenal consciousness; we </span><i>could</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> reduce phenomenal consciousness to naturalistic properties, and we </span><i>can</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> explain phenomenal consciousness in functional/intentional terms.<span style="">  </span><b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Carruthers' starting point is functionalism.<span style="">  </span>The choice between functionalism and some form of identity theory inclines philosophers to place more confidence either in cognitive sciences or in neurosciences.<span style="">  </span>Under the functionalist view of consciousness, phenomenal consciousness is not necessarily a biological phenomenon.<span style="">  </span>Phenomenal consciousness can be explained, not by identifying its physical correlates in the brain, but by locating its causal/functional roles.<span style="">  </span>A <i>reductive</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> explanation of phenomenal consciousness </span><i>could</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> be given, according to Carruthers, if we first construe phenomenally conscious properties in terms of a "third-personal characterization."<span style="">  </span>This third-personal characterization renders the concept of </span><i>phenomenal consciousness</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> relational and non-intrinsic, specifiable in terms of a functional/causal role in the agent's introspection, reasoning, and possibly action schemata.<span style="">  </span>Carruthers calls mental phenomena picked out by the third-personal characterization "the </span><i>thickly</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> individuated facts," and those picked out by the first-personal recognition "the </span><i>thinly</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> individuated facts" (pp. 30 ff.).<span style="">  </span>He argues that reductive explanation should target the former, not the latter; furthermore, a reductive explanation can be successfully given for phenomenal consciousness characterized third-personally.<span style="">  </span>Hence, the explanatory gap </span><i>could</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> be closed as long as we choose our </span><i>explanandum</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> correctly.<span style="">     </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The functional role of phenomenal consciousness, as Carruthers sees it, is to provide some sort of intentional content that would be "available to a faculty of higher-order thought (HOT)" (p. 8).<span style="">  </span>The "higher-order thought" here refers to the agent's cognitive, conceptual, or perceptual representation of his or her own mental states.<span style="">  </span>Carruthers thinks that it is this higher-order thought that gives the agent's mental states a subjective <i>feel</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>By having a higher-order representation of one's mental state, one is not only experiencing "</span><i>what the world is like</i><span style="font-style: normal;">," but also </span><i>what one's </i><span style="font-style: normal;">"</span><i>experience of the world is like</i><span style="font-style: normal;">" (p. 43).<span style="">  </span>This demand on a higher-order representation separates all higher-order theories from the first-order representational (FOR) theories advocated, in particular, by Fred Dretske and Michael Tye.<span style="">  </span>In Carruthers' construction of our cognitive architecture, we have a judgment of, say, </span><i>this redness</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, accompanied by our judgment of </span><i>this experience of red</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>The former is a judgment about worldly redness, while the latter is about our own experiences.<span style="">  </span>Many creatures can have the first kind of judgment; only we (and possibly other intelligent primates) can have the second kind of judgment.<span style="">  </span>According to Carruthers, it is this second kind of judgment that gives our phenomenally conscious states a </span><i>subjective feel</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Through this HOT, "conscious experiences don't just present the world (or our own bodies) to us, but also somehow present themselves to us" (p. 137).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">By "being available," Carruthers does not mean that the higher-order thought must be "actually" occurrent.<span style="">  </span>The "availability" condition means that the intentional content is either actually targeted by a higher-order thought at the time, or would have been so targeted if, for example, the agent had been paying the right sorts of attention.<span style="">  </span>This condition distinguishes his theory from the <i>actualist</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> HOT theory, which he attributes to David Rosenthal.<span style="">  </span>The difference between the dispositional theory and the actualist theory can be seen in Armstrong's example of the absent-minded truck driver, who would </span><i>not </i><span style="font-style: normal;">be phenomenally conscious under the actualist theory, but </span><i>could be</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;">-conscious under the dispositional theory.<span style="">  </span>Carruthers argues that the </span><i>actualist</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> theory will face the problem of </span><i>cognitive overload</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (p. 54), because at any given moment, we would be receiving an immense amount of perceptual inputs, and it is hard to believe that we could be representing all of them on a higher-order cognitive level.<span style="">  </span>On the </span><i>dispositional</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> theory, on the other hand, the intentional representations are stored in short-term memory such that they are </span><i>poised</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, available for use.<span style="">  </span>Even in the absence of a single (actual) HOT, the subject can be phenomenally conscious of the content of her mental state "provided that the subject remains </span><i>capable</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of entertaining HOTs about any aspect of its contents" (p. 55).<span style="">    </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Carruthers thinks that our higher-order representations of our own mental states are primarily operative in a cognitive mode, not generated by some sort of <i>inner sense</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>He argues that "the representations in question would need to be able to ground judgments of </span><i>appearance</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, or of </span><i>seeming</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, helping the organism to negotiate the distinction between appearance and reality" (p. 51).<span style="">  </span>This specification of </span><i>cognitive representation</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of one's own mental states is what distinguishes HOT theories from other forms of higher-order theories, in particular, William Lycan's higher-order experience (HOE) theory.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In summary, for Carruthers our phenomenally conscious states have two contents: the lower-order representation of the world or of our body and the higher-order representation of our experience of the world or of our body.<span style="">  </span>These experiences "become both world-representing (e.g., with the analog content <i>red</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) and experience-representing (e.g., with the analog content </span><i>seems red</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> or </span><i>experience of red</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) at the same time" (p. 107).<span style="">  </span>It is one and the same set of states that have both these contents; for this reason, Carruthers also calls his theory </span><i>the dual-content</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> theory (p. 64).<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Thought and Language<o:p></o:p></b></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">"Phenomenal consciousness" applies to our perceptual states.<span style="">  </span>When it comes to conscious thinking which does not have the phenomenal <i>feel</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, Carruthers posits a mental faculty, which he calls a "mind-reading" faculty.<span style="">  </span>He argues that "conscious thinking requires immediate, non-inferential, non-interpretative access to our own occurrent thoughts" (p. 117).<span style="">  </span>As with first-order perceptual states, here it is also the higher-order thought that makes the first-order thought </span><i>conscious</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Carruthers says, "a conscious thought will be one that is available to thoughts about the occurrence of that thought" (p. 123).<span style="">  </span>Examples of higher-order awareness of one's own thought are "I am currently thinking that </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;">" or "I am currently desiring that </span><i>Q</i><span style="font-style: normal;">," etc.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Carruthers adopts what he calls the <i>cognitive </i><span style="font-style: normal;">conception of language. <span style=""> </span>Under this conception, language is </span><i>constitutive</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of (some forms of) thought because we conduct our conscious propositional thinking in natural language.<span style="">  </span>If our </span><i>inner speech</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> were not the same as the natural language we use, then we would need interpretation of our own thought.<span style="">  </span>In that case, our higher-order access to our occurrent thought would not be immediate and non-inferential, and our occurrent thought would therefore be </span><i>unconscious</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Hence, continues Carruthers' argument, if we want to acknowledge that we </span><i>do</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> employ conscious propositional thinking, then our inner speech must consist in our natural language.<span style="">  </span><span style="color:red;"><span style=""> </span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Animal Consciousness and Animal Mentality<o:p></o:p></b></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">If what defines 'phenomenal consciousness' is a higher-order thought, then non-linguistic animals do <i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> have phenomenal consciousness.<span style="">  </span>As Carruthers claims, "I conclude that higher-order representation theories will entail . . . that very few animals besides ourselves are subject to phenomenally conscious mental states" (p. 51).<span style="">  </span>Does this imply that these animals are not sentient, not minded, unaware of suffering and do not deserve our sympathy?<span style="">  </span>Of course not, Carruthers argues.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In Chapters 9 to 10, Carruthers makes the following claims: (1) Even if non-human animals are not <i>conscious</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of their experiences, they can still suffer from other forms of mental harm such as disappointment, frustration or thwarted desire, and thus can still deserve our sympathy.<span style="">  </span>(2) Even though phenomenal consciousness requires higher-order thought, non-conscious creatures can and do suffer on the first-order level.<span style="">  </span>They can perceive pain and find it to be </span><i>awful</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, for example, even though they do not perceive their own perception of the pain.<span style="">  </span>As Carruthers puts it, "So there seems nothing to prevent animals from finding their pains awful, even if their pain experiences aren't phenomenally conscious ones" (p. 186).<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In Chapters 11 and 12, Carruthers argues that non-human animals' lacking phenomenal consciousness <i>does not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> matter in their cognitive architecture, since they do have a mind as well as many mental functions that we possess. In the two figures (11.1 and 11.2) on pages 201-2, one depicting a mind with a dual-visual system and lacking a HOT faculty while the other depicts the mind with a HOT faculty, the two functional flows are basically the same, with the exception of the latter's having an extra box for the HOT faculty.<span style="">  </span>The extra function does not seem to play any significant role in the core architecture of the </span><i>mind</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, not to mention in the initiation of action.<span style="">  </span>As a result, it matters little in our explanation of the action/behavior of non-human animals that they do not have phenomenal consciousness.<span style="">  </span>Carruthers concludes that his theory and its implications on animals will have very little significance for comparative psychology.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Carruthers is attempting an ambitious project by locating the elusive phenomenal consciousness in the causal/representational architecture of the mind.<span style="">  </span>However, his characterization of phenomenal consciousness seems to waver between two conceptions: one is to render it functional and playing a certain causal role; the other is to render it almost epiphenomenal and explanatorily irrelevant.<span style="">  </span>Under the first characterization, phenomenal consciousness is given a functional/causal role by virtue of its intentional content.<span style="">  </span>The higher-order thought represents the lower-order perceptual states stored in short-term memory to the agent, and the agent thereby has a phenomenally conscious state.<span style="">  </span>In this respect, Carruthers's <i>phenomenal</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> consciousness is very closely related to </span><i>access</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> consciousness.<span style="">  </span>Carruthers is committed to the (logical) possibility that there might be phenomenally conscious events that "aren't access conscious (that aren't available for reporting in speech or to figure in decision-making)" (p. 77).<span style="">  </span>However, he does not think such a possibility is </span><i>real</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, because "within our experience and to the best of our belief these two properties are always co-instantiated" (</span><i>ibid</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.).<span style="">   </span>When standing alone, phenomenal consciousness does not seem to enter into the causation of action, nor is it usually relevant to our explanation of behavior.<span style="">  </span>One cannot help wondering: what is the cognitive function of phenomenal consciousness after all?<span style="">  </span>As Carruthers acknowledges, "The fact that those perceptual states also happen to be phenomenally conscious ones in the case of humans will be irrelevant to the explanation" (p. 202).<span style="">  </span>The only situation where phenomenal consciousness is explanatorily relevant is when we try to explain how we humans "draw a distinction between the way things </span><i>are</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and the way they </span><i>seem </i><span style="font-style: normal;">or</span><i> appear</i><span style="font-style: normal;">" and our actions depend on such distinctions (p. 204).<span style="">  </span>This implies that unless we are in </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>skeptical mode</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> or we are scrupulously self-reflective, our phenomenal consciousness </span><i>is </i><span style="font-style: normal;">epiphenomenal.<span style="">  </span>In that case, why don't we utilize Occam's Razor on this theoretical posit of phenomenal consciousness?</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Carruthers takes it to be an advantage of his theory that the so-called <i>qualia</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, those </span><i>intrinsic</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>non-relational</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>ineffable</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>private</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> qualities of experience are </span><i>explained away</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>In their stead, however, he introduces </span><i>purely recognitional concepts</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. A concept is purely recognitional, as Carruthers defines it, "when nothing in the grasp of that concept, as such, requires its user to apply or appeal to any other concept or belief" (p. 83).<span style="">  </span>In other words, the subject has a direct acquaintance with, or an indexical reference to, what is captured by the concept.<span style="">  </span>According to Carruthers, there are two levels of purely recognitional concepts -- one recognizing features of the world (e.g., </span><i>this red</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) while the other recognizing our experiences of these features (</span><i>this experience of red</i><span style="font-style: normal;">).<span style="">  </span>Both kinds of concepts "will have no conceptual connections with any of our physical, causal-role, or intentional-content concepts -- not even with the concept </span><i>experience</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, if this is functionally specified by the characteristic place of experiences in the causal architecture of cognition" (p. 81).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Carruthers argues, "from the fact that we have <i>concepts</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of phenomenally conscious states that lack any conceptual connections with physical, functional, or intentional concepts, it of course doesn't follow that the </span><i>properties</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that our purely recognitional concepts pick out aren't physical, functional, or intentional ones" (p. 68).<span style="">  </span>However, "concepts" and "properties" cannot be so readily separated.<span style="">  </span>The "</span><i>this</i><span style="font-style: normal;">" in our concepts picks out the properties </span><i>we experience</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> but could not express, nor communicate, in any other way (hence, </span><i>ineffable</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>private</i><span style="font-style: normal;">).<span style="">  </span>Therefore, purely recognitional concepts designate first-person experiential properties, which defy reductive explanation.<span style="">  </span>The explanatory gap is not closed; it is simply pushed to a different corner.<span style="">  </span>In the end, even if we can have a reductive explanation for higher-order thought, we do not have any reductive explanation for purely recognitional concepts or the properties they "recognize."<span style="">  </span>There is still a huge explanatory gap between a functionalistic characterization of consciousness and purely recognitional concepts.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Carruthers demonstrates his mastery of knowledge not only of philosophical theories of consciousness, but also of experimental psychology, animal psychology, and cognitive sciences.<span style="">  </span>However, owing to the nature of collected essays, the chapters in this book occasionally repeat the same data or same explanations.<span style="">  </span>Tighter editing could have made this book more concise.<span style="">  </span>Another problem with the book is that Carruthers made constant reference (pp. 9 ff., 56 ff., 64, 76, 93 ff., 106, 110, 136, 144, 201) to the importance of "consumer semantics" to his whole project (he claims that his theory assumes the truth of "some or other form of consumer semantics"), but never gave the theory any clear explanation.<span style="">  </span>Nor did he defend the truth of consumer semantics anywhere in the book, even though he claims that the "acceptance of some or other form of consumer semantics" is one of the necessary ingredients of his own theory (p. 136).<span style="">  </span>The book would have been more complete if it also contained a well-developed chapter on "consumer semantics," as well as a more conclusive explication of the connection between language and thought.<span style="">  </span></p>
