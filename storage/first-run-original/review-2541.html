	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The conviction that it is permissible for an individual to engage in violent self-defensive action against attack is securely entrenched in our ordinary moral thought.<span style="">  </span>Also widely entrenched is the conviction that warfare is permissible, at least in circumstances in which states are under attack.<span style="">  </span>Wars of national-defense are, in fact, the only wars that may be fought without explicit authorisation by the United Nations, as Article 51 of the United Nations Charter makes clear.<span style="">  </span>Furthermore, it is widely thought that these issues are linked: the permissibility of wars of national-defense is reckoned to be a function of, or at least analogous to, the permissibility of personal self-defense.<span style="">  </span>David Rodin remarks, not implausibly, that the notion of national-defense "gains enormous intuitive legitimacy from the analogy with personal self-defense" (p. 107).</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In this book, Rodin subjects these connections to detailed and skilful examination, and concludes that they are insufficiently substantial to do the work that is required of them: for him, there is no usable analogy between personal self-defense and national self-defense.<span style="">  </span>Rodin then goes on to sketch a normative picture of legitimate warfare that would require the creation of a universal state, consisting in, at the very least, "the establishment of a world monopoly of military force together with a minimal judicial mechanism for the resolution of international and internal disputes" (p. 187).<span style="">  </span>Such a minimal universal state would be justified in authorising military action as a means of enforcing international law.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Though I suspect that Rodin underestimates the robustness of the connections between personal self-defense and national-defense, it should be said immediately that his book will be required reading for anyone with a reflective interest in these issues.<span style="">  </span>It is clearly and shrewdly argued throughout, insightful, provocative, and elegantly written. </span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The book falls into two parts.<span style="">  </span>In Part I, Rodin examines the nature of personal self-defense.<span style="">  </span>In Part II, he considers whether the account of personal self-defense that has emerged in Part I can be used to support an account of legitimate warfare.<span style="">  </span>I shall consider these two parts in turn.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Rodin analyses personal self-defense in rights-based terms, using some theoretical apparatus made familiar by the legal theorist Wesley Hohfeld.<span style="">  </span>In Rodin's account, the right to personal self-defense emerges as a liberty, or permission--which is to say, a justification, rather than merely an excuse--to commit homicide in the defense of life (pp. 31, 33).<span style="">  </span>The right of self-defense possesses the in-built limitations of necessity, imminence, and proportionality.<span style="">  </span>In Rodin's Hohfeldian analysis, the right of self-defense is a relational one: it is triggered by certain sorts of disturbance in a normatively charged relationship that holds between the subject of the right (the victim) and the object of the right (the attacker).<span style="">  </span>Most of Rodin's attention in these pages is devoted to an analysis of the conditions that have to be met in order for the victim's self-defensive right to be activated, or alternatively, for the attacker's right to be forfeited.<span style="">  </span>(As Rodin clearly explains, these are simply different sides of the same coin.)<span style="">  </span>This is energy well spent, for one immediate puzzle for the justifiability of self-defensive action is that, at the moment of potentially lethal engagement between the victim and the attacker, the threat between them is entirely symmetrical: either the victim is going to kill the attacker, or the attacker is going to kill the victim.<span style="">  </span>They are, by assumption, locked into a life-and-death struggle.<span style="">  </span>And both, by assumption, ordinarily possess the right to life.<span style="">  </span>But few would wish to say that the right of self-defensive action is enjoyed by the attacker, as well as by the victim.<span style="">  </span>Most think that the right to engage in violent self-defence is asymmetrical; it is a right possessed by the victim, but not by the attacker.<span style="">  </span>It is natural to conclude that the asymmetry between attacker and victim must be some sort of function of the attacker's responsibility for the life-or-death struggle that has arisen between them.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we appeal to merely causal responsibility, however, that asymmetry begins to look distinctly precarious.<span style="">  </span>Though the attacker may be causally responsible for initiating the life-and-death encounter between him and the victim, the victim, no less than the attacker, is causally responsible for helping to maintain the existence of that life-and-death encounter.<span style="">  </span>It is natural to conclude that, in order to maintain the right sort of distance between them, the sort of responsibility holding between the attacker and the victim that we are trying to capture has to be more than merely causal; it must have a thicker character, which more adequately displays the moral asymmetry between them. </span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Rodin argues that what fuels the right of the victim to engage in self-defensive violent action is that the attacker is at fault for attacking the victim.<span style="">  </span>By culpably attacking the victim, the attacker disturbs the normative relationship existing between them, and therefore forfeits his right not to be attacked.<span style="">  </span>But this means, in turn, that certain types of attacker cannot be permissibly counter-attacked.<span style="">  </span>The protected class of attackers include both 'innocent threats' and 'innocent attackers'.<span style="">  </span>Innocent threats are agents whose dangerousness to the victim is not explained by any exercise of agency at all.<span style="">  </span>(The standard example is that of a fat man who is falling through the air towards the victim.)<span style="">  </span>Innocent attackers are attackers whose agency is in some sense compromised or impaired at the time of attack on the victim.<span style="">  </span>Innocent attackers form a fairly diverse class.<span style="">  </span>They include agents who are impaired as a result of hypnosis, ignorance, insanity, infancy, and duress.<span style="">  </span>Due to the impairment of their agency, Rodin holds that these types of attacker do not enjoy a sufficiently robust normative relationship to the victim for them to forfeit their immunity.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Actually, Rodin takes a slightly more nuanced view than this: innocent threats are immune to attack, on his view, but only certain sorts of innocent attackers are also immune to defensive attack.<span style="">  </span>These are the agents whose attitude to the victim does not reflect their psychological dispositions.<span style="">  </span>Other types of innocent attacker--those who are acting under duress, say--are not immune to attack.<span style="">  </span>Given his commitment to the central importance of fault, Rodin struggles a little to draw the appropriate lines between innocent attackers who enjoy immunity and innocent attackers who do not (see pp. 90-99--to his credit, though, he does not attempt to conceal the difficulties).<span style="">  </span>The problem is that the innocent attackers earmarked for defensive attack are clearly not morally responsible for the lethal threat they pose to the victim.<span style="">  </span>What seems to matter to Rodin, when all is said and done, is that the attacker manifests some hostile intentional attitude to the victim in his attack, regardless of whether he is responsible for that attitude.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Now many writers, such as Judith Thomson, take the view that the victim may permissibly attack innocent threats and innocent attackers, as well as culpable attackers.<span style="">  </span>She argues that, although they may not be responsible for their attack, innocent attackers and innocent threats nonetheless lack the right to attack the victim, and may therefore be counter-attacked.<span style="">  </span>Rodin's reply to Thomson is that exactly the same could be said about a stone that is about to fall on top of the victim (pp. 85-6).<span style="">  </span>A stone also lacks the right to attack the victim.<span style="">  </span>And this supposedly leads to an embarrassment for Thomson: her strategy of allowing the conditions under which rights are violated from the conditions under which agency is manifested inadvertently apparently allows stones, and other inanimate objects, to be classified as rights-violators.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I don't think this can be right, however.<span style="">  </span>It's true that falling stones cannot violate the victim's rights.<span style="">  </span>But Rodin would presumably also agree that stones lack the right not to be attacked.<span style="">  </span>If the victim is in a position to destroy a stone hurtling towards him, he may unproblematically do so.<span style="">  </span>Stones have no presence on the rights landscape at all, but innocent attackers and innocent threats possess rights which are retained through the agency-impaired episodes in which they are threatening the victim's life.<span style="">  </span>Yet why should that be?<span style="">  </span>If the lack of responsibility of innocent attackers and innocent threats is supposed to disable the claim that they are capable of violating the victim's right, why doesn't it disable the claim that they themselves possess the right not to be attacked by the victim?<span style="">  </span>To put it another way, if the claim that innocent attackers and innocent threats can violate rights exposes Thomson to the taunt that stones can also violate the victim's rights, then the claim that innocent attackers and innocent threats possess the right not to be attacked by the victim would appear to expose Rodin to the taunt that stones also possess the right not to be attacked by the victim.<span style="">  </span>Rodin is trying to have it both ways, but it isn't clear why the analogy that he has proposed between innocent threats and stones shouldn't be enforced at both levels--both in terms of violating rights, and in terms of retaining rights.<span style="">  </span>Rodin provides a further response (p. 86, and pp. 88-9), according to which the innocent threat is, <i>qua</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> falling object, just like a stone.<span style="">  </span>This '<i>qua</i></span><span lang="EN-GB">-move' proves too much, however, since a fully culpable attacker, <i>qua</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> mobile and potentially deadly material object, may also be just like a stone.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The sensible thing to do here is simply to restrict the constituency of rights-violators to the constituency of individuals who have a general capacity for agency, regardless of whether those individuals are currently exercising that capacity.<span style="">  </span>That approach, which Rodin is tacitly relying upon, is of course also open to Thomson.<span style="">  </span>Once we do that, it also seems possible to point to morally significant differences between victims and innocent attackers and innocent threats.<span style="">  </span>For innocent attackers and threats <i>initiate</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> the attack on the victim, after all, and that is something that moral agents have no business in doing.<span style="">  </span>(This fact about attackers and threats also allows them to be comfortably distinguished from the 'innocent bystander', who inadvertently blocks the victim's escape from the attack, but whom, according to most non-consequentialist writers, including Rodin, is immune from attack.)<span style="">  </span>This 'initiation' criterion is further strengthened by a back-to-front worry in Rodin's characterisation of the appropriate normative relationship between subject and object.<span style="">  </span>Rodin appears to invest all the normative significance in the object's intentional attitudes towards the subject, and in his consciously refraining from violating the subject's rights.<span style="">  </span>That makes it seem as though the value of a rights-respecting relationship between person X and person Y is constituted by X's consciously refraining from interfering with Y, and by Y's consciously refraining from interfering with X.<span style="">  </span>That arguably gets things the wrong way round: why X and Y ought to refrain from consciously interfering with each other's rights is explained by the value of a relationship between them in which their respective rights are mutually respected.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In Part II of the book, Rodin turns his attention to the various analogical possibilities on offer.<span style="">  </span>I'll refer to these collectively as the 'defensive strategies'.<span style="">  </span>The resulting taxonomy is fairly complicated (see the diagram on p. 125, which identifies eight possibilities), but the relevant options fall, roughly speaking, into two camps: the 'reductive' strategy, and the 'analogical' strategy.<span style="">  </span>The reductive strategy characterises war as something like a composite set of individual acts of self-defense, whereas the analogical strategy gives super-personal, state actors a place in the analysis.<span style="">  </span>As Rodin sensibly remarks (p.129), it is difficult to make sense of the ways in which wars are conducted unless we give an irreducible role to state actors, not just those individuals who happen to be affected by the prosecution of war.<span style="">  </span>This consideration requires us to abandon a 'pure' reductive strategy, but it still permits a reductive description of the <i>end</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> of the right to go to war, which will be concerned with the preservation of those individual lives threatened by military attack.<span style="">  </span>By contrast, the analogical strategy will characterise the end of the right to go to war as being concerned with the preservation of the state, and with the goods of political association.<span style="">  </span>Let us consider these in turn.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Rodin identifies a number of problems with the reductive strategy.<span style="">  </span>First, this strategy cannot accommodate the component of Just War Theory--its <i>jus in bello</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> component--that insists upon the justifiability of military action by soldiers on both sides of the conflict.<span style="">  </span>This puts Just War Theory at odds with a theory of personal self-defense because, as we have seen, the theory of personal self-defense insists on a normative asymmetry between victims and attackers.<span style="">  </span>Second, the reductive strategy will cut wars of national-defense and wars of humanitarian intervention from the same normative cloth, as both types of conflict are concerned with the saving of individual lives.<span style="">  </span>This is problematic for Just War Theory, and for international law, as neither makes any unambiguous allowance for humanitarian intervention.<span style="">  </span>Third, there is the 'argument from bloodless invasion', which points to the possibility of an invasion of a state's territory which is only conditionally threatening, or threatening only given armed resistance to it.<span style="">  </span>Neither Just War Theory nor international law insist upon acquiescence to such an invasion, yet the theory of personal self-defense does not sanction a victim's lethal resistance to threats that are conditionally but not imminently lethal, since it insists upon a victim's duty to retreat, on pain of violation of the proportionality condition.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Rodin also argues that the analogical strategy is flawed.<span style="">  </span>First, although the goods of political association, such as the goods of collective self-determination, are surely not convincingly realised by deeply oppressive regimes, Just War Theory and international law aim to protect <i>every</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> sovereign state from unauthorised aggression.<span style="">  </span>Second, even if we were to insist that states must meet some condition of non-oppressiveness in order to warrant moral consideration, there would still be the problem of explaining why the invasion of one non-oppressive state by another non-oppressive state is objectionable.<span style="">  </span>As Rodin sees matters, the analogical strategy is unable to capture the <i>particularity</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> of the value of the form of political association to the <i>particular</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> citizens encompassed by it, without succumbing to an unwelcome form of relativism about value.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One general problem with the trajectory of argument in this part of the book is that Rodin requires the defensive strategies to be tightly contoured to the existing content of Just War Theory and the international legal order that has been, to some extent, erected upon it.<span style="">  </span>This requirement unduly narrows the prospects for the defensive strategies.<span style="">  </span>It overlooks the possibility that the defensive strategies may make an important contribution to a <i>revisionary</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> account of war that is less reverential towards state boundaries, and that is more hospitable to humanitarian intervention.<span style="">  </span>So, rather than dismissing the defensive strategies because of their failure to uphold the shibboleths of Just War Theory and international law, they might instead be retained and used to prompt revision in Just War Theory and international law.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To take an important example, and as Rodin himself demonstrates, the two components of Just War Theory--<i>jus ad bellum</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> and <i>jus in bello</i></span><span lang="EN-GB">--fail to meet up in a satisfactory manner.<span style="">  </span>The basic problem can be put like this.<span style="">  </span>According to <i>jus ad bellum</i></span><span lang="EN-GB">, only one side to a war, at most, can be credited with a just cause.<span style="">  </span>But the <i>jus in bello</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> component insists on the justifiability of combat on <i>both</i></span><span lang="EN-GB"> sides.<span style="">  </span>This oddity isn't resolved by the reflection that soldiers on an unjust side are typically conscripted and ignorant, for such considerations would furnish them only with an excuse, not a full-blown justification.<span style="">  </span>Given that the war is taking place, there are of course certain military operations by the unjust side that would compound the wrongness of their initial participation.<span style="">  </span>But unjust combatants' moral accountability for the additional non-combatant atrocities they commit in the course of a war does not require that they be classified as just combatants in the first place.<span style="">  </span>To think otherwise would be to argue in the following manner: if X is going to murder Y, X should murder Y gently; X is going to murder Y; so, X should murder Y gently; so, since X can't murder Y gently without murdering Y, X should murder Y.<span style="">  </span>Needless to say, this conclusion is to be avoided at all costs!</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Rodin's criticisms of the analogical strategy also seem unconvincing.<span style="">  </span>While he argues that the goods realised by one non-oppressive state may be similar in kind to the goods realised by any other, he does not explain why a supposedly non-oppressive state would have any business in invading another non-oppressive state.<span style="">  </span>Were any such invasion to take place, the citizens of the invaded state would surely have every reason for suspecting that the aims of the aggressive state were not benign, and that their basic security was at intolerable risk.<span style="">  </span>The 'duty to retreat' invoked in the theory of personal self-defense seems irrelevant here: once a state has been invaded, there is, by assumption, nowhere for its citizens to retreat to.</span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <span lang="EN-GB">One final remark.<span style="">  </span>Rodin argues that his envisaged universal minimal state would have the authority--in virtue, chiefly, of its impartiality--to engage in war in order to enforce international law.<span style="">  </span>But many of the problems he raises for the defensive strategies are likely to affect the viability of his own proposal.<span style="">  </span>If bloodless invasion is to be preferred to bloody non-surrender, and if one form of non-oppressive political association is as good as any other, then why, exactly, would international law carry a provision for war, at least in cases not involving genocidal extermination?<span style="">  </span>If there are good answers to this question, then it would seem that friends of the defensive strategies are straightforwardly entitled to take advantage of them</span>
