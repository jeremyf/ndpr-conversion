	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Logi</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> <i style="">Philosophy  of Personal Identity and Multiple Personality</i> focuses on the question of whether it is possible for more than one person  (understood as a "fundamental entity" and not merely a set of personality or character traits) to exist in a single human body. His purview is "multiple personality" broadly defined to include the psychiatric phenomena of "multiple personality disorder" or, as it is officially called today, "dissociative identity disorder," as well as fictional cases and thought-experimental cases involving doppelgangers. For  details he draws on three main sources: Morton Prince's seminal work, <i style="">The  Dissociation of a Personality</i>, <i style="">Amongst Ourselves: A  Self-Help Guide to Living with Dissociative Identity Disorder</i> by Tracy Alderman and Karen Marshall, and the 1996  novel, <i style="">Fight Club,</i> by Chuck Palahniuk. After developing a theory of personal identity, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> applies it in an analysis of the cases. He concludes that, although the metaphysics of personal identity allows for the possibility of more than  one person in a single human body, there are probably no actual cases and the  fictional cases, as described, do not warrant that interpretation. Despite some reservations that I have concerning his overall approach and some  questions about some of his specific arguments, his book is a fine contribution to  the discussion of the phenomenon of multiple personality and, more broadly,  to issues of personal identity. The analysis is sharp<span class="GramE">;</span> the writing, clear and succinct.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The work is divided into  three parts. Part I <span class="GramE">is</span> mainly introductory and begins with  an overview of the main issues concerning personal identity: What am I fundamentally? What accounts for my individuation and diachronic  identity as the same fundamental entity? What accounts for the individuation and  diachronic identity of a personality of such a fundamental entity? Who am <span class="GramE">I or what is my "true" self</span>? What is a person in a descriptive sense? How is the moral status <i style="">person</i> to be understood and what gives an entity this status? <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> focuses on the first two questions and treats them as independent of the  kind of considerations raised by the last two descriptive and evaluative  questions. Although the first question is framed with the use of the personal  pronoun, his answer deliberately avoids reliance on a concept of <i style="">person </i>and  seeks to explicate our fundamental nature in terms of agency, psychological relations, and responsibility. This puts his work  in the mainstream analytical discussion of personal identity, where the  theories have attempted to understand personal identity in terms of some internal  relation between psychological or physical states. In my view, such approaches mistakenly tend to ignore or reject the idea that persons are  essentially relational beings or socially constructed, such that their conditions  for individuation and identification cannot be given independently of how  they stand in relation to others. Such a constructivist view may not assume a  sharp distinction between the descriptive and evaluative nature of persons and  accordingly may be incompatible with the idea that there is some purely  philosophical or metaphysical account of personal identity independent of considerations  of the <span class="GramE">psycho-social</span> relations, cultural <span class="SpellE">embeddedness</span>, and moral considerations of persons. For this reason, I find that <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> approach, like a good deal of the  mainstream analytical discussion of personal identity, is limited in its  consideration of what is relevant to answering the main questions.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Another aspect of <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> approach that I find puzzling concerns his use of the term "fundamental entity." In contrast to Eric Olson and David Wiggins, he does not assume that the answer to the question "What am I fundamentally?" must specify a substance concept. Thus, he writes,</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">What  I am fundamentally may not be anything that is somehow ontologically  fundamental. For example, it may be that humans are ontologically more fundamental  than persons. This does not exclude the possibility that the correct answer  to the question 'What am I fundamentally?' is 'a person.' In other words, what I  am fundamentally may not be a substance (p. 196, fn. 8).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Gunnarsson</span></span><span lang="EN-AU">, however, never clarifies what he means by "fundamental," if he does not understand it in some ontological sense. Moreover, his  main thesis about multiple personality relies on a notion of agency that  presupposes that we are more than simply bundles of psychological states. If not  bundles of states, why <i style="">not</i> understand the agent, i.e., the fundamental entity that he thinks we are, as a substance of  some psychological kind, for example, along lines suggested by E. J. Lowe?</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Despite these initial  reservations, what <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> accomplishes in the vein of the  mainstream analytical discussion is significant. Part I continues with a succinct  overview of the main theories of diachronic personal identity, distinguishing  between the non-circular, empirical theories of biological continuity,  psychological continuity, and bodily continuity and the non-empirical, circular  theories of continuity of the same mental entity (dualism) and continuity of an  inner, first-person perspective. He identifies two main problems for the  empirical, non-circular theories. Both are familiar from the literature. First, by assuming the "only x and y principle" (that the diachronic identity of x and y can only depend on factors intrinsic to x, y or the relations between them), empirical theories cannot account for cases of  duplication. <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> offers the case of  Fair who undergoes an operation in which two successors, L-Fairchild and R-Fairchild, <span class="GramE">are</span> each given one of the halves of Fair's brain.  If only L-Fairchild exists, the empirical theories hold that L-Fairchild is  identical to <span class="GramE">Fair</span>. However, if both successors exist  and the same relation holds between each successor and Fair, then the empirical theories would seem to imply that both are identical to Fair. However,  since L-Fairchild is not identical to R-Fairchild, the transitivity of  identity shows that the empirical theory must be false. The second problem is that the empirical theories cannot account for the "unity reaction" -- the intuition that it is possible that after undergoing an operation such as  Fair receives, one would wake up with the feelings of one of the successors  but not the other, even though there is no empirically describable difference  between the connections of Fair to each of the successors. If this is possible,  then the empirical, non-circular theories must be false. The main problem for non-empirical, circular theories is that they cannot explain why a  person is the same person after awaking from a coma. Since such theories deny that  any empirical continuity can guarantee that the same person exists over  time, they provide no more reason for thinking that the same person exists than  that the same person does not exist. <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span>  concludes that any adequate theory of personal identity must meet three conditions of adequacy: solve the duplication problem, account for the truth of the "unity reaction," and accept empirical criteria of diachronic identity to avoid the coma problem.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Gunnarsson</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> notes that "the unity reaction is a reaction from the first-person perspective" and that it implies nothing about fission  cases in general or what to say about cases such the Ship of <span class="SpellE">Theseus</span> (p. 32). He then states that the unity reaction provides a criterion of adequacy "only to questions about <i style="">our</i> identity" and that "This fits in with my interpretation of the identity of fundamental entities as an issue concerning the conditions  of identity of human beings who can ask the question 'What am I?'" (p. 32). Although <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> promises early on not to  preclude any answers to the question "What am I fundamentally?<span class="GramE">",</span> this assumption about what is at issue precludes the possibility of  animalism being true. Since mentality, including the ability to ask the question "What am I?<span class="GramE">",</span> is irrelevant to the animalist answer to what we are fundamentally, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span>  has ruled out animalism from the start by requiring that any adequate theory  of personal identity must account for the truth of the "unity reaction." Later in the work, he endorses Lowe's criticism of the "cinematographic fallacy" in Olson's animalism that mistakenly denies how conditions of diachronic identity are necessary to explain qualitative differences (p.  66). <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> also holds that he cannot  be identical to a fetus or an individual in a permanent vegetative state, since the  diachronic identity of the kind of fundamental entity that he is talking about --  dare I say an "I" or "person" -- requires the ability to have mental functions. While I think that there are significant difficulties  with animalism and that <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> points out  some of them in the work, his assumption about what it means to ask the question  "What am I fundamentally?" that rules out animalism from the start is significant in the context of a discussion of whether more than one  fundamental entity may exist in a single human body over time. Since animalism  identifies the "I" with the biological organism, there is only one fundamental entity as long as that organism exists. Animalism, if true, would thus  present a major challenge to <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span>  co-existence thesis, the view that it is possible for more than one fundamental  entity to exist in a single human body.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In Part II, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> develops his empirical, circular philosophical theory of personal  identity over time. He begins by criticizing psychological continuity theories of  personal identity, such as <span class="SpellE">Parfit's</span>, on grounds that  they misinterpret the significance of everyday belief revision for personal  identity. According to the psychological continuity criterion, P1 and P2 are  identical only if there are enough semantically similar, psychological connections between P1 and P2. Since belief revision involves adopting a belief at a  later time that is not semantically similar to a belief at an earlier time, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> points out that on <span class="SpellE">Parfit's</span> psychological continuity criterion belief revision counts as a "'<i style="">minus point</i>' with respect to the identity of fundamental entities" (p. 44). However, he thinks that this  is entirely wrongheaded:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">When  somebody revises her belief, she commits <i style="">herself</i> to a new belief. She must therefore be the one who has the new belief.  This means that belief revision should not be understood as a "minus point" with respect to the identity of fundamental entities. On the contrary: precisely <i style="">because</i> somebody revises her belief, identity is preserved across the whole process. This  brief argument suffices as a refutation of the psychological criterion. (p.  44)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This criticism leads directly  to <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> own account of the identity  of fundamental entities. Belief revision or commitment anew to the truth of something,  e.g., "that the post office closes at 6 p.m.," establishes an empirical connection between the old and new beliefs and thus diachronic identity  rests on an empirical relation (p. 45). However, since the relation of  revision of belief or commitment presupposes identity, the diachronic account of  identity is circular. All that is necessary for belief revision or belief  maintenance is that the person be "minimally responsible" for her beliefs. A person is minimally responsible for a belief if she believes it to be true but  could revise her belief, regardless of whether she actively acquired the  belief in the first place or whether it is realistic to expect her to change her  belief. <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> "Authorial Correlate  Theory" thus holds: "I am fundamentally an agent who is a correlate to the psychological relations for which this agent is minimally responsible"  (p. 48).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">He goes on to argue that this  empirical, circular theory satisfies the three conditions of adequacy for the  identity of fundamental entities understood as agents capable of revising their  beliefs. <span class="GramE">First, since the person in a coma could  express commitments that she had before the coma, if she were to awake, commitment continuity and therefore personal identity holds throughout the coma.</span> Second,  the relations of commitment revision and maintenance cannot obtain between  the pre-fission person and her successors, since these relations presuppose  that the <span class="GramE">person</span> who originally has the commitment  and who can reconsider it at a later time are the same fundamental entity. Thus,  by definition, commitment revision or maintenance could not obtain between  one fundamental entity and the successors, i.e., two non-identical  fundamental entities. Third, in contrast to non-empirical theories, the commitment criterion does justice to the "unity reaction" by acknowledging the possibility that the original person could be identical to only one of  the successors, but it denies that this is the case on empirical grounds and considerations of supervenience that the commitment relation cannot  exist between only one of the successors and not the other.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Gunnarsson</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> then considers the relationship between the fundamental  entity that he is and his body. Is it possible for him to change bodies? Or does  commitment continuity entail that the same material being must exist in order for  him to exist? <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> considers Shoemaker's  thought experiments involving "brain-state transfer (BST)" in which the complete states of a person's brain are transferred to a cloned body and  the old body is destroyed. He also considers the film, <i style="">Multiplicity</i>,  in which the main character, Doug, agrees to have <span class="GramE">himself</span>  cloned and in which all of his bodily and psychological characteristics are perfectly copied. <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> intuitions run with the film's portrayal that Doug is identical with the original human being that continues to exist through the cloning process  and not with the cloned copy. However, he also gives a more principled  answer to the thought experiments in which he relies on a distinction between  making commitments and choosing to have previously made commitments copied.  Gunnarsson argues that the former ensures identity but the latter doesn't. In the  former case, because Doug is minimally responsible for his commitments, either  because he actively made each commitment or did not get rid of it, the physical  basis of the commitment in Doug's brain is a direct result of something that  Doug did. In the latter case, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> argues  that Doug's relationship to the copies made of his commitments is entirely different, since he is not responsible for the copying process. "This holds," <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> claims, "even if he (Doug) chooses to have them copied and pushes the button that starts the copying process" (p. 64). He <span class="GramE">concludes that</span> "the continued existence of a material being is necessary for the continued existence of the fundamental entity embodied by that material being" (p. 64).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This is not a very strong  argument. It is not clear why we <i style="">should not</i> say that the physical basis of the beliefs in the cloned body is the direct  result of something that Doug did. Indeed, compared to a belief commitment that  Doug did not actively acquire but may have passively received and never  actively changed, deliberately pushing the button to have his beliefs copied  seems to demonstrate more of a commitment to the maintenance of those beliefs  than never changing a belief that one has and could change, but never considered  changing. I think that a better strategy for <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span>  (and for Shoemaker who has argued along similar lines) is to give up the idea  that such questions can be answered by appealing to some relations internal  to the relations between the mental states or physical states and appeal to  some external moral or social considerations that may bear on the  determination of personal identity. For example, there might be good moral and social  reasons for banning the type of cloning portrayed in <i style="">Multiplicity </i>and  for therefore denying Doug's identity with his clone, just as there are good moral and social reasons for banning the  forging of currency and therefore denying that forged currency is the same as  genuine currency. Such an externalist strategy, however, is most likely  inconsistent with the "only x or y principle."</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Gunnarsson</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> understands the relation between the person and human  being as one of material constitution, analogous to the relation between a particular  statue and the material of which it is made. In his view, fundamental entities  like you and I come into being when certain living beings acquire agency,  i.e., the capacity to make commitments. <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span>  does not aim to make any original contribution to an understanding of material  constitution, but instead draws on the work of others, particularly, E. J. Lowe, to  defend the view against objections raised by Eric Olson. In <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> and Lowe's view, persons are distinguished from the living beings that constitute them because they have different conditions of diachronic  identity. Whereas personal identity is dependent on the ability to exercise mental functions, the identity of living beings consists of exercising certain  life functions that have nothing to do with mentality. According to <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span>, a person was never a <span class="SpellE">fetus</span> and could not exist in a permanent vegetative state, since the  diachronic conditions of the identity of a person require mentality. However, not  just any type of mentality will do. <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span>  refines this notion of mentality by distinguishing "experiences" from "experiences in the strict sense." An infant lacking the cognitive ability to make commitments may have "experiences." However, because propositional and conceptual structures are necessary for an experience to serve as a justificatory basis for commitments, an infant cannot have "experiences  in the strict sense" -- the sense in which an experience can be personal, i.e., that of an "I". He concludes:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-AU">my</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> existence begins with  the capacity to have experiences where experiences are understood as something that  only a being capable of making commitments can have. There is a clear intuitive  sense in which anything that occurs prior to the existence of such an agent  cannot count as <i style="">my experience</i>. (p. 70)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Gunnarsson</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> has reason to reject Olson's animalism, and "material constitution" well suits his ontological distinction between persons and human organisms. However, it is unclear why he needs to insist that  experiences must be structured propositionally in order to serve as a basis for commitments. While the experiences of an infant may not be  propositionally structured to serve in a schema of rational justification, they may be sufficiently structured to provide the infant with rudimentary knowledge  about the world and interests. For example, a <span class="SpellE">fetus</span>  or infant may respond to the sound of a mother's voice and have an interest  in interacting with the mother, even though the infant lacks the conceptual ability to structure experience in propositional and justificatory  terms. Such mental experience may entail commitment on the part of the infant in a <span class="SpellE">behavioral</span> and adaptive sense though not in a  rational, justificatory sense. Presumably, <span class="GramE">such conscious  experience is had by someone</span>. Indeed, on P. F. <span class="SpellE">Strawson's</span> account of ownership of experience, such conscious experience attributed  to another on the basis of <span class="SpellE">behavioral</span> criteria  may be sufficient as a basis for distinguishing my experiences as mine from the  other person's experience as hers. Evidence for attributing conscious  experience to someone need not require commitment, in <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> more developed sense, on the part of the individual who has the  experience. Indeed, all of us may have cognitively lower-level experiences to which  we could never reflectively commit, although we may in fact be committed to  them in an adaptive and interested way. They should therefore count as our experiences. Broadening the scope of experiences that may count as  personal experiences would not threaten <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> ontological distinction between persons/fundamental entities and human  beings, although the time when a person comes into being and stops existing  would be altered. For example, I could not exist as an early <span class="SpellE">fetus</span> or as an individual in a permanent vegetative state, but I could exist  as a late term <span class="SpellE">fetus</span> with conscious experience or  in a minimally conscious state at the end of my life. Diminished mental  experience would still be my experience but I could not exist with amentia.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Gunnarsson</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> ends Part II with a discussion of how his authorial  correlate theory provides a framework for addressing the various issues raised  about personal identity and how it differs from alternative approaches,  especially the kind of narrative, self-constitution view offered by <span class="SpellE">Marya</span> <span class="SpellE">Schechtman</span>. In Part III, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> then applies his theory to an analysis of multiple personality. In his consideration of Morton Prince's case of Miss Beauchamp and her  personalities, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> shows how the  authorial correlate theory explains why there is only one fundamental entity in this case. Because  belief commitment about, for example, the state of the weather for the day, is continuous through the manifestations of the various personalities of  Miss Beauchamp, the various personalities are phases of one and the same  fundamental entity. <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> suggests that while <span class="SpellE">Schechtman's</span> narrative, self-constitution view  might explain why Miss Beauchamp's personalities are <span class="GramE">different,</span> the commitment criterion shows why they are personalities of only one fundamental entity. This simple, incisive point is then applied in <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> criticism of alternative theories  that would have us think that there is more than one fundamental entity in cases of multiple personality. In particular, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> offers strong, detailed criticism of the views of <span class="SpellE">Radden</span>, Dennett, Flanagan, and <span class="SpellE">Rovane</span>. At bottom, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> argues that they all ignore how  commitment continuity of belief obtains in these cases.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Gunnarsson</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> spends the most time on <span class="SpellE">Rovane</span>.  One of his criticisms that focuses on the explanation of project neutral  beliefs and judgment is particularly significant, because it shows how <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> tells a causal story to explain belief commitment. Suppose, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> asks, that someone with one personality (e.g., a person in a  musician-state) pursues a project on Thursday and happens to notice a cafÃ© during that  time (p. 121). The cafÃ© is irrelevant to the pursuit of the music project and the cluster of traits associated with being in a music-state. But then  suppose that on the following day, when the individual has a different personality,  e.g., the person is now in a philosopher-state, the person returns to the cafÃ©  to read Schopenhauer. According to <span class="SpellE">Rovane</span>, if  the musician-state and philosopher-state demonstrate distinct unified,  rational points of view, there is more than one person in the body. There is no  one person that acts on Thursday and Friday. However, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> argues that such an interpretation fails to account for how the person  who noticed the cafÃ© on Thursday used the knowledge on Friday. He suggests  that <span class="SpellE">Rovane</span> could coherently explain what  happens by suggesting that the one person on Thursday can share a token of a type of belief  with the person on Friday. However, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> points  out that this entails a <span class="SpellE"><i style="">reductio</i></span><i style=""> ad absurdum</i>: How can someone obtain a belief on Thursday and then someone who never obtained the belief <span class="GramE">have</span> it on Friday? Since there is continuity of  belief commitment about the existence of the cafÃ© from Thursday to Friday, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> argues that there is only one  fundamental entity.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In this criticism, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> relies on the relevance of the particular causal history of the belief.  One person is responsible for the belief about the cafÃ©, and having a belief  must come through the normal causal process of observation and assent.  However, one can come to have beliefs through other causal routes. Although there is  no easy explanation of how the philosopher-state person could come to have the  belief on Friday, it is not clear why, as noted above, a particular causal  route, as in the way Doug's clone committed to certain beliefs in contrast to how  the original remains committed to those beliefs, is so significant. Perhaps  the musician-state person conveys this information to the philosopher-state  person on some level, somewhat analogous to the way Abigail <span class="SpellE">Hensel</span> (one of two conjoined twins) but not Brittany <span class="SpellE">Hensel</span> (the other conjoined twin) might acquire a belief on Thursday and convey  that information to Brittany on Friday.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In chapter 10, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> argues against animalism and for the "co-existence thesis," i.e., the possibility that more than one person can be in a single human body. The simplest case in support of this claim is the case of conjoined twins,  such as Abigail and Brittany <span class="SpellE">Hensel</span>, in which there  are "two entirely separate sources of passive psychological states, active attitudes, actions, and capacities" (p. 129). However, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> does not stop here. He constructs a series of thought experiments in an  effort to show how such a complete separation of mental functions could exist  in a human body with a single head and even a single brain, but different  control <span class="SpellE">centers</span> for mentality. Critical to  the thought experiments is the assumption that each of the two fundamental entities must acquire  their capacities, active attitudes, and passive mental states for themselves  and that there are no causal connections between the capacities, attitudes, and  states that each acquires within their common brain. <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> then observes that in actual cases of multiple personality or  dissociative identity disorder, such a complete separation of mental functions does  not exist among the multiples, as they demonstrate continuity of belief  commitment. Therefore, only one fundamental entity exists in those cases.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Having argued for the  possibility of more than one fundamental entity in a single body, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> devotes the next chapter to explaining how material constitution can  account for the relationship between such fundamental entities and a single  human body. There is some interesting discussion of an objection to his view on  grounds that it entails a false account of awareness of one's own body. If the perceiving subject is not something inner and separate from the  phenomenal body, as <span class="SpellE">Merleau-Ponty</span> has claimed, how can  there be more than one perceiving subject in a single body? <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> aims to show how his view is consistent with <span class="SpellE">Merleau-Ponty's</span> view once it is recognized that there can be two entirely separate  bodily ways of experiencing the same physical stimulus in a single living being. <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> also considers an objection of Lynne  Rudder Baker that there are bodily limitations that would prevent the  expression of more than one person in a body. For example, how can a single body  express a relaxed state of one fundamental entity and an agitated state of another fundamental entity at the same time? <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> argues that the possibility for more than one fundamental entity in a  single body assumes that they are never co-active and, that even if they were,  bodies could express some, but perhaps not all, conflicting attitudes.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In Chapter 12, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> discusses what is involved in the ownership of mental states and  proposes a rationalist account in which mental states belong to an individual if  the individual is minimally responsible for them through commitments (active states) or could base judgments on passive states, such as perceptions.  Because <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> holds that different individuals  (agents) cannot share tokens of passive mental states, any case in which a  passive mental state could serve as the basis for a commitment would belong to  one fundamental entity. Thus, recalling his earlier criticism of <span class="SpellE">Rovane's</span> view, the "philosopher-person" on Friday and "musician-person" on Thursday are the same fundamental entity, since both can form commitments from the same token passive experience  of noticing the cafÃ© on Thursday. They may be different personalities but  not different persons.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Gunnarsson</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> uses this idea of ownership of mental states to argue  that two fundamental entities cannot be linked by memory of passive states or the retaining of psychological capacities and that this leads to acceptance  of the following "CAP (mental capacities, active attitudes, and passive states) criterion" as necessary and sufficient for the individuation of fundamental entities: </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">(1)  PY is incapable of having any of the types of <span class="SpellE">CAPs</span>  that PX acquires (at odd times) or memories of them unless PY acquires these  type of <span class="SpellE">CAPs</span> <span class="GramE">himself</span>  (at even times). (2) PX is incapable of having any of the types of CAPS that PY acquires (at  even times) or memories of them, unless PX acquires these types of <span class="SpellE">CAPs</span> himself (at odd times). (3) PY is a  fundamental entity existing over time. PX is a fundamental entity existing over time. If  (1)-(3) <span class="GramE">are</span> fulfilled, PX and PY are two  fundamental entities. (<span class="GramE">pp</span>. 135-136)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">There is some interesting  discussion of how this approach to the individuation of fundamental entities differs  from that of <span class="SpellE">Sinnott</span>-Armstrong and Stephen <span class="SpellE">Behnke</span>. Also, whereas most theories of personal  identity offer a single criterion for the individuation and identity, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> theory is unusual in that he offers  the CAP criterion as a criterion for individuation and commitment continuity as a criterion of diachronic identity.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In the two concluding  chapters, <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson</span> applies his authorial  correlate theory to an analysis of multiple personality in therapeutic and biographic  discourses (primarily the Beauchamp case and <i style="">Amongst Ourselves</i>) and literary discourses (primarily <i style="">The Fight  Club</i>). He concludes that these cases are best interpreted as involving multiple personalities in a single fundamental entity but  not multiple fundamental entities.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">I have tried to provide a  relatively detailed account of <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> main  arguments, because they are carefully formulated and speak for themselves. His  Authorial Correlate Theory deserves serious consideration, as it offers a  plausible alternative to abandoning "personal identity" in <span class="SpellE">favor</span> of "survival" as to what matters to us about our identity. Also, any future philosophical discussion of multiple personality will need to  come to terms with <span class="SpellE">Gunnarsson's</span> robust analysis.</span></p>
