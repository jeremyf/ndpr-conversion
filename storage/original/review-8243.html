<p class="MsoBodyText">Douglas Walton's <i>Abductive Reasoning</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> presents both an introduction to abductive reasoning (including inference to the best explanation) and an interesting and critical assessment of the most important parts of the literature, leading to Walton's own normative theory of abduction and his advice on how we should approach a number of unsolved problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">As a review of the literature, this book is excellent, citing not only the most important standard works on its topic but also some generally overlooked sections of the literature.<span style="">  </span>In addition, this book contains many excellent insights.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, it is written in a pleasant style.<span style="">  </span>It is, however, a little wordy, and thus does not tell us as much about its topic as one might expect from a 303-page book.<span style="">  </span>As an example of what I mean by wordiness: immediately following an already very full discussion of Polya's description of a reverse modus ponens, we read:<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Polya's remarks on this subject are very interesting in regard to the subject of the analysis of abductive reasoning.<span style="">  </span>They are especially interesting in light of Peirce's theory (or at least Fann's version of it) that the logical form of abductive reasoning is a kind of reverse <i>modus ponens</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> inference just like the heuristic inference described by Polya above.<span style="">  </span>A number of questions are raised.<span style="">  </span>Does abductive reasoning of the kind described by Polya occur commonly in mathematical research in the way Polya outlined?<span style="">  </span>And if the kind of mathematical reasoning described by Polya can properly be classified as abductive, can his representation of it as a kind of reverse </span><i>modus ponens</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> form of argument (the heuristic above) be taken generally to represent the form of abductive inference as an identifiable kind of plausible reasoning?<span style="">  </span>These are large questions, and without some better account of abduction than we presently have, there does not seem to be any way to answer them. (p.16)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">The first of those questions is never answered.<span style="">  </span>The second question was already asked on the previous page and will be asked again before the current page is out.<span style="">  </span>In terms of content this is fine, but I would have preferred it if, instead of the whole paragraph quoted above, I had only had to read:<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">We do not yet have an account which can tell us whether Polya's heuristic can be used to describe abduction.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">I have only one other complaint worth mentioning.<span style="">  </span>Walton mixes up -- in the literal sense, and I think also in the intellectual sense -- two vitally different possible meanings of "best" in "inference to the best explanation".<span style="">  </span>One possible meaning is <i>most explanatory</i><span style="font-style: normal;">; the other is </span><i>most plausible</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>The following two cases (for example) are both presented as inferences to the best explanation without any mention of this important difference between them. Firstly, sometimes "best" means </span><i>most explanatory</i><span style="font-style: normal;">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">JOSEPHSON AND JOSEPHSON (J & J) FORM OF ABDUCTIVE INFERENCE<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">D is a collection of data.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">H explains D.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">No other hypothesis can explain D as well as H does.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Therefore H is probably true. (p.20, paraphrasing Josephson and Josephson p.14)<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Here, we are not meant to wonder whether H is plausible; only whether it is explanatory.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">A side issue here -- but a major one, I'm afraid -- is that this scheme falls to an obvious objection: that the hypothesis H' that an omnipotent demon caused D is always at least as explanatory as any other hypothesis; hence, we must require at least some degree of plausibility of H.<span style="">  </span>It seems to me that Walton's own preferred definition of abductive inference falls prey to just this objection.<span style="">  </span>His definition is in two parts, both of which are subject to the demon objection if either is.<span style="">  </span>I quote just one of them, for brevity:<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">BACKWARD ARGUMENTATION SCHEME FOR ABDUCTIVE INFERENCE<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">D is a set of data or supposed facts in a case.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Each one of a set of accounts A<sub>1</sub>,A<sub>2</sub>, . . . ,A<sub>n</sub> is successful in explaining D.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">A<sub>i</sub> is the account that explains D most successfully.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Therefore A<sub>i</sub> is the most plausible hypothesis in the case. (p.218) <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">To return to the ambiguity issue: secondly, sometimes "best" means <i>most plausible</i><span style="font-style: normal;">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">THE ROBBERY EXAMPLE<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The fact that before a robbery <b>a</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="">  </span>had no money, but after had a large sum, is offered to indicate that he by robbery became possessed of the large sum of money.<span style="">  </span>There are several other possible explanations -- the receipt of a legacy, the payment of a debt, the winning of a gambling game, and the like.<span style="">  </span>Nevertheless, the desired explanation rises, among other explanations, to a fair degree of plausibility, and the evidence is received. (p.25, quoting from Wigmore, p.420)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Here, all the explanations mentioned are equally good in the explanatory sense.<span style="">  </span>The robbery explanation is preferred only because it is most plausible (given that there was a robbery).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Failure to mark this distinction is particularly disappointing given that previous literature such as Lipton's book on inference to the best explanation, is careful to do so.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">In summary, I cannot recommend this book to generalist philosophers looking for an efficient introduction to abductive inference.<span style="">  </span>It is, however, a very worthwhile read for specialists in inference to the best explanation.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">REFERENCES<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Josephson, John R., and Josephson, Susan G.
