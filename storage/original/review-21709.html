	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Taylor Carman's book on  Merleau-Ponty is ambitious. It aims at covering Merleau-Ponty's philosophical works, from the early  study <i style="">The Structure of Behavior</i> (1942) to the latest unfinished manuscript <i style="">The Visible and the Invisible</i> (1964), and explicating the main arguments and  results, from the analysis of perception to discussions on language, arts, and  politics.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">For some decades Merleau-Ponty was a marginal  figure in Anglophone philosophy which was dominated by post-analytical, post-pragmatistic,  and post-structuralistic currents of thought, but today his philosophy is  embraced from all sides. Carman's work belongs to the Dreyfusian school which  combines Heideggerian phenomenology with American pragmatism and 20<sup>th</sup>  century analytical philosophy of mind. The book may serve as a useful  introduction to students who want to get a grip of the main topics and sections of Merleau-Ponty's works, but it suffers from a tendentious reading of the  sources and gives a superficial picture of Merleau-Ponty's innovative inquiries  into experience. More thorough and careful argumentation for the  interpretative choices and the systematic views would have added to the scholarly value  of the presentation.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The main problem is that Carman not only  diminishes and belittles Merleau-Ponty's continuous interchange with Husserlian  sources, an interchange which began in <i style="">Phenomenology</i> and continued until <i style="">The Visible</i>, but that he also states that Merleau-Ponty's relation to Husserl's classical phenomenology is oppositional and "antithetical" (e.g., 35, 37, 42-43). This is not just a problem of exegesis but more fundamentally a problem  in the understanding of philosophy, its tasks and the types of results that it  can offer.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carman claims, in a Wittgensteinian tone, that philosophical problems are "mysteries" for Merleau-Ponty (e.g., 6-7, 11, 26, 146-149). The claim implies the idea that philosophical problems  cannot be solved in the same way as theoretical or practical problems can be  solved, and this <i style="">implication</i> certainly belongs to Merleau-Ponty's view of philosophy. But mysteries, that is,  problems that escape both speech and vision, are not the only type of  non-theoretical and non-practical problems. Merleau-Ponty took seriously Husserl's  argument that there is a third category: problems which concern meaning  constitution and which require that we radicalize our methods of critical inquiry. These problems cannot be handled by any positive sciences -- mathematical, psychological, or logical-linguistic -- nor by life-practices. Still  they do not remain mysterious but can be solved by inquiring into the multitude  of experiencing and by radically questioning assumptions about being,  feeling, and willing.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carman argues that Merleau-Ponty's frequent and  detailed references to Husserl's mature and late works -- the second volume of <i style="">Ideas</i> (<i style="">Ideas II</i>), <i style="">The Crisis</i>,  <i style="">Formal and Transcendental Logic</i>, and <i style="">Experience  and Judgment</i> -- are just manifestations of Merleau-Ponty's "generous" attitude toward past thinkers (37-39). Further, he suggests that Merleau-Ponty is equally  generous to all the philosophers that he studies: Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza,  Kant, Hegel, and also Heidegger, Husserl's main critic. In such a framing, Merleau-Ponty's reformulation of phenomenology becomes a curious attempt  to balance between two demands of courtesy: to Husserl's egocentric  philosophy of consciousness and immanence, on the one hand, and to Heidegger's  existential perspectivism, on the other hand. Carman argues: </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">for Merleau-Ponty,  perception is not an inner subjective phenomenon, but a mode of existence, a  manifestation of our being in the world. Merleau-Ponty embraced this Heideggerian theme wholeheartedly; but then projected it retrospectively back onto  Husserl's phenomenology (42). </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">But this clearly is a mistake as we may notice  at the very beginning of <i style="">Phenomenology</i> where Merleau-Ponty explains: "the whole of <i style="">Sein und Zeit</i> springs from an indication given by Husserl and amounts to  no more than an explicit account of the 'natürlicher Weltbegriff' or the  'Lebenswelt' which Husserl, towards the end of his life, identified as the central  theme of phenomenology" (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 1995: viii).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Merleau-Ponty's <i style="">Phenomenology</i> is not a collection of gestures of generosity or courtesy but a rigorous attempt to <i style="">rethink</i> the foundations of perception and the perceptual world. Husserl's late works gave him an  excellent starting point, not by putting forward any form of immanentism or  solipsism, but by describing and analyzing intentionality as a multiform opening  onto the life-world.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carman neglects the most important motive that  connects Husserl's and Heidegger's philosophies: the new post-Kantian  understanding of the tasks of transcendental philosophy. This neglect leads him to divide phenomenology along the traditional lines of doctrinal philosophy: at  one end we have Husserl's "rationalism", "intellectualism", and "cognitivism", and at the opposite end we have Heidegger's mysticism, factualism, and pragmatism. But what Merleau-Ponty saw, perhaps more  clearly than anyone else in his time (up to the present), was the radical aims  of both philosophers. He took as his task to continue their work by digging into  the sediments of experience and by inquiring into the first institutions and grounds of human perception, a task that was outlined by Husserl but was  left unfinished (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 1995: 61-63, 361-365, 425-426).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This means that Merleau-Ponty did not abandon  Husserl's idea of philosophy as <i style="">radical</i> critique but, on the contrary, executed this idea in his own practice of thinking. He abandoned Kant's critical project which aimed at  identifying mere conditions of possibility without recognizing genetic problems of  temporal and historical constitution. He was not satisfied with any form of  philosophical mysticism or quietistism, but argued explicitly that the constitutional problems of meaning can be solved if classical phenomenology is  radicalized so that it questions its own limits and conditions of actuality: "A philosophy becomes transcendental, or radical, not by taking its place  in absolute consciousness without mentioning the ways by which this is  reached, but by considering itself as a problem" (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 1995: 63, cf. 219). This radicalization, Merleau-Ponty believed, can be  accomplished if phenomenology engages in a dialogue with empirical <i style="">sciences  of life</i>. The aim is not to fuse the two lines of inquiry or to establish a new hybrid discipline, as Carman suggests (9), but to  fight against habits of idealization by exposing philosophical reflection to empirical inquiries into animal life: sensibility, sickness, sexuality,  and unconsciousness.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carman argues that Merleau-Ponty "rejected" Husserl's "semantic paradigm" and developed an ontology of the world (18, 27-28, 35ff., 74). This claim about opposition is grounded on a controversial reading of Husserl's philosophy, i.e., on the so-called  Fregean reading, which was originally proposed by Dagfinn Føllesdal and  developed and defended by his students (Dreyfus among them).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> In this reading, Husserl is presented as an intellectualistic or  cognitivistic philosopher who models all constituted sense and meaning on the paradigm  of <i style="">linguistic meaning</i>, its propositional forms and its conceptual structures. Thus Husserl is presented as a  follower of Frege, and Husserl's sophisticated analyses on intentionality and its  different forms are boiled down to the simple opposition between content (Fregean <i style="">sense</i>) and object (Fregean <i style="">reference</i>)  (16).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carman's exegetic decision has several  problematic consequences for the interpretations that he offers on Merleau-Ponty's systematic discussions of perception, embodiment, and thinking. When  classical phenomenology is framed as a burden to be left behind, or as a relic of Lockean-Cartesian mentalism or Leibnizian rationalism, then all its  analyses of phenomena, all its conceptual distinctions, and all its methodological  inventions have to be dispensed with. This concerns a vast stock of tools and  results that Merleau-Ponty found in Husserl's works: the concepts of passive  synthesis, sedimentation, and pre-conceptual types;<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[2]</span></a></sup></span> the analyses of embodiment, spatiality, and thinghood; and the methods  of genetic analysis and radical reflection. In the following, I will  discuss in brief the main thematic problems. I start from Carman's claim that Merleau-Ponty puts forward a general philosophy of perspectivism.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Carman argues that Merleau-Ponty's main  invention was the bodily and perspectival structure of sense-perception and that his aim  was to apply his perspectival analysis to all forms of experiencing and  understanding, from the sciences to politics and arts. He argues: "Merleau-Ponty undertakes an ambitious . . . program of extending his phenomenological  insight beyond sense perception into a general account of the perspectival  structure of all human experience and understanding" (3, cf. 9).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The problem with this interpretation is that it  neglects Merleau-Ponty's way of posing his problems and his methods for solving  them. The philosophical task that Merleau-Ponty sets in <i style="">Phenomenology</i>  concerns <i style="">origins</i> of experiencing, and the methods that he proposes are <i style="">genetic-phenomenological</i>:  </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Until some means has  been discovered whereby we can link the origin and the essence or meaning of  [the experience]; until some definition has been found for a <i style="">concrete  essence</i>, a <i style="">structure</i> of [the experience] which shall express both its generality and its particularity, until phenomenology has become genetic phenomenology,  unhelpful versions to causalism and naturalism will remain justified  (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 1995).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The aim is not to capture the general structures  of all experiencing and all understanding. Rather, Merleau-Ponty inquires back  into the intentional ground of experience and tries to disclose a primordial  form of conscious life that lies hidden under the sedimentations that support  our everyday experience and our sciences. This life is the life of a human  animal which orientates in lived space, moves through the elements of air and  water, and approaches its objects in desire or else avoids them in aversion. Merleau-Ponty does not claim that we are nothing but such animals, nor  does he suggest that all the forms of our understanding -- mathematical,  logical, linguistic, and aesthetic -- are bound by the structures of our  perceptual lives. His argument concerns <i style="">the genetic constitution</i> of consciousness: all our achievements, physical and  spiritual, have emerged historically, and must emerge, from a perceptual ground by different sorts of operations -- individual and communal.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Merleau-Ponty received from Husserl the concept  of <i style="">horizon</i>.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup> Both philosophers argue that all experiencing is horizontal, that is,  all experiences refer, by internal links of sense, to other experiences.  Moreover, Merleau-Ponty uses the concept of horizon to characterize the givenness  of the world and describes it as the "horizon of horizons" and the "style of all styles" ([1945] 1995: 330). The perspectival structure of sense-perception is just one specific type of horizontality, and this structure is lacking from many experiences and many entities that belong  to our everyday life and to our scientific practices.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup> A literary work, such as Simone de Beauvoir's <i style="">She Came to  Stay</i> for example (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 1964), is not given through perspectival adumbrations or by spatial profiles,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup> even if it refers by its sense to a whole history of writing. The  spatiality of thingly perception must not be confused with the historicity of  communication (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 1995: 432-433).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The second main problem in Carman's explication  is that it separates Merleau-Ponty's account of embodiment from its Husserlian  starting points and establishes a false opposition between the two. Carman argues  that for Husserl the living body (<i style="">Leib</i>) is a mere material thing with an "inserted" or "introjected" psychic content (127-131), a content that moreover is always, by  necessity, lent from one solipsistic subject (137-140). For Merleau-Ponty, such a  notion is nonsense, as it would be for anyone who is interested in human  experience, including Husserl. To be sure, the idea of introjection can be found in Husserl's <i style="">Ideas II</i> ([1952] 1993: 169), but to claim that this would be Husserl's final word on the topic  is simply a mistake ([1952] 1993: 175, 185-186). If one reads the whole of Husserl's <i style="">Ideas II</i> -- like Merleau-Ponty did -- and does not just focus on the two first parts  which deal with the constitution of the living body as it is given <i style="">in</i>  <i style="">the naturalistic attitude</i> of the sciences, then one discovers that Husserl argues that living  bodies are apprehended in <i style="">two different ways</i>: on the one hand, as <i style="">material things</i> with psychic determinants within the naturalistic attitude and, on the other  hand, as <i style="">expressive wholes</i> within the <i style="">personalistic  attitude</i>.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the naturalistic attitude, sense is given as a  psychic content introjected into the material body, but in the personalistic  attitude sense permeates the whole body, all its parts and all its levels, and  connects the body to other bodies by comprehensive relations of motivation and understanding (Husserl [1952] 1993: 200ff.). Moreover, Husserl agues  that the naturalistic attitude and its thingly body are dependent secondary  phenomena and come later in the constitutive order of experiencing than the  expressive body of the person. More precisely, the naturalistic attitude is a  result of a process of abstraction in which the thinking subject forgets its own  personal attachments to its environing world and absolutizes its object of  inquiry, i.e., nature (Husserl [1952] 1993: 193). Thus Husserl shows that the  two-layered mind-body compound, or the double psycho-physical reality, is not  original in our experiencing, but is a dependent formation.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Merleau-Ponty was impressed by this idea and by  Husserl's concept of the expressive body.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup>  His <i style="">Phenomenology</i> is an attempt to develop further the idea of expressive relations of sense and motivation, not  just as they are lived between human persons, but also as they are lived between  the perceiver and his material environment and between the different aspects  of our personal lives, perceptual, affective, intellectual: </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The analysis of  speech and expression brings home to us the enigmatic nature of our own body even  more effectively than did our remarks on bodily space and unity. It is not a collection of particles, each remaining in itself, nor yet a network of processes defined once and for all -- it is not where it is, nor what it  is -- since we see it secreting in itself a 'significance' which comes to it  from nowhere, projecting that significance upon its material surroundings,  and communicating it to other embodied subjects (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 1995:  197).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style="">Bibliography<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Depraz, Natalie: <i style="">Transcendance et incarnation: Le statut de l'intersubjectivité comme altérité à soi  chez Husserl</i>, Pris: Vrin.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Heidegger, Martin 1992: <i style="">History of  the Concept of Time, Prolegomena</i>, trans.

He tracks the former idea to Heidegger's fundamental  ontology and the latter to Gestalt psychology. A common starting point for both  is in Brentano's theory of parts and wholes that influenced the  phenomenological movements through Husserl's critique of Brentano and Gestalt theory  through Ehrenfels' early application (Heinämaa 2005).</p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup>  Strangely Carman attributes to Husserl the notion that perception is separated  from the perceived thing by an "abyss" (16, 42-43, cf. 33), a notion which is in direct contrast with Husserl's repeated arguments that the perceptual  object is not given in any as-if mode, by any representations or pictures, but  is there in full flesh (e.g. Husserl [1913] 1962).</p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="MsoBodyText"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup> Merleau-Ponty knew this work well and returned it to again and again  when developing his own account on embodiment. For a detailed discussion of  the relation of influence, see Toadvine 2002. Heidegger too knew Husserl's <i style="">Ideas II</i>, and studied it already in the 20s when preparing <i style="">Being and Time</i> (Heidegger 1992: 121).
