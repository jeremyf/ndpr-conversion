	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Richard  Gale professes to <span class="SpellE">favor</span> "determining the  greatness of a philosopher . . . by the morally beneficial effects that the philosopher's writings have  on the reader. By this criterion," he reckons, "John Dewey must be the greatest philosopher of all time" (9). However, Gale urges, Dewey's  "grand normative vision" -- a "pyramid" the apex of which is growth, and the supporting strata of which are inquiry, democracy, freedom, communication and education -- needs to be freed from "his misbegotten attempt to root it in his metaphysics" (16). This metaphysics in its  turn needs to be rescued from the implications of Dewey's "<span class="SpellE">metaphilosophical</span> theory about the nature of philosophy," which requires that a  metaphysical theory be verifiable and contribute to meliorating the problems of men.  This requirement "would rule out Dewey's metaphysics, along with most of his philosophy, as illegitimate" (<i style="">ibid</i>.).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-AU">The  thesis, thus outlined, could consistently be advanced by a sympathetic, if severe,  critic</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> -- even by one who casts his  "often quite harsh" criticisms in quite harsh terms (<i style="">ibid</i>.). It is possible, after all, to recognize that one's "hero" (12) on occasion "waffles" (123) and is sometimes guilty of "fanaticism" (18, 66, 71, 89), "bogus argument" (37), "gaseous talk" (43, 96), "mad dog pronouncement" (91) and even "moral idiocy" (69). However, some of Gale's irreverent images and comparisons are unflattering enough to stray into satire. In a "more enlightened society than ours, John Dewey would be a suitable subject for a Mattel action  figure -- with cord at the back which, when pulled, results in some of his choice pronouncements, like 'growth is inquiry', 'inquiry is democracy',  'democracy is education', 'education is growth'" (9) -- and whose "big bold original idea . . . earns him an <span class="SpellE">honored</span>  place in the Philosophical Hall of Fame in Steubenville, Ohio" (111).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Elsewhere Dewey is compared  to a "Madison Avenue huckster" (84), "a veritable Jack Horner who pulls out of experience whatever plum is required" (168), a "reformed metaphysician struggling to resist temptation", who "If he allows himself just one sip of metaphysics . . . will end . . . spouting  incoherent drivel about the Absolute" (115-6). Dewey's deciphering of the significance of the metaphysical theories of others was, in another  burlesque image, accomplished with the aid of a "Captain Midnight secret decoding ring that he received in the mail for sending in four box tops from <span class="SpellE">Ovaltine</span>" (198).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">One might well pose as  sporting<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> a "'Kiss me: I'm a <span class="SpellE">Deweyite</span>' button in the parade up Fifth Avenue on John Dewey Day" (16) while seriously claiming Dewey as one's "inspiration" and one's "ideal of what a human being should be" (10). But how seriously one can speak of the morally beneficial effects of a philosopher's writing while in the next breath confiding that "Ever since I first read John Dewey, which was in my  first philosophy class in 1950, I have firmly believed that if I would place  one hand on my copy of his <i style="">Experience and Nature</i>, opened or unopened, it didn't matter, and the other where it hurt, I  would be cured" (<i style="">ibid</i>.)? Readers will have to sort out for themselves when Gale is speaking with tongue in  cheek.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">What tension there is between expressions of respect and ridicule is eased somewhat by the fact that  Gale's admiration is directed more toward the philosophic position that results  from the critical pruning and grafting that he recommends. Indeed the second  half of Gale's book is directed toward liberating the <span class="SpellE">metaphysicolholic</span>, whom he sees lurking in Dewey's corpus and for whom he evidently feels considerable sympathy. Gale himself regards metaphysics as "an intrinsically rewarding activity" (134). He maintains that the attempt  to proscribe it is, because "there is no agreed decision-procedure for resolving disputes between metaphysicians, . . . an act of cultural  barbarism analogous to someone who burns down the Louvre because no  decision-procedure can be produced to determine when a painting is good (133).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Accordingly Gale argues that  his subject is committed to a metaphysic of pure experience that is barely  distinguishable from the absolute idealism of Dewey's early period (163). There is, Gale observes, "a limited and an all-inclusive sense of 'experience'" (<i style="">ibid</i><span class="GramE">.;</span> cp. 123). The former is the "ordinary common sense experience that results from the interaction of a human organism with its environment" (<i style="">ibid</i>.), and the latter is a <span class="SpellE">Plotinian</span>-Hegelian  (162) "Absolute, the only true individual, with everything emanating out of it" (163).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This, Gale acknowledges,  "goes well beyond the letter of Dewey's text" (<i style="">ibid</i>.). Indeed Dewey repudiated the idea that the inclusive notion of experience required an <span class="SpellE">entitative</span> interpretation (its  own "subject matter") as well as William James's notion of pure experience (167),  which informs the doctrine Gale wants Dewey to embrace. (Gale refers to this  as a <span class="SpellE">Milesian</span> understanding of pure  experience because of the tradition that Thales distinguished two types of water, that which we  drink and the metaphysical water that serves as the underlying stuff of all  changes (166).) Dewey's resistance to these doctrines "is not decisive, for in general, an author does not have a privileged authority with regard to  the proper interpretation of his text" (167).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a><o:p></o:p></sup></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Gale, moreover, regards as  absurd (167) Dewey's effort to avoid an "<span class="SpellE">entitative</span> interpretation" by <span class="GramE">claiming</span> "'experience for philosophy is method, not distinctive subject matter' (LW 1: 371)"  (164). A charitable interpretation of this claim would be to take it as the  principle that whatever we represent to ourselves is conditioned by our  experience. That means that we cannot offer a privileged description of the  "world-as-it-is-in-itself apart from its relation to men" (124). The alternatives to this are not limited solely to "a description of man-in-the-world" (philosophical anthropology, <i style="">ibid</i>.) Many of our inquiries focus on aspects of the natural world that do not include  human beings. The methodological principle that Dewey sees as embodied in his inclusive notion of experience merely cautions us not to forget that the descriptions we come up with, even in these cases, are conditioned by  our physiology, technology and the forms of representation that our culture  makes available to our imaginations. It is this rather than any <span class="SpellE">verificationist</span> principle that lies behind Dewey's <span class="SpellE">metaphilosophical</span> hostility to traditional metaphysics.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Gale recognizes that embedded  in Dewey's late-career venture into metaphysics is a form of "transcendental deduction argument" (131, cp. 159). To be sure, some of Dewey's suggestions about the categories appropriate to the description of  experience -- e.g., his "event ontology" -- are even less convincing than Kant's attempt to justify his categories in terms of the forms of judgment that  are needed to make self-conscious experience possible. From the premises  that (1) human experience is a natural phenomenon (naturalism), (2) what is in  experience is a feature of reality (naive realism), and<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b>(3)  experience is structured by inquiry (which is a response humans make to what they experience as  precarious, uncertain and incomplete), it is not at all implausible to argue to the conclusion that what elicits inquiry are features of the natural world  every bit as real as the stable, fixed and complete. <b style=""><i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></b></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This argument would in Kant's  terms (first <i style="">Critique</i> A296/B353) be transcen<i style="">dental</i>, leading us by reflection on experience to the features that must structure it, not to features that are transcen<i style="">dent</i>, features of some generalized object of experience: reality-as-it-is-  in-itself apart from its relation to human experience. Given that the influence of  Kant on Dewey is every bit as pronounced as that of Hegel (to which Gale  repeatedly alludes), it would be fairer to read Dewey as sharing Kant's hostility  to "dogmatic metaphysics" and engaged in a species of what Kant would call "critical metaphysics." In that case it is totally inappropriate to father on  Dewey any account of reality-as-it-is-in-itself, let alone one that amounts to monistic Absolutism.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Dewey's commitment to  monistic Absolutism follows, according to Gale, from a principle that he dubs the  "Humpty-Dumpty Intuition": "It is impossible for numerically distinct individuals to stand in any direct non-mediated relation, such that, for example, one temporally succeeds, perceives, knows, or causes the other" (23), where  by 'numerically distinct individuals' Gale means "entities that exist separately and independently of each other" (159). Dewey may have been committed to a principle of this sort in his early period, but the  textual evidence Gale offers from <i style="">Experience and Nature </i>to show that Dewey continued to adhere to the principle  (162-3) will appear convincing only to readers who, like Gale, are unable to  recognize the passages cited as expressions of Dewey's own brand of critical  methodology.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Following this method leads  us to see that our representations of reality -- of natural phenomena that include  human experience -- are products of inquiry, the activity that structures (continually reconstructs) experience. Improvements in those products  may well introduce distinctions between things that can exist independently of  one another as well as lead us to recognize that things we previously  thought were capable of independent existence are in fact internally related. When  the products of different inquiries conflict, or simply fail to relate  intelligibly to one another, we are confronted by further stimuli to inquire in an  effort to reconcile our representations. There is no need, and it would be wholly inappropriate to assume here, that experience in all its diversity is  really a manifestation of some unitary absolute.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Gale treats Dewey's account  of inquiry with deference (29) except for the thesis that "an adequate resolution  of a problem is . . . based on the transformation of some ineffable  property of a situation into another ineffable property having just the sort of  unification that was lacking in the former" (41-2).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup> Gale nevertheless believes that Dewey's enthusiasm for inquiry amounts  to the fanaticism that holds, "there cannot be enough of a good thing" (18). He attributes to Dewey, and offers reasons for <span class="GramE">rejecting,</span> both the doctrine that we always inquire (67-8) and that we ought always  to inquire (69, 81-4).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Why one might need to urge us  to do what we always do anyway can be made plausible by interpreting 'inquiry' more narrowly in the normative claim. What Dewey is urging us to do is to  take active control of the responses we naturally make to problematic  situations and apply deliberately our cultural resources of symbolic representation to  aid in transforming an indeterminate<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup>  problematic situation into one that is "determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations" (LW 12: 108). What even a non-symbol using organism will  do in the face of a problematic situation is reconstruct its habits of  response (cf. Dewey's account of the infant and candle in his treatment of the reflex-arc concept EW 5: 97 ff.), and it appears that humans are prone  to respond at this level and not to bring all available cognitive resources  to bear -- i.e., to inquire in the <span class="SpellE">favored</span>  sense -- when involved in problematic situations. Gale reports that Thomas Alexander  and Tom Burke held that even non-conscious individuals engage in forms of  response ("proto-inquiry") when faced with forms of problematic ("<span class="SpellE">tensive</span>") situations  that are continuous with inquiry in the <span class="SpellE">favored</span> sense. Late in his book (179) Gale acknowledges that this interpretation  rests on an application of Dewey's principle of continuity, but Gale earlier  declined (70) to adopt the generous reading of 'inquiry' when criticizing Dewey's  "false assumption that we are always inquiring" (71).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Gale's argument to the effect  that it is a bad idea to apply conscious inquiry in all problematic situations --  in particular to interpersonal relations -- rests entirely on one anecdote relating Sidney Hook's apparent failure to inquire and another  purporting to illustrate the folly of thinking carefully, rather than following gut  feelings, when it comes to affairs of the heart (81-2). Gale throughout treats  emotion and cognition as independent and often opposed, when it is clear even in  Dewey's early writings (e.g. EW 4: 152-188) that emotion and cognition are  intimately related. This approach lends itself to a positivist framework of  interpretation -- what is devoid of cognitive content has only emotive significance --  and Dewey, who rejected the positivists' emotive theory of ethics, is said  to have embraced their emotive theory of metaphysics because he believed that metaphysical claims are unverifiable (116-7).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Another positivist dualism,  which informs Gale's reading of Dewey, is a sharp distinction between, on the one  hand, conceptual connections and, on the other, connections variously  described as "causal" (11, 171), "empirical" or "contingent" (32, 171). Dewey can't, Gale insists (171) treat the relationship between organism and  environment as both "necessary conceptual" and "causal contingent." But it is surely not unreasonable to expect that under inquiry the status of connections will shift classification and the classifications themselves  will blur. We may not have found that the atmosphere of our planet is  dependent on creatures with lungs in the way that creatures with lungs are dependent  on the atmosphere (174), but it has recently emerged that the composition of  the atmosphere has been profoundly affected by the presence of plants -- see  Oliver Morton, <i style="">Eating the Sun</i>, London Fourth Estate, 2009, pp. 242-54.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The status of the (under  Gale's interpretation) crucial Humpty-Dumpty principle is likewise handled in positivist fashion. To claim the principle can be verified by "our gross experience, being a manifest feature of all our perceptual experience" would be "another instance of Dewey's fake empiricism" (192; cf. 168):</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">When  I see a chair next to a table, for example, I don't see them emanating out of some <span class="GramE">background</span> unity, nor do they appear to be  interdependent parts of some organic unity. Each has its own distinct individuality  that is completely independent of the other (192-3).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Indeed Dewey, whose  experience rests on <span class="GramE">a similar</span> sediment of  successful inquiries, would doubtless see these two pieces of furniture in the same way.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">But having convinced himself  that the Humpty-Dumpty intuition is indispensable to Dewey's account of  the-world-as-it-is-in-itself, Gale sees only one way properly to secure this principle. By virtue of acknowledging that significant aspects of experience, 'immediate  experience' -- in particular the experience "of unification through active control of a physical medium" (43) that brings satisfactory closure to inquiry -- cannot be represented conceptually, cannot be given articulate  expression, and are therefore ineffable, Dewey, is thereby committed to a form of  'mysticism'.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Dewey, however, staunchly  insisted that mystical experiences "lack any cognitive or <span class="SpellE">noetic</span> value" (201); like other ineffable aspects of experience they may be  "had" but they cannot without reconstruction through inquiry be "known". Gale quotes Dewey (from LW 9: 26): "<span class="GramE">'As</span> with every empirical phenomenon, the occurrence of the state called mystical is  simply an occasion for inquiry into its mode of causation'" (202-3). Nevertheless, if no evidence of the Humpty-Dumpty intuition is available through the influences of the world on our five senses, Dewey is forced, Gale  insists, to recognize a cognitive species of mystical experience that will provide  evidence (199) for the principle that underwrites the metaphysics he longed for,  even if he did not espouse it.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The <span class="SpellE">Prometheanism</span> of Gale's subtitle represents Dewey's commitment to an image of human  beings as active, especially when engaging the world with their cognitive  faculties. Given that Gale's interpretation is framed throughout by assumptions  that were prevalent in the mid-twentieth century and resulted in the eclipse of  Dewey's influence, it is not altogether surprising that his efforts to marry Dewey's <span class="SpellE">Prometheanism</span> to a mysticism, which "requires that  the subject overcome her Promethean proclivities, [and] become passive" (19) results in a <span class="SpellE"><i style="">reductio</i></span><i style=""> ad absurdum</i> rather than a coherent interpretation of Dewey's philosophy.</span></p>    <div style="">

The intrusive 'of' is one of three misprints I noticed. "Greta Gabor" should read "Greta Garbo" (104), and "it is logically possible there exist an <span class="SpellE">unthought</span>  of object" should read "exists" (166). The following seem to be failures of copy editing rather than misprints: "Often my criticisms . . . will have a rigor, precision, and clarity . . . thereby belying [betraying?] <span class="GramE">my</span> background as a so-called analytic philosopher" (17); the second occurrence of 'Tiles' on p. 181 should read '<span class="SpellE">Boisvert</span>' and the index entry for 'Tiles' (214)  modified accordingly.</span></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[2]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> In his second chapter, which is devoted to Dewey's theory  of art and esthetics, Gale insists on the need for criteria, to determine when esthetic experiences that are occasioned by a work of art are linked to  it in appropriate ways. He suggests "It is because we think the ideas, intentions, meanings, and feelings, yea the very mind and spirit, of the original creator imbue or become incarnate in the created product or  work" (57) that creators of works of art have an authority over the  appropriateness of responses to their works that philosophers apparently lack. Given the similarity between the value of metaphysical theories and works of art  -- the "cultural barbarism" of rendering traditional metaphysics illegitimate being tantamount to burning down the Louvre, since like art "the only justification for metaphysics is metaphysics, it being an intrinsically rewarding activity" (134) -- one might find puzzling the greater  authority over the understanding of their work that is accorded to artists.</span></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[3]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> Related to this is Gale's claim that Dewey made a big  mistake in treating the situations that initiate inquiry as ineffable, as this  renders collective inquiry impossible (30, 34-5). To begin collective inquiry,  however, people simply need to share the feeling of confronting a problematic  situation; the first step in the inquiry will be to agree on a description of what  the problem is -- characterizing a problem is, after all, often the most  important step toward resolving it.</span></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[4]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> As part of showing that Dewey is committed to monistic  Absolutism Gale offers an argument that Russell "lazily failed" (188) to supply  arguments<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b>in support of the claim that every problematic situation is identical to  every other. The argument neglects to take seriously Dewey's characterization  of problematic situations as 'indeterminate' and freely applies the law of excluded middle to identity statements about such situations, "Either U1  = U2 or it is not the case that U1 = U2" (<i style="">ibid</i>.).</span></p>  </div>  </div>
