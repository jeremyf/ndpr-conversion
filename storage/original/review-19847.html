	 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">Despite <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span>  professed atheism, there are a number of ways that his philosophy can be related  to theology. The value of <span class="SpellE">Depoortere's</span> book is  that it is not simply a survey but a constructive engagement with <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> thought, centered on his set-theoretic ontology. This value, however, is  also a limitation, because <span class="SpellE">Depoortere's</span> overall  engagement is somewhat idiosyncratic and incoherent, as I will discuss below. After  an introduction that provides helpful context for reading <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> in terms of Christian theology, the rest of the book consists of three fascinating but uneven chapters. The body of the book represents an  attempt to articulate, justify and defend a proof of God's existence in both  traditional <span class="SpellE">Thomistic</span> and modern  set-theoretical terms, over against <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span>  atheistic interpretation of set-theoretic ontology.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU"><span style=""> </span>In the introduction, <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> defines modernity  as "<i style="">a passion for the new</i>" that has been compromised by the failure of political utopian projects (1). Christianity, particularly as seen through contemporary accounts of Paul  by Žižek, <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span>  and others, offers "the prospect of a new kind of revolutionary subject" (9). <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> thought is important because it "offers us clues for 'saving' the (Christian) passion for the new in our post-revolutionary age" (21). But this passion for the new and this renewed Christian subjectivity are  drawn up into a new proof for the existence of God that takes place in very  traditional terms. <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> argues that the way for  theology to take seriously <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> philosophy is to  explore its usefulness for clarifying our concept of God, "which no longer has any clearly circumscribed meaning," so he defaults to the "historical consensus of classical theism" (23-24).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">Badiou</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU"> claims in his book <i style="">Saint Paul</i> that Paul gives us a new form of universal subjectivity, and this takes the  form of an event. <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> <span class="GramE">master-work</span>, <i style="">Being and Event</i>, develops a mathematical ontology of being qua being in order to articulate how an  event subtracts from being in a way that cannot be strictly formalized. If the  event is what offers the promise for a revolutionary subjectivity, why does <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Badiou</i></span><i style=""> and Theology</i>  ignore the event in favor of a sustained exposition of <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span>  set-theoretic ontology? <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> intervenes into and  upon <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> ontology in order to shift the  terms of the debate from a decision for atheism to a decision for theism, and this is a  striking and significant intervention. But the idea of the event completely drops  out of the purview of <span class="SpellE">Depoortere's</span> discussion,  which is also significant. The majority of this book consists of a constructive philosophical-theological-analytic project: what is <i style="">new</i>  is adopting the perspective of set-theoretic ontology to update Aristotelian and <span class="SpellE">Thomistic</span> arguments for  God's essence and existence. Set theory as elaborated by Cantor replaces <span class="SpellE">Aristotelianism</span> in supplying a philosophical  ontology to ground a neo-Thomistic theology. This constructive project is also  problematic, however, because it still relies on fundamentally Aristotelian  oppositions, mainly that of actual vs. potential, and because it ultimately depends  on a leap of faith from the possibility of God as absolutely infinite to the actuality of this absolute infinite's existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">Before explaining what is at stake in <span class="SpellE">Depoortere's</span> intervention, and why I think it is  ultimately incoherent, I will briefly survey the three chapters that follow the introduction. Chapter 1, "Faith and the Existence of God," lays out definitions and "terminological clarifications" that predetermine the encounter with <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> work. <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> argues, against many modern humanist understandings, that faith has a supernatural origin and depends on the existence of God to be faith. <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> relies strongly on the <i style="">Summa  <span class="SpellE">Theologiae</span></i> of Aquinas, the statement of Vatican I on <i style="">Dei <span class="SpellE">Filius</span></i>,  and contemporary Roman Catholic theologians such as Avery Dulles for this conclusion. <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> wants to resist the possibility of any faith that does not require  belief in the existence of a traditional theistic God, and here he agrees with <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span>: "I want to side with <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> and hold on to a strong understanding of both religion and faith, an understanding which implies that neither can be <i style="">true</i> if  God does not exist" (36). <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> claims that God does not exist, and therefore religion and faith are impossible. <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> takes this challenge seriously, sharpening the edge of the either/or, but he offers an  alternative argument that God does exist. <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span>  understands the hermeneutical nature of faith, but he says that this circle is a  closed circle, and "the only way to escape from this closed circle is to prove the existence of God <i style="">without</i> presupposing faith" (38). This attempt to prove the existence of God by means of set theory without presupposing subjective faith is the  implicit thesis of the book, and the payoff of theology's encounter with <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">Chapter 2, "<span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> on Being," carefully and clearly lays out the mathematical basis of set theory that informs <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> <i style="">Being  and Event</i>. This chapter is extremely valuable, because many thinkers concerned with themes of religion and theology avoid the  intimidating mathematical formalization that predominates in <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> masterwork. <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> gives us an  impressive, sensitive and difficult reading of set theory in general, and <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> mathematical ontology in particular. What  <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> makes clear is that <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> approaches the limits of philosophical speculation and mathematical formalization and makes a decision: in order to exclude paradoxical sets  (sets that are not members of themselves), <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span>  rejects the idea of the one that would harmonize these incompatible sets into  any consistent multiplicity. Rather, by affirming the multiple as multiple, <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> ontology "is thus the thinking of  'inconsistent multiplicity'" (64). Inconsistent multiplicity cannot be thought as such but provides the "'ungraspable horizon of being'" (64). In order to formalize or <span class="SpellE">axiomatize</span> set theory into a  consistent mathematical theory, one must rule out the possibility of paradoxical  sets. According to <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span>, and affirmed by <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span>, "this has resulted in a laicization or secularization of the infinite in which there is neither need nor place  for God" (65). Why? <span class="GramE">Because what ultimately exists is being  qua being, which is inconsistent multiplicity.</span> In order for something to  exist for us, we must subtract from this original multiplicity and count some  multiple as one in order to construct a stable situation of knowledge. The procedure  by which one "counts as one" is the void or the null set, which makes it possible to suture presentation to what is presented. The void names the original multiplicity of being, and the link that allows one to present  what is ultimately unpresentable. Without any overarching one, there can be no  God who exists above or beyond the multiplicity in any traditional form.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">In order to 'save' God, <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> reverts back to Cantor's original presentation of set theory, and his development of the idea of transfinite numbers. Cantor relies on the  idea of "well-ordered sets" to suggest that we can count numbers higher than infinity, such as infinity plus one, infinity plus two, etc. (84). The mathematical  manipulation of numbers greater than infinity, or transfinite numbers, involves an understanding of numbers as ordinal (ordering, consecutive) rather than  as cardinal (that is, as representing some objective real measurement).  Then the question arises about the real status of these transfinite numbers: are  they actual infinities or just possible infinities? Do they point toward and  are they limited by an absolute infinity, or are they just endless? Cantor  accepts the axiom of infinity, which "declares that a limit ordinal exists," or that such transfinite numbers themselves eventually come to an end  (88). <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span>, on the other hand, rejects  both the axiom of infinity and the continuum hypothesis that is often associated with it.  The continuum hypothesis suggests that numbers are really related in a  well-ordered hierarchy, but this hypothesis cannot be proven true or false within the context of the standard <span class="SpellE">Zermelo-Fraenken</span> <span class="SpellE">axiomaticization</span> of set theory. So this  fundamental <span class="SpellE">undecidability</span> provokes a  decision: from <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span>, for the void and  against the one as absolute infinity; from Cantor, for the absolutely infinite as actually existing,  which according to <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> means the  mathematical form of a theological re-instantiation of God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">The final chapter, "Theological Evaluation of <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> Ontology," draws out this distinction  between Cantor and <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> and provides a perspective  from which to make such a decision concerning the actually existing infinite.  For Cantor, inconsistent multiplicity<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">comes</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU"> <i style="">at the end</i>, so to speak, <i style="">at the limit</i> of  his mathematical <span class="SpellE">endeavors</span>. There, where  the count-as-one fails, one bumps into the absolute. For <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span>, in contrast, inconsistency is primary; it is "the nothing that precedes the count-as-one (115).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">Inconsistent multiplicity in mathematical terms  means the limit of our understanding, for Cantor. Cantor decides for God as  the limit of this inconsistent multiplicity based on his assumption that there can  be no potential absolutely infinite without it being <span class="GramE">actual</span>. <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> cuts off this assumption by beginning  with inconsistent multiplicity and claiming that there is no limit. According  to <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span>, there is no mathematical  solution to this dispute. Mathematics can think a potentially existing absolute infinity,  but "there is no place for an actually existing absolute in mathematics" (118). <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> is correct to point out that <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> claim that set theory necessarily excludes the absolute infinite goes  too far; it is an interpretation or decision by which <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> opts for the void as opposed to the absolute infinite. Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> discusses an essay by Kenneth <span class="SpellE">Reynhout</span>, which argues that one can read <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> theory of the void in terms of negative  theology, where the null set 㼀 is the sign of <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span>  "hidden God." But this negative theological understanding of set theory and <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> is not sufficient for <span class="SpellE">Depoortere's</span> aims. <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> concludes the book with a  very condensed argument for a traditional God understood in set theoretical  terms as absolutely infinite by referring to a book by Rudy Rucker, <i style="">Infinity  and the Mind</i>. Rucker suggests, by means of the "reflection <span class="GramE">principle</span>," that there is a positive  connection between transfinite numbers and the absolute infinite. This connection  provides <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> an opening to declare that we can  preserve the traditional <span class="SpellE">knowability</span> and  unknowability of God in modern mathematical terms, and therefore "it remains possible to  break out of the closed circle of faith presupposing faith" (126).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">There are at least two problems with <span class="SpellE">Depoortere's</span> conclusion. He is too smart not to  qualify the situation of set theory about the infinite and he stresses its  indeterminacy. The fact that <span class="SpellE">Badiou</span> opts for the void and  for atheism means that it is possible to go back and follow Cantor's preference for  God as actually existing infinite. The fact that this situation forces a  decision, however, is not only problematic in terms of <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> ontology; it means that <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> is forced  back into the closed circle that he was hoping to avoid by offering a proof  of God's existence. The decision for God is at the same time a faithful(l)  decision, which means that there is no way out of the hermeneutical circle, at  least in terms of how <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> constructs it in his  book. Second, <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> relies strongly on the <span class="SpellE">Thomistic</span> and ultimately Aristotelian distinction  between actual and potential to decide for God, whereas this traditional  opposition may not make as much sense in terms of modern set theory or contemporary  philosophy and theology. The most <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> is able to  gain from his <span class="SpellE">Cantorian</span> mathematical set theory  is the <i style="">possibility</i> of an absolute infinite. He then falls back on Aristotle and Aquinas, as very briefly presented  through Rucker, to argue that the possibility of an absolute infinite implies an  actual absolute infinite, and to suggest that the existence of transfinite  numbers gives us positive knowledge of this actual infinite. But it is clearly a  leap of faith to presume that the absolute infinite is reflected in  transfinite numbers. Finally, <span class="SpellE">Depoortere</span> is forced to  equivocate in terms of this possibility of an absolute infinite, because he needs  the absolute infinite to be possible in order to counter <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> atheism, but he needs to overcome the limit of this possibility in order  to achieve his purpose, which is to prove the actual existence of God,  which is the only way to avoid the closed circle of faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <span style="line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-AU">The fact that this book is flawed and cannot achieve what it sets out to do does not diminish its value as a work of  theological engagement and theoretical reflection. It does not exhaust the possible  or actual relations between theology and <span class="SpellE">Badiou's</span> philosophy, but it is a serious and provocative encounter that is worth  much more than the countless surveys and superficial appropriations that  generally constitute the genre.</span>
