	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This is a superb book. It  takes Wittgenstein at his word, seriously acknowledging that his strictures on  how to do philosophy cohere with how he did philosophy. If, as is usually  adumbrated, Wittgenstein enjoined us, as philosophers, not to formulate  philosophical theses but rather to unearth the linguistic misunderstandings that give  rise to philosophical troubles, then consistency demands that his own  philosophical writings were not a roster of theses -- with attendant explanations,  arguments, justifications, and elaborations -- but a working out of that same methodologically constrained program. <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span>,  accordingly, identifies the essential elements of such philosophical manners and  illustrates their application in a textual reading of Wittgenstein's words on two quintessential <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> issues: rule-following/private language and the philosophy of mathematics.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">It seems that we are  constantly inundated with <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span>  interpretation. Every year tens of books are published on Wittgenstein or on ascribable <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> themes. However, one can  distinguish between publications that <i>use </i>Wittgenstein to further  philosophical agendas beyond pure interpretation and those that focus on  interpretation alone. That is to say, Wittgenstein and <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinianism</span> are seen -- legitimately, though sometimes exceedingly -- as offering an intellectual perspective that can provide interesting or novel insights  into linguistic, aesthetic, cultural, moral, and even political questions.  These works do, indeed must, rely on particular interpretations of  Wittgenstein's texts, but their objective is not the interpretation of Wittgenstein <i>per  se</i>. That endeavor, of achieving an understanding of Wittgenstein through an exclusively interpretative enterprise, is the one that is at the fore of  our current interest. Here we are witness to <span class="GramE">a diverse</span> panoply of interpretative policies and strategies. Some are very  text-oriented; others address Wittgenstein through contextual frameworks. Some alight  on one of several (the Early, Late, Middle, Third) <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteins</span>; others prefer a more general, or, at the least, developmental object of interpretation. Some engage with the diverse interpretative community;  others insist on independent readings. Some attempt to unearth the secrets and mysteries hiding behind Wittgenstein's formulations; others are more  explicitly literal. Some have an ideology, a not-so-hidden agenda of changing the landscape of interpretation (see "The New Wittgenstein"); others continue the "standard," perhaps no less ideological, traditional project of <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> interpretation.  And some take Wittgenstein at his word.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Who has ever taken  Wittgenstein at his word? And how? And what does it mean to take Wittgenstein at his word?  As <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> reminds us, there have been  prominent <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> interpreters who  have understood Wittgenstein's demands clearly -- that a philosopher must not amass  theses but should rather clear up misunderstandings of language through description  alone -- but have, while interpreting him, disagreed with such stipulations.  Two ways of disagreement can subsequently be recognized. One can, while in the interpretative mode, understand Wittgenstein's methodological strictures  but claim, as an interpreter of Wittgenstein, that he himself did not obey  them (as does Crispin Wright, <i>Wittgenstein on the Foundations of </i><i style="">Mathematics</i>, Duckworth, 1980). Or one can, while still in the interpretative mode, go a more convoluted route  and argue -- i.e., disagree -- with the restrictions, assess that  Wittgenstein himself is faithful to them, but nonetheless attempt to expose real philosophical truths in his writing (as does Michael <span class="SpellE">Dummett</span>, <i>The Logical Basis of Metaphysics</i>, Harvard UP, 1991). These  interpreters have understood him, but have not taken him at his word.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In his "The 'Middle  Wittgenstein': from Logical Atomism to Practical Holism" (<span class="SpellE"><i>Synthese</i></span> 87, 1991), David Stern, startlingly, seems to present us with a similar complication. He says: "I think it should be clear by now that we ought  to take Wittgenstein's rejection of philosophical theorizing, his lifelong conviction that philosophy is 'not a theory but an activity' seriously,  even if we don't ultimately take him at his word." What would it mean to take Wittgenstein's philosophical methodology seriously and still not take  him at his word . . . ultimately? Is Stern saying that although we "believe" Wittgenstein's intentions, although we are convinced that <i>he </i>believed not  only in his instructions for the philosopher but in his own fidelity to them, we are nevertheless permitted to continue in our traditional,  standard way of interpretation and look for philosophical positions and theses  (not just descriptions) in his work? If so, then we are not, ultimately, taking  him at his word.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Almost eerily, a recent book  (Duncan Richter, <i>Wittgenstein at his Word</i>, Continuum, 2003), presents a  related yet dissimilar ideology that is invested in doing <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> interpretation. Taking Wittgenstein at his word means, for Richter,  focusing on the therapeutic goals that Wittgenstein claims for (his) philosophy, and  he goes on to uncover such therapy in several <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> stations (including the less beaten, but absolutely appropriate, paths  of ethics and religion). One would have thought that <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> is bent on the same project, for he heralds his work with its central  question:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">What  kind of interpretation emerges if we adhere strictly to Wittgenstein's  methodological pronouncements, in particular, his claims that his aim is purely  therapeutic and that he is not in the business of presenting and defending  philosophical theses? (p. <span class="GramE">xi</span>)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">But, I hasten to add, therapy  as the definitive end of the philosophical method that he is soon to process  drops out of the picture right then and there. (I submit that therapy does not  again appear in the book; it is definitely not one of its index entries.) Instead of continuing to focus on therapy, <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span>  takes Wittgenstein at his word by performing two fundamental exercises: he  reads Wittgenstein as applying said methodology (of describing the use of  language in order to dismantle deep-seated misunderstandings) to two <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> themes; and he does so in Wittgenstein's words, by "assembling reminders," so to speak, i.e., by the precise technique that  Wittgenstein requires for doing philosophy.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-AU">* * * * * * * * * *</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Devoting the first of two  parts of the book to the <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> mantras "to  follow a rule" and "private language," <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> takes us, yet again, into the familiar sections of <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, Â§183-Â§315. Almost endearingly, he (a) gives credit  to all past readings of these themes that have intuited, mostly wrong-headedly,  the basic <span class="SpellE">problematics</span> of both subjects; and (b)  harks back to both his own previous reading of the issues and Saul <span class="SpellE">Kripke's</span> "<span class="SpellE">skeptical</span>" paradox and solution, skirting the now-unimportant contest of priority  between them, and repudiating both.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In chapter 1, the fulcrum of  the rule-following discussion is Wittgenstein's recognition of the problem  of interpretation as the central predicament in following a rule:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">This  was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because  every course of action can be made out to accord with the <span class="GramE">rule.</span> . . . It can be seen that there is a misunderstanding here from the mere  fact that in the course of our argument we give one interpretation after  another; as if each one contented us at least for a moment, until we thought of yet  another standing behind it (<i>PI</i> 201).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Wittgenstein uses the  proposed methodology of description to solve the problem: "What this shows is  that there is a way of grasping a rule which is <i>not </i>an interpretation,  but which is exhibited in what we call 'obeying the rule' and 'going against  it' in actual cases" (<i>PI </i>201). The essential trait of following a rule  is that we follow it <i>de facto</i>. So essential is it that <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> creates a new, somewhat less than articulate, term -- <span class="SpellE"><i>defactoism</i></span> -- to conveniently label his and, most importantly, Wittgenstein's  solution. The label needn't be defined but is rather a typically <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> amalgam: we undergo training in our community as part of our natural  history, training is dependent on our natural human responses, rules that we are  trained to follow are a function of our society, and there is no intermediary  (mental or other) third-man between expressions and their applications. That is  to say, the solution to the problem lies in recognizing a curious mix of <span class="SpellE">communitarianism</span> and naturalism. Furthermore, and  still in typically <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> ambience, <span class="GramE">rule-following</span> is ineffable and rules are mundane.  (This has the added value of hinting at illuminating contrasts between the early  and late Wittgenstein: mundane rules are distinct from sublime logic and a strict insistence on consistency gives way to a more tolerant approach later.)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The second chapter, still in  Part I, houses the move to a treatment of the private language issue (obviously  not the private language <i>argument</i>), which follows naturally upon the rule-following deliberations but is nevertheless unanticipated. Arguing  with his own earlier reading again, <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span>  maintains that <i>grammatical</i> reflections on rule-following and more precisely the recognition of the grammar -- i.e., the rules of use -- of private rule-following lead to a drastically different question about private  language than the one investigated in traditional readings. Our inquiry no longer revolves around the possibility of a private language but is rather  about its <span class="SpellE">imaginability</span>. When we make out  the grammar of first-person reports of sensations we realize that the very idea of "private language" is incoherent -- so one cannot even ask of its existence or non-existence.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Where is the "at his word"?  My own two paragraphs above have reported on <span class="SpellE">Fogelin's</span> words; <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> has reported on  Wittgenstein's words. Reportage is almost all there is to it, albeit with inevitable  explicatory accompaniments. <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> takes us through Wittgenstein's words, proving, so to speak, that "the paradox of interpretation is . . . a recurrent and central feature throughout Wittgenstein's later philosophy" (p. 19). From the early <i>Philosophical  Grammar</i> he recruits the tantalizing passage:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">If  someone asks me 'What time is it?' there is no inner process of laborious  interpretation; I simply react to what I see and hear. If someone whips out a knife at me,  I do not say 'I interpret that as a threat' (<i>PG I </i>9).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Appreciating this kind of  philosophical minimalism, in both doing philosophy and reading Wittgenstein aright,  leads indeed to the posit of <span class="SpellE">defactoism</span>, which is  closely aligned with the ineffability of <span class="GramE">rule-following</span>. Again, <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span>, speaking for Wittgenstein,  uses Wittgenstein:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">To  what extent can the function of a rule be described? Someone who is master of none, I  can only train. But how can I explain the nature of a rule to myself? <span class="GramE">. .</span> . Our disease is one of wanting to explain (<i>Remarks on  the Foundations of Mathematics VI </i>31).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The methodology continues to  serve him throughout his presentation up to an extreme, but anticipated  conclusion. Lest we succumb to ascribing to Wittgenstein a closing, bottom-line thesis --  not the consensual, traditional impossibility of private language, but even  its newly exposed incoherence -- <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span>  delivers the <i>coup de grace</i> in, or actually out of, Wittgenstein's words:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">[Could  we] imagine a language [where] the individual words of this language are to  refer to what can only be known to the person speaking<span class="GramE">;</span>  to his immediate private sensations? So another person cannot understand  the language (<i>PI </i>243).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Although we might intuitively  say yes, although we have all been primed, in the <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> context, to say no, Wittgenstein <i>does not give an answer</i> as to  the <span class="SpellE">imaginability</span> of a private language,  precisely because grammar does not allow one.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Part II evinces the same  methodological policy. Wittgenstein's thoughts, nay -- words, on mathematics are  presented with a similar agenda: to extract his philosophy of mathematics directly through his explicit remarks. Since these words on mathematics (which,  we now know, constitute over half of the oeuvre) are, when taken literally and  at face value, difficult to understand as a consistent whole, Wittgenstein's  seeming wavering on certain questions leaves <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span>  wavering too. Contrary to other interpreters holding dissimilar interpretative ideologies, however, there is no embarrassment here.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The three chapters of Part II  address the known staples of "Wittgenstein on mathematics," i.e., the status of mathematical expressions, the mysteries of mathematics, and logical inconsistency. Familiar <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span>  statements and positions -- anti-<span class="SpellE">platonism</span> (but also anti-conventionalism and anti-formalism), a mockery of the bombastic "mysteries" of mathematics, and a tolerance of inconsistencies even in mathematics -- are rolled out, now under the enlightening umbrella of  <span class="SpellE">defactoism</span>. Doing mathematics <i>de facto</i>  means putting applied mathematics before pure mathematics. It is when we go up the  path of pure mathematics and the philosophy of mathematics that we forget the  basic adjectival <i>use</i> of numerals and, tempted by the superficial similarity of the  syntax (not grammar!) of mathematical propositions and empirical propositions,  we dither between "mysterious" <span class="SpellE">platonism</span> and "ridiculous" formalism (p. 94). (Platonism usually wins the day since our ordinary context is, mistakenly perhaps, <span class="SpellE">platonistic</span>.) In  fact, it is not what mathematicians do, but what we say that they do  that merits Wittgenstein's derision. Or sometimes, in very poignant cases  such as Cantor's transfinite numbers, even mathematicians "rise up" to the call of the philosophy of mathematics and are enticed by the same  giddiness that lets us posit arenas of mathematics far removed from practical, de  facto mathematics. That is when we leave the rough ground, i.e., the contexts  of straightforwardly practiced -- finite -- mathematics, and assume that we  can play the same game in the unconnected milieu of infinite sets. But  viewing mathematical propositions as rules (subject to the same paradox of interpretation that haunts all rules) and placing these rules in a <span class="SpellE">defactoist</span> context shows that the <span class="SpellE">Cantorian</span> "paradise" is no paradise at all. Mathematics, in fact, according to Wittgenstein, can weather inconsistencies and <span class="SpellE">defactoism</span> is harnessed, yet again, to describe both ordinary and bizarre  situations in which we live with inconsistencies while the practical application of mathematical and logical language is called upon to make short shrift of venerable paradoxes. (<span class="SpellE">Grelling's</span> paradox  merely shows that certain adjectives cannot be used to refer to themselves, while the  Liar paradox is not pernicious but merely useless.)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">As before, in the  rule-following/private language chapters, Wittgenstein's words are taken seriously and paraded  before us as reminders of his strange (because so unconventional) stance on mathematics. "A child has got to the bottom of arithmetic in knowing how to apply numbers, and that's all there is to it" (<i>Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics</i>, p. 271). Should we need elaboration on  what he is aiming at, Wittgenstein supplies it explicitly, and <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> uses it literally: "One would like to say [that Cantor] introduces us to the mysteries of the mathematical world. <i>This </i>is the aspect  against which I want to give a warning" (<i>RFM II </i>40). And as before, where Wittgenstein does not tout an unequivocal single-minded position because  such a position would be under the purview of thesis-minded philosophers, <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> adopts a similar non-committal posture.  So although we reject <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">platonism</span></span>  when asking about mathematical objects, "This doesn't at all destroy <span class="SpellE">Frege's</span> argument; it merely shows there is  something fishy" (<i>LFM</i>, p. 145). Wittgenstein will not demolish <span class="SpellE">Frege's</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">platonism</span></span> by simply denying it, for as we have seen, denying a thesis means  accepting the grammar of its assertion and negation. He makes do with "fishy" while <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span>, to be consistent with his own  reading, ascribes an additional twist of "irony" to Wittgenstein's evasiveness. Continuing faithfully to follow this <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> attitude, <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> seems to be just as blasÃ©  about leaving or staying in our <span class="SpellE">Cantorian</span>  paradise:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">Disrupting  our complacency about applying the procedure of one-to-one correspondence to infinite sets . . . would interrupt the smooth flow of the story that  seemed to take us almost effortlessly from dancing couples to a hierarchy of ever-increasing infinities. Isn't that too bad? Well, yes, for people  fond of exotic places (p. 135).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Finally, most impressive  because so under-stated, is Wittgenstein's refusal, and <span class="SpellE">Fogelin's</span> acceptance of Wittgenstein's refusal, to condemn <span class="SpellE">Frege's</span> madman (a being whose laws of thought are contradictory to ours) --  again a refusal to take a clear stand. This is consistent with what <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> has done, with Wittgenstein, by taking Wittgenstein at his word: a  revolutionary dismantlement of our basic concepts that does not take a stand on that  which cannot be taken a stand on.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-AU">* * * * * * * * * *</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">I use the word  "revolutionary" with hesitation. Can one be a modest revolutionary? By taking  Wittgenstein at his word <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> answers in the positive.  Adhering to a revolutionary methodology -- and there is nothing more revolutionary  in philosophy than not advancing theses -- this book speaks <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span>. (I am put in mind here of Clifford <span class="SpellE">Geertz's</span>  comment that some anthropologists "have, wonder of wonders, been speaking Wittgenstein all along" [<i>Local Knowledge</i>, Basic Books, 1983], p. 24.) Doing so runs the risk of exposing one to ridicule. Indeed, as <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> recounts and as I can attest, there is  nothing more frustrating than presenting Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics to professional mathematicians. But although that may be the price of such  unusual work, it holds the added value of supplying a new, insightful reading of Wittgenstein even while it is based on and reminiscent of what we  already knew. The constant duality of movement between step-by-step textual detail and  deep, contextual holism throughout this book serves to shed light on the  exemplary <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> themes of private  language and mathematics, beyond merely interpreting them (since, as we've seen with <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span>, the paradox of interpretation is at the root of all our  misunderstandings). Methodology and content, then, are not divorced; instead, Wittgenstein's methodology becomes both the means and the end of <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> interpretation. Doing this, however, does not mean, as <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> thinks, "taking his methodological statements at face value." These mixed metaphors should be pried apart. Taking Wittgenstein at his word,  as <span class="SpellE">Fogelin</span> has done, is a far, far deeper  thing than taking him at face value.</span></p>
