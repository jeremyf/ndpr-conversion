	<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Robert Sokolowski, an eminent phenomenologist and a celebrated teacher, here offers us a strategic set of essays encapsulating his intellectual development over two decades.<span style="">  </span>And that is what makes the collection useful, for those of us who have known him for his writing in phenomenology, or (for me) his groundbreaking <i>God of Faith and Reason</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">, can learn from the dispassionate yet uncompromising way in which he follows reason to the limit in exploring the deliverances of faith.<span style="">  </span>Indeed, the witness he gives in critical exploration of faith stands in sober contrast to the multiple ways in which "religion" is employed ideologically in our world today, as in na√Øve appeals to "intelligent design."<span style="">  </span>For Sokolowski's work exhibits the contention central to the work itself:<span style="">  </span>that the avowal of a free creator leaves "natural necessities" quite intact.<span style="">  </span>One of these is, of course, the need for rational argument.<span style="">  </span>At the same time, however, the presence of a free creator can transform our intellectual strategies.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Indeed, the two-fold program of these essays -- and they cohere nicely into a program -- is stated thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The most systematic form in which philosophy has been achieved within Christian revelation has been the metaphysics of <i>esse</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> that was elaborated in the middle ages.<span style="">  </span>The divine perfection and glory were expressed as belonging to <i>esse per se subsistens</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">, which was also seen as the cause of all limited forms of <i>esse</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">.<span style="">  </span>I would suggest that philosophy can now perform another reflective and systematic role in regard to Christian faith.<span style="">  </span>It can clarify the manifestation of what is believed.<span style="">  </span>In doing this, it can draw on philosophical resources provided by phenomenology.<span style="">  </span>It would be possible to call such a form of Christian thinking by the term "phenomenological theology," but this expression is unwieldy in English;<span style="">  </span>I would propose instead terms like "the theology of disclosure" or "the theology of manifestation". (36)<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">So his move elucidating "the distinction" of creatures from creation, which relies crucially on the "the metaphysics of <i>esse</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> . . . elaborated in the middle ages," had already adumbrated this proposal of a fresh set of strategies for theology, by noting how this elusive distinction "emerges at the intersection of faith and reason."<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Indeed, we may see his use of the term "distinction," so central to phenomenology, as a philosophical conceit for treating the activity unique to <i>creation</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">:<span style="">  </span>"as that which defines how we are to understand God, how we are to understand the world, and how we are to understand the relationship between the world and God" (38).<span style="">  </span>Moreover, by employing "the distinction" in this way, he can show how "Creation is related to other [Christian] teachings in a way that is logically distinctive . . .<span style="">  </span>[for it] opens the logical and theological space for other Christian beliefs and mysteries" (38).<span style="">  </span>And "to pay attention, systematically, to [such] relationships . . .<span style="">  </span>is part of what I would like to call the theology of disclosure" (39).<span style="">  </span>So Sokolowski's use of phenomenology to elucidate his Catholic faith shades imperceptibly into his proposed "theology of disclosure," which is hardly inappropriate, since the umbrella term "philosophical theology" reveals that "philosophers of religion" who so identify themselves are in fact engaged in <i>theology</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">.<span style="">  </span>In so doing, Sokolowski displays the full range of reason required for "faith to seek understanding," thereby offering a trenchant challenge to "philosophers of religion" who egregiously introduce "God" without attending to the key role which creation plays in keeping such discourse from drifting into idolatry.<span style="">  </span>For any attempt to parse, say, human and divine action without attending to "the distinction" will invariably treat "God" as an actor comparable to humans, and so in effect be speaking of a god.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">What is so illustrative about Sokolowski's mode of inquiry is the deft way in which he displays how "the Christian understanding introduces a new horizon or context for the modes of possibility, actuality, and necessity" which characterizes philosophical elucidation, as it "distinguishes the divine and the world in such a way that God could be, in undiminished goodness and greatness, even if everything were not" (41).<span style="">  </span>Indeed, this is the metaphysical upshot of the axial teaching on free creation (shared with Jews and Muslims):<span style="">  </span>"the being of things is now questioned in a new setting," thereby "open[ing] the logical and theological space for other Christian beliefs and mysteries" as "this sense of Creation introduces a new slant on being, on what it is to exist, and on all the modalities of being . . .<span style="">  </span>[since] things are profiled not against the world and its elementary forces, but against not being at all" (41-2).<span style="">  </span>Put more contentiously, this means that philosophical theologians who operate self-consciously in a Christian tradition, cannot presume to employ the strategies of modal logic without asking how they might apply to <i>creatures</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">, and <i>a fortiori</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">, logical tools like the "existential operator," as in "there is such a person as god." Unless they want to settle for the lower case!<span style="">  </span>So much for Sokolowski's adroit challenge to current Christian "philosophy of religion," which seems quite innocent of "the distinction," introduced in his 1982 masterpiece <i>The God of Faith and Reason</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">.<span style="">  </span>The four initial essays (under "Faith and Reason") spell out this faith-inspired challenge in diverse contexts.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Section two presents "theology of disclosure" in five chapters under "Eucharist and Holy Trinity."<span style="">  </span>While these are expressly theological in subject and in tone, his "Revelation of the Holy Trinity: A study in Personal Pronouns" (Ch. 9) extends Aquinas' insistence that the processions of the trinity model the activity of creating by using them to illuminate what is distinctive about persons:<span style="">  </span>"the use of the term <i>I</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> reveals the person of the speaker in its actual exercise, its being-at-work as a person," which allows him to explicate his use of "the term 'an agent of truth' to say what a person is" (136-7).<span style="">  </span>The next section explores "the human person," as he has already asserted that "this sense of Creation . . .<span style="">  </span>also introduces a new slant on ourselves" (41-2).<span style="">  </span>Five illuminating perspectives show how faith can transform ordinary categories for persons.<span style="">  </span>The first explores the language of "soul and the transcendence of the human person" to suggest how "the material components of a living being are affected by the whole" (156) and especially transformed in spiritual beings, as he tries "to convey in an intuitive manner what we mean by spirit and its life" (157).<span style="">   </span>The following chapter details how "the word <i>person</i></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> functions in an unusual and interesting way," in that it does not "name a kind of thing," but is itself "a radically individualized term.<span style="">  </span>It expresses a singularity" (165-6), albeit a radically historical one.<span style="">  </span>Indeed, by illustrating the grammar peculiar to 'person' he will lead us through the intricacies of effecting grammatical speech to detail the "radical individuality of each person" (174) as well as our capacity for transforming relationships of friendship (177).<span style="">   </span>In proper Aristotelian fashion, he then turns to "the human person and political life," to show how a human who is inherently political "can be destroyed by rampant individualism no less than by totalitarian regimes."<span style="">  </span>Indeed,<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style=""> </span>liberal individualism harms the person slowly and silently through a notion of freedom as absence of any and all constraints on the individual's choice. . . .<span style="">  </span>thus the two seemingly different modern regimes both destroy the person. (196)<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The high point of this section explores "the Christian difference in personal relationships" (Ch. 13), where displaying the paradigmatic role which friendship plays in Aristotle as "the culmination of moral virtue" (206) allows him to underscore "the difference between the human being and the person" (207) to show how startling is Jesus' "invit[ing] us to friendship with him," thereby "introduc[ing us] into the truth of the relationship between Christ and the Father" (209).<span style="">  </span>Here again, it is free creation which sets up this startling about-face, for "the idea that we could be friends with the first principle of the universe is something that would sound like utter foolishness to pagan thinkers" (209).<span style="">  </span>So "the distinction" not only warrants yet more startling assertions, but <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">because Christ draws us into this form of friendship with God, it becomes possible for us to declare ourselves, to use the first-person singular pronoun in our relationship with God himself.<span style="">  </span>We can say 'I believe', or 'I love' . . .<span style="">  </span>not only before other people but also before and towards God. (209-10)<span style="">   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">This exploration permits an astute recasting of "natural law" which relates ethics with "philosophical and theological anthropology" (231) to allow quite traditional renderings of "natural law" to flower into "a deeper sense of goodness and virtue (as well as a deeper sense of evil and vice)" (232).<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The fourth and final section details the relevance of faith for practical reasoning, ranging from "the fiduciary relationship and the nature of professions" (Ch. 16) and "some phenomenological contributions" to religion in the practice of psychoanalysis (Ch.17), to more institutional reflections on "church tradition and the Catholic university" (Ch. 18) and "philosophy in the seminary curriculum" (Ch. 19).<span style="">  </span>These essays prove most fruitful in displaying Sokolowski's conviction that a properly trained philosophical mind can bring clarity to contentious issues, especially when tempered by a compassionate and caring spirit.<span style="">   </span>For that is what these essays display throughout.</span>
