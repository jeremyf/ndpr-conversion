	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This book is not, as the title suggests, a book  primarily about Scotus or the problem of universals, at least not insofar as these problems were historically treated by Scotus and his contemporaries.  There is no attempt to situate Scotus's solution to the problem of universals  within his historical setting or to differentiate his views from many of his contemporaries (there are occasional comparisons with Aquinas and a  brief mention of Avicenna, but nothing substantive), nor is there any  extensive attempt to situate Scotus's views on universals within his larger  philosophical framework. Rather, the book primarily uses Scotus's notions of common  nature and haecceity to address contemporary problems in mereology. As the  author himself admits in the opening line of his preface, "this <i style="">opuscule  </i>presents the research of my dissertation" on "Scotus, universals, and mereology" (p. ix). Thus, Bates's work is closer in intention to something like Eleonore  Stump's work on Aquinas than, say, Giorgio Pini's work on categories in Scotus.  As a whole, the book consists of five uneven chapters: 1) "Scotus <i style="">Recidivus</i>";  2) "On the Structure of Material Substance in Scotus' Metaphysics"; 3) "Substantial Natures: Neither Singular Nor Universal, but Common"; 4) "On Individuation by the Haecceity"; and 5) "Responses to Objections", chapters which I will evaluate in sequence (the chapters are uneven  insofar as the first chapter is more of an introduction and the last chapter reads  like an appendix).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Bates begins with a recognition of the  opposition to his project by such authors as J.P. Moreland, Hilary Putnam, and Quine,  viz., that Scotus is either unintelligible or that modern philosophy no longer  needs such things as substantial forms. However, in defending Scotus, the best that  Bates can offer is, in his own words, the claim that: "this monograph shall argue that there are some interesting things about which [Scotus] may  well be <i style="">right</i>. In particular, I argue his theory of common natures is a plausible candidate for answering various  contemporary problems about universals" (p. 2). Unfortunately, though, to claim that Scotus is merely 'interesting' or that he 'may be right' hardly  justifies the next 140 pages of dense, poorly edited, text. In the first section of  chapter one, which is probably the most lucid section of the work, Bates first  lays out various aspects to the problem of universals. In contrast to nominalism,  which denies that universals exist, Bates frames the problem of universals in  terms of the question, </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">How do we explain  resemblances between things? (p. 4)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In addressing this problem, Bates rejects the  approach of <i style="">semantic ascent</i>, taken by Quine, David Armstrong, and Michael Devitt, on the grounds that it does not  conclusively answer the problem one way or another, claiming that it is a false  friend for both the realist and nominalist. Instead, taking his starting point from Scotus, Bates argues that the proper way to answer this problem is by an  appeal to univocal causation. Quoting Scotus, he describes univocal causation  thus: </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">even if no intellect  existed, fire would still generate fire and destroy water. [1] <i style="">And  there would be some real unity of form between generator and generated</i>, according to which unity univocal generation would occur.  For the intellect that considers a case of generation [2] <i style="">does  not make the generation be univocal, but recognizes it to be univocal</i>. (p. 11)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Given the importance of univocal generation to  his solution to the problem of universals, Bates then turns, in the second  main section of chapter one, to address the issue of event ontology,  admitting that such a framework is foreign to Scotus's metaphysics. However, it is not  clear to this reader why Bates includes this section. He does say that event  ontology "is the received framework for answering metaphysical questions,  including the problem of universals," but immediately afterwards he adds that "I am addressing the problem of universals from within the framework of Scotus' metaphysics, outside the framework of event ontology" (p. 14). Yet, in spite of this proviso, Bates then spends the next five pages  discussing event ontology. Perhaps it is due to my own lack of familiarity with contemporary discussions of event ontology, but I found this entire  section puzzling. Besides the vexing question of why he includes this section at  all when he says otherwise, the next most troublesome aspect is the fact  that Bates takes ample space to define the term 'universal' (understandable given  the title of the book, but something that is fairly commonplace within  philosophy), yet does not at all define Aristotle's <i style="">idion </i>argument, which he invokes as though it were common knowledge. Bates  then finishes the chapter with a very brief section (less than a page and a  half) on Scotus's notion of a common nature as something that is neither  universal nor particular, but a <i style="">tertium quid</i>.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the second chapter, which consists of three subsections, Bates outlines "Scotus' picture of material substance" in terms of "prime matter and substantial form" (p. 23). In the first section, Bates argues that a broadly-conceived Aristotelian substance  ontology "better explains the fact of the persistence of continuants through  change and the loss of their parts than contemporary theories of four-dimensionalism" (p. 24). In this section, Bates correctly contrasts Scotus's conception of prime matter, which is an entity in its own  right, from Aquinas's conception of prime matter, which is pure potency without any existence on its own. In the second section, Bates defends the  Aristotelian position that there are substantial forms based 1) on the fact that  material substances have a greater unity than a heap has, and 2) on human  cognition of universals. Bates then finishes this chapter in the third section by  arguing that prime matter is really distinct from form. At this point in the  monograph, though, Bates's presentation of Scotus's position is distressingly thin.  There is no mention of the fact that for Scotus a material substance consists  of a plurality of substantial forms, or that the form of a living thing is  its soul, or that time and place for Scotus, as an Aristotelian, are not things or dimensions but rather accidental attributes that inhere in a substance.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the third chapter, Bates turns to Scotus's  famous teaching concerning common natures, namely that they are neither  universal nor singular. Borrowing heavily from Joseph Owens's article on this topic,  Bates contrasts Scotus's conception of the common nature with those of  Avicenna and Aquinas. He then lays out and defends Scotus's teaching that there are different degrees of unity: an individual has a numerical unity, whereas  a common nature has a less than numerical unity. Of course, if natures  have a unity and existence of their own, that raises the troublesome question: "Are common natures Platonic forms?", which Bates then deals with in a very brief (five page) second section of the chapter. </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In an attempt to explain why Scotus's common  natures are not Platonic forms, Bates makes two arguments. First, he claims that a  common nature never actually exists on its own apart from either its existence  when it is contracted to a singular or its existence in the intellect when it is universal. Of course, this raises the question of what it means to say  that the common nature has, or is, its own entity, since 'having an entity'  presumably means that it exists somehow. As far as I could tell, Bates doesn't provide  any textual support for this claim, nor does he try to reconcile how a  common nature has its own entity but never actually exists. So even though he previously tried to distinguish Scotus's position from Aquinas's, in the  end, the differences between the two philosophers seem to be merely verbal. Secondly, Bates argues that the community proper to a common nature is  not a necessary attribute but is accidental to it. What is necessary,  according to Bates, is the common nature's indifference to being either universal or singular. Once again, I could not find any textual support for such a  claim. One last problem with this chapter, and not a slight one at that, is  Bates's earlier claim that being is not univocal. Granted, in the context,  Bates's claim pertains to how being is not univocal with respect to a substance  and an accident, which is historically correct insofar as it pertains to  Scotus's early commentary on the <i style="">Categories</i>, but is highly misleading insofar as it pertains to Scotus's mature  thought.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the fourth chapter, Bates rehearses two of  Scotus's arguments in favor of haecceity as a principle of individuation. Both  versions take the form of a disjunctive syllogism and give the impression that  haecceity is an <i style="">ad hoc</i> principle. Bates summarizes one of the arguments thus (p. 87): </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">1. The common nature  is individuated either by negations, existence, accidents such as quantity, matter, or a haecceity. </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">2. It is not  individuated by negations, existence, accidents, or matter. </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">3. Therefore, it is  individuated by a haecceity.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Bates then spends the remainder of the chapter distinguishing Scotus's notion of haecceity from contemporary versions,  such as those by Robert Adams, Gary Rosenkrantz, Richard Swinburne, and David  Kaplan. One weakness of the chapter is Bates's claim that the accidents of  quantity and quality can exist on their own since "they are really distinct and separable from the substances in which they inhere" (p. 99). Presumably, such could be the case, at least for quantity, in the case of the  Eucharist, or in general given an appeal to God's omnipotence, but Bates fails to  provide any support for this assertion. Nor does he address the fact that if this  were true, then <i style="">ex hypothesi</i> the separability of the accidents would undermine his argument for rejecting accidents as a principle of individuation.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the final chapter, Bates address two  potential objections to his overall project that Scotus does have a mereological conception of substance: one from the hypothetical claim that a  substance cannot be reduced to matter and form, and a second potential objection  based on his "incarnational theology" (p. 126). In order to address the first objection, Bates denies that Scotus would hold the following claim: "Mereological wholes are nothing over and above their parts" (p. 126). To flesh out his claim, Bates turns to Scotus's notion of act and potency. In doing so, however, he makes the very puzzling, and  unsubstantiated, claim: "The matter and form of a substance, each being part of that substance, are each in potency to that substance, which stands as a  single act to them" (p. 132).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This last quotation, I think, best encapsulates  the difficulty I have with Bates's overall project: matter and form are not,  for Scotus, potential parts to a third thing. Granted, unlike Aquinas,  Scotus does think that matter has its own actuality, but as far as I can tell,  matter is still, for Scotus, in potency to form, which is its act. Stated another  way, matter and form are principles of a thing, either for its coming into  existence or for its existence, but they are not, for that reason, parts of a  thing. At times, Bates seems to be aware of this difficulty, e.g., when he  reflects on Aristotle's analogy of the syllable BA, which must have some immaterial aspect, or  order, in addition to its material elements (p. 129). But at other times, Bates  speaks of a formal cause as though it were reducible to an efficient cause (p.  36). Overall, I find Bates's knowledge and understanding of Aristotelian  physics in general, and Scotus's in particular, to be lacking. And while I commend  his overall interest in Scotus and his attempt to make Scotus relevant, if  his weak grasp of Scotus is any indication, then I doubt that contemporary  readers interested in mereology will be convinced by his arguments either.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">On a non-philosophical note, the book  desperately needed to be edited better. In the first chapter there is a paragraph on p. 14  that is reprinted verbatim on p. 51. In other places, there is an incomplete  sentence, a portion of a sentence duplicated (making no sense of the text), misuse  or questionable uses of Latin phrases (which is disturbing for a text on a medieval philosopher who wrote in Latin), books cited in the endnotes  that do not appear in the bibliography, incorrect page references in the index, a number of authors in the bibliography without a given name, and about a  dozen or so typographical errors.</p>
