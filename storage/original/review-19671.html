	 <span style="line-height: 115%;"><o:p></o:p></span>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Alan <span class="SpellE">Malachowski's</span> <i style="">The New Pragmatism</i> accomplishes its central goal, which is to introduce non-specialists to the work of <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span>, Putnam, and their forebears Peirce, James,  and Dewey. <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> nicely explains the main connections and points of difference between these figures, as well as  how their work has been received. Philosophers who lack detailed knowledge  of pragmatism could do worse than to begin with this relatively slim  volume, which reads quickly, neither bogging down under a load of technicalities nor over-simplifying the issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Malachowski</span></span><span style=""> urges adoption of the term "The New Pragmatism" (apparently coined by Cheryl <span class="SpellE">Misak</span>) to describe the work of  Putnam, <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span>, and their philosophical  co-workers, because, he says, the "neo" in neo-pragmatism implies inferiority to classical pragmatism. <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> sometimes called himself a neo-pragmatist, so presumably the rhetorical concern is not universal. Regardless, <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> treats Putnam, <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span>, and the classical pragmatists with equal  respect, which is not always the case in this philosophical arena. Quite often  scholars attached to Dewey are dismissive of <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span>,  or those impressed by Putnam have little time for James (this despite the fact  that <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> wrote admiringly of Dewey, as did  Putnam of James). <span class="SpellE">Malachowski's</span> unabashedly  pro-pragmatist stance enables him to analyze each figure's strengths and weaknesses charitably, and to  explain how less-than-nuanced criticisms -- for instance, those lobbed by  Russell against James -- have been readily accepted in some philosophical  circles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Fittingly, <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span>  roots his précis of the new pragmatism in classical pragmatism. James famously considers a squirrel spiraling  around a tree in order to avoid being seen by a man who is also spiraling around  the tree. The question is: Does the man go around the squirrel, or only  around the tree? James answers that it depends upon what we mean, in practical  terms, by "going around the squirrel." Answering the question in metaphysical terms causes greater intellectual problems than it solves (<span class="SpellE">e.g</span>, what is the intrinsic nature of "going around"?), while the difficulty is dispatched easily if we focus instead on the practical consequences  of various possible interpretations. Contemporary pragmatists are similarly concerned with the practical consequences of our beliefs, and similarly  opposed to attaching themselves in advance to any intellectual methodology.  Pragmatism, whether old or new, can seem intellectually squishy precisely because of  its refusal to issue a philosophical ukase, but its strength lies in this  very flexibility. Rather than maim the world into suitable shape for a  Procrustean metaphysics, pragmatism works to handle the world and human experience  in ways that produce the best long-term results.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Malachowski</span></span><span style=""> also considers the relationship between contemporary pragmatism and contemporary philosophy, in both its continental and analytic variants. Continental philosophers often find pragmatism too much like analytic philosophy, and analytic philosophers sometimes dismiss pragmatism in  the same terms used to deride continental philosophy. Contemporary pragmatism  occupies a middle place, making use of elements from both analytic and continental philosophy, while aligning itself fully with neither. Postmodern  philosophy provides one important example of this larger pattern. For instance,  both postmodernism and contemporary pragmatism eschew transcendental  arguments and essentialism, but pragmatists retain a more positive attitude than do <span class="SpellE">postmoderns</span> toward science, the Enlightenment,  and the possibility that our beliefs might (non-metaphysically) relate to the  real world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Malachowski</span></span><span style=""> presents the original pragmatist triumvirate -- Peirce, James, and Dewey  -- before showcasing <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> and Putnam. Charles  Peirce founded pragmatism, and his approach <span class="GramE">reflected</span>  his scientific and mathematical background. William James popularized  Peirce's ideas, or something like Peirce's ideas, given James' markedly more  humanistic orientation. (The difference, as is well known, led Peirce to <span class="SpellE">retitle</span> his account "<span class="SpellE">pragmaticism</span>," a  term he deemed "ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers.") Russell and Moore attacked James' conception of truth, and <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> makes a good case that these criticisms were based on misinterpretation.  Dewey emphasized the need for philosophy to reflect human concerns and to work  to ameliorate human problems. While he agreed broadly with Peirce that  science was an important center of inquiry, he also agreed with James that  philosophy errs when it abstracts from actual human interactions with the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Malachowski</span></span><span style=""> spends a significant portion of this book examining the development of <span class="SpellE">Rorty's</span> career. <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span>  at first looked to be a party-line analytic philosopher, then evolved into a  critic of analytic philosophy, and ultimately settled on pragmatism. Yet <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> shows how <span class="SpellE">Rorty's</span> transformations are less dramatic than they appear, and how his later commitments are already prefigured in his early work. <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> also provides an overview of critical reaction to <span class="SpellE">Rorty's</span> texts, including the objection that <i style="">Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature </i>doesn't argue against its conceptual  targets so much as it considers them historically contingent and hence disposable.  That same emphasis on contingency is present in <span class="SpellE">Rorty's</span> later full-blown (neo-<span class="GramE">)pragmatism</span>, but now  contingency is an <span class="SpellE">ineliminable</span> part of everything we  value, rather than a rationale for discarding old ideas. Our <span class="GramE">language, our communities, our selves -- all are</span> contingently generated;  nevertheless, we are committed to all three and to our conceptions of them because  they enable us to make sense of our experience. Throughout, as <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> notes, <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> presents his views without  arguing for them straightforwardly, but instead by showing how we might learn to see  them as attractive and useful. In other words, <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> justified pragmatism pragmatically. He also showed that he had learned  the principle James failed to observe: do not engage your opponents on their  own conceptual turf, unless you wish to be defined in alien and inhospitable  terms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Putnam, <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> notes, has had a career "much more conventional than <span class="SpellE">Rorty's</span>. As a result, his views have not been inordinately clouded or distorted  by the fog of public notoriety" (61). Putnam's more cautious appropriation of  pragmatism has made him more congenial to analytic philosophers, but also less  inclined to pursue his pragmatist tendencies to their ultimate implications.  Nevertheless, Putnam has urged such pragmatist attitudes as opposition to the notion  of a knowable mind-independent world and a repudiation of the fact-value distinction. He has also made clear his debt to classical pragmatism, particularly that of James and Dewey; elaborated on the pragmatism  implicit in work by <span class="SpellE">Quine</span> and Davidson (as did <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span>); and devoted considerable thought (as did  Dewey and <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span>) to democracy's importance  for enabling people to understand one another, and thereby to help solve one another's  problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">For roughly thirty years, <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span>  points out, <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> and Putnam explored the same terrain, yet were unable to reach philosophical accord. As <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> shows, these  seemingly intractable differences resulted more from opposed intellectual styles  than from opposed viewpoints. <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> was happy to  be affiliated with pragmatist ideas; Putnam remained skeptical. The former explored pragmatism's possibilities while the latter tended to test  them. Ultimately both approaches have their strengths. Putnam's more tentative  tone, for instance, made it possible for philosophers otherwise leery of  pragmatism to consider its merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Malachowski</span></span><span style=""> rounds out his discussion by showing contemporary pragmatism's  usefulness in other areas of study. For literature, pragmatism demonstrates that  inquiry need not be scientific to have merit. Literature not only is a distinctive  means of exploring the human experience, it also helps readers to understand the circumstances of the oppressed and can thus drive social change. In the  legal arena, pragmatism tries to obtain the best results for an actual  community, rather than leaving the law entrenched in abstract principles that may serve  few human interests. With respect to feminist theory, pragmatism can orient  discussion toward improving the situation of women and away from unproductive  conceptual debates. In education, pragmatism encourages schools to teach skills of open-minded inquiry and social cooperation. And so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Malachowski's</span></span><span style=""> overview efficiently surveys the relevant ground and closes with a bibliographical essay for those who want guidance on how to proceed  further. Even for those who have already proceeded further, <span class="SpellE">Malachowski's</span> coverage may provide occasional new insights concerning the connections  between the five major figures mentioned here and their reception in the  philosophical community. Three minor problems should be borne in mind, however. First, although <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> mentions pragmatism's <span class="SpellE">meliorism</span>, it deserves an even heavier emphasis. Pragmatism's optimistic contention that humans can improve their  situation and their knowledge is, for instance, one of the central features  differentiating it from postmodernism, but <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> does  not mention this. Second, even though this book is an introduction, the  reader would benefit from a more complete exposure to some of the concerns  sympathetic critics have raised against pragmatism. For example, <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> sometimes appears naïve about the way in which social structuring  affects our ability to differentiate real usefulness from what we have learned to  perceive as useful. Finally, <span class="SpellE">Malachowski's</span> insistence  on the term "The New Pragmatism" may be rhetorically off-putting to some readers, particularly given that it was not used by either of the two  notable "new pragmatists." <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> is devoted enough to the title that he forgets to consider the semantic  sensitivities of his subjects. <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> used "neo-pragmatism" without apparent concern that he would thereby generate a philosophical inferiority complex. But <span class="SpellE">Malachowski</span> writes,  <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: normal;"><span style="">The New Pragmatism no longer needs to keep reminding itself that it is a  form of 'pragmatism'; it can just get on with the job of exploring issues of interest. It is  for this reason that . . . <span class="SpellE">Rorty</span> often wrote  extensively without pausing to explicitly invoke the name of the New Pragmatism.  (58)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Perhaps, but it is dangerous work to speculate on the motives behind another person's linguistic  choices. The term does not please my ear, but for all that it may render  unforgettable the title of this well-executed book.</span></p>
