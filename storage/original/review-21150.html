	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This new collection of essays in Cambridge's <i>Critical Guides</i> series consists of first-rate commentaries by an  international group of scholars on various aspects of Kant's <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>. Overall, the essays provide careful readings of Kant's text, draw on his  other writings for context where appropriate, and analyze his claims and  arguments with clarity and philosophical acumen. As the subtitle indicates, these  essays are intended to provide a 'critical guide' to Kant's second <i>Critique</i>. Such a label brings with it a variety of possible expectations, and I  will consider which of these the collection seems best able to meet.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">One might expect that a critical guide to the  second <i>Critique</i> would make it a point to treat all major aspects of the work, and this collection <i>nearly</i> does so. The essays cover the following topics:  Kant's reasons for writing a second <i>Critique</i>, how best to understand the  notion of a 'formal principle,' the significance of the fact of reason, the development of Kant's deductions of morality and freedom from the <i>Groundwork for  the Metaphysics of Morals</i> to the second <i>Critique</i>, the  doctrine of the <i>Triebfeder</i> or 'spring' of pure practical reason, Kant's discussion of freedom and how to reconcile it with causal determinism,  the Antinomy of Pure Practical Reason and Kant's notion of the highest good,  the primacy of practical reason and the notion of a postulate in general,  and, finally, the importance and meaning of the Doctrine of Method. One major omission is a detailed discussion of the postulates, that is, Kant's  arguments (from a practical perspective) for the existence of God and the  immortality of the soul. Marcus Willaschek provides an excellent discussion of the  notion of a postulate in general, drawing on remarks from the first <i>Critique</i>  to specify its epistemic status and the sense in which it can legitimately  extend cognition, if only in a 'practical' sense. In addition, he reconstructs  and evaluates Kant's argument for the primacy of practical over theoretical  reason, which provides a general argument for belief in postulates independently  of their content. But, unfortunately, there is no discussion of the  specific postulates Kant describes or his claim that it is necessary to take them  to be true in order to will the highest good. So, while Willaschek's essay is  quite helpful, the collection overall might leave some readers wanting just a  bit more.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Since this collection is a <i>critical</i> guide  to the second <i>Critique</i>, one might expect to come away from these essays  with a sense for the various debates surrounding Kant's text. The essays vary  to the extent that they explicitly describe the critical landscape. Pauline Kleingeld's essay on what Kant means by calling the 'fact of reason' a <i>fact</i> provides a clear overview of the major interpretive positions taken by commentators on this issue. She argues in favor of a reading that  synthesizes and builds upon some of these approaches, and uses it to explain how  Kant might respond to common misunderstandings of his position. The other essays  tend not to situate their claims directly with respect to existing critical  debates. While all of the essays address secondary sources where appropriate,  none seem intended to provide a review of the recent literature.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Instead, this collection is best understood as a  critical guide to the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i> simply in the sense  that each essay proposes to lead the reader toward a better understanding of some problematic aspect of this text. For example, Stefano Bacin explains how  the Doctrine of Method fits within and contributes crucially to the general  project of the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>. Pierre Keller discusses  Kant's distinction between 'psychological' and 'transcendental' freedom,  evaluates his reasons as to why only the latter can be reconciled with the causal  determinism of the phenomenal world, and explains what Kant might mean by the  'noumenal' character that belongs to persons insofar as they are free. Andrews  Reath unpacks Kant's claim that a practical law must be a formal principle,  that is, one that determines the will through its form rather than its matter,  and applies his reading to reconstruct and clarify arguments in the early  part of the Analytic. Some essays draw on Kant's other writings to provide a  useful context for interpretation. Heiner Klemme examines a variety of letters  and other texts to discuss why Kant, after completing the <i>Groundwork for  the Metaphysics of Morals</i>, felt the need to write a second <i>Critique</i>. Jens Timmermann, in order to clarify Kant's position on the possibility  and need for a deduction of morality, discusses the extent to which Kant retreats  in the second <i>Critique</i> from certain claims regarding this issue made in  the <i>Groundwork</i>. Eric Watkins draws upon Kant's discussion of the Antinomies from the  first <i>Critique</i> to reconstruct Kant's argument for the Antinomy of Pure Practical Reason  found in the second.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Although the focus on explaining Kant's text  might seem to indicate that the essays are aimed at beginning students of the  second <i>Critique</i>, this is not always the case. The best essays in this collection manage  to provide enough discussion of the text so as not to be inaccessible to  those who are less familiar with it, while also evaluating its claims in a way  that should be interesting even to those already well-acquainted with Kant's  moral theory. Like good travel writing, these essays make you want to visit  the second <i>Critique</i> -- that is, to think about it for yourself --  even if you have explored it before. The commentators accomplish this by  interpreting and evaluating Kant's text in distinctive and philosophically compelling  ways. For example, in addition to reconstructing the argument for the Antinomy  of Pure Practical Reason, Watkins explores several issues connected with  Kant's notion of the highest good: why there must be an object of pure  practical reason at all, why there must be one such object, why and in what sense  it must be the highest good, and why this must involve virtue and happiness in connection with each other. Willaschek, in his discussion of Kant's  notion of a postulate in general, argues that this kind of belief, that is, one that  is rational to hold even without any (theoretical) evidence, may be more  common than Kant acknowledges.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Let me take a moment to discuss one essay that I  find particularly interesting. Stephen Engstrom discusses Kant's doctrine of  the <i>Triebfeder</i> of morality, that is, the 'spring' -- as Engstrom translates the term --  of pure practical reason. This doctrine is meant to explain how pure reason  of itself exerts an influence over one's sensible nature in such a way that  it makes one's will more susceptible to being determined by the moral law. Kant  argues that consciousness of the moral law strikes down self-conceit, that is,  one's natural propensity to make the satisfaction of one's own inclinations  the sole determining basis of one's will. This leads to a feeling of humiliation  and, in turn, a feeling of respect through which pure reason finally begins to  gain influence over one's sensible nature. Engstrom provides an excellent  discussion of Kant's explanation for the feeling of respect, including a detailed  analysis of self-conceit and the related notion of self-love. He argues that self-conceit involves seeing oneself as the sole authority for what  ought to be done, one whose demands ought to be regarded by everyone as valid. This self-conception is undermined whenever one recognizes that the moral law  is, in fact, the only basis for determining the will that has universal  validity. It is humiliating, Engstrom argues, to acknowledge that the normative scope  of one's own 'law,' valid only for oneself, is vanishingly small in  comparison with that of pure reason, which extends to all rational beings. This humiliation turns to respect when we recognize that the moral law is not  some outside force, but a demand we make of ourselves (pp. 114-117). </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This is an intriguing proposal, but it seems  that, when we become conscious of the moral law, it is not just its universal  validity that strikes down our self-conceit and humiliates us. After all, one who  is self-conceited could look down on what is valid for everyone, holding  himself to his own standard, one that he takes to be higher, more  distinguishing, and nobler than that which the common person finds worthy of respect. An  alternative reading might locate the ground of humiliation in the moral law's unconditional authority. In various examples throughout the second <i>Critique</i> and  in his discussion of the dynamical sublime in the third <i>Critique</i>, Kant  reminds us that we can do whatever reason demands no matter what our concerns as  a sensible being may be. Indeed, the experience of the sublime is just the recognition that nothing sensible can even serve as a measure for the  authority with which reason commands. Insofar as we recognize that absolutely  nothing can stand up to, much less override, the authority of the moral law,  self-conceit's pretension to make the maximal satisfaction of our inclinations the sole  end of all action is thwarted and, as a result, we feel humiliated. We may, of  course, find that we are not, in fact, virtuous enough to follow the moral law.  In becoming conscious of pure reason's demand, I recognize merely that I <i>can</i> treat all of my inclinations as small in comparison, but this is enough  to block self-conceit's attempt to make these inclinations the sole  determining ground of my will. So, what is truly humiliating, I take it, is not, or  not only, the extent to which the moral law is valid but the fact that  reason alone commands with an authority that is absolute.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">I bring up this example because I take it to be representative of how these essays strive to serve as a critical guide  to the second <i>Critique</i>. Even if one might find ways to supplement  Engstrom's reading, his guide to this section of the text is provocative and  illuminating. The other essays are as well. They are not bland, uncontroversial  summaries of Kant's text, but commentaries in the best sense: they offer thoughtful  close readings that stimulate further dialogue. As such, these essays serve as  a guide in one other sense too: they show how good work in the history of philosophy ought to be done.</p>
