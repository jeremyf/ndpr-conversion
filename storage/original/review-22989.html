	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This book is a useful and  sustained examination of a variety of themes in Wittgenstein's <i style="">On Certainty</i>, the very late compilation of remarks inspired by G.E.  Moore's engagement with scepticism and idealism in "A Defence of Common Sense," "Proof of an External World" and a few other papers. Both Moore's and Wittgenstein's views are examined in detail. Among the  topics considered are the strategies of Moore's arguments, ordinary and  philosophical uses of language, differing interpretations of Moore, externalism,  internalism and contextualism, Wittgenstein's objections to Moore, meaning and use, language games, Cartesian and Humean sceptical arguments, the epistemic  and semantic status of so-called "hinge" propositions, epistemic relativism, and a comparison of Wittgenstein's and Moore's views with  those of subsequent philosophers. There is extensive discussion of much of the  secondary literature on Moore and Wittgenstein. The book is a translation from the Italian and I am sorry to say that the translation is often frustrating,  with numerous grammatical and stylistic infelicities making it harder to read  than it should be. Given the wide range of topics Coliva considers, I shall  confine my attention in this review to three that seem to me especially  important: the nonsensical (according to Wittgenstein) character of both Moore's  adducing of his common sense propositions in an attempt to refute scepticism and  idealism, and of the doubts the sceptic raises; Wittgenstein's attempt to respond  to Cartesian sceptical arguments; and the status of hinge propositions.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Wittgenstein was dubious about Moore's use of  the propositions he deployed against scepticism and idealism, though he  found propositions of their general character to be of great interest, but not  for Moore's reasons. I shall turn to Wittgenstein's view of those  propositions shortly, but what of his qualms about Moore's (and the sceptic's) use of  them? According to Coliva, Wittgenstein regarded those uses as nonsensical.  This in itself is not new. What is interesting is her account of why he so  regarded them. On this account, terms like 'know' and terms expressing doubts are meaningful only when used in tightly circumscribed language games. The  rules of these games are so tightly circumscribed that any violation of them  renders the terms meaningless, and those rules are so determinate that Moore's and  the sceptic's violations of them are clear. Assertions involving 'know' are  subject to rules requiring evidence or reasons, and conversational relevance.  Moore's claim to know that, say, he has a hand violates these rules. Expressions  of doubt are subject to rules requiring practical grounds for doubt, and  the possibilities of mistake the sceptic raises violate these rules. These  qualms are not peculiar to discourse concerned with philosophical scepticism:  on Coliva's account, Wittgenstein held that all philosophical discourse  violates the rules of the language games in which the terms it uses are properly employed and so is nonsensical.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">How persuasive are these considerations? To me  they always recall a remark of Hilary Putnam's: "Philosophy may be a  backwater but it's still part of the stream of life." They seem to presuppose a rather extreme version of the view that meaning is somehow determined by  use, one which requires that terms can only be meaningfully deployed in the  context of tightly circumscribed, semiautonomous language games. Coliva may be  right that Wittgenstein entertained such a view in <i style="">On Certainty</i>  (some of his remarks on religion suggest it too). But in the <i style="">Investigations</i>, the notion of a language game is much more loose and heuristic. It is meant to provide  an alternative conception of language to the stringently representational  one of the <i style="">Tractatus</i> (I myself do not think these two conceptions are incompatible) and is not always characterized  by precise, articulable rules (any more than games in general are). Coliva  does seem to advocate the view of language games she attributes to  Wittgenstein, though she concedes that the response to scepticism based on it has not  found wide acceptance.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This is an appropriate point to remark briefly  on the "therapeutic" tendencies of Wittgenstein's late work, on which Coliva places a great deal of weight (though she does not see the late work as entirely therapeutic). To my mind, the only entirely successful example  of philosophical therapy or diagnosis to be found in Wittgenstein is the  critique of the <i style="">Tractatus</i> suggested by the opening parts of the <i style="">Investigations</i>, in which the baroque intricacies of the completed picture theory of propositions are traced to a small number of initially captivating  assumptions or principles (the pictorial character of language and thought, logical  form, determinacy of sense) which are ultimately seen to be baseless. But Wittgenstein had a rather blinkered view of philosophy, and it seems to  me he too quickly assumed that all attempts at systematic philosophizing could  also be shown to be delusional in the way the <i style="">Tractatus</i> was.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In any case, there is a more interesting reason  why the approach to scepticism Coliva attributes (perhaps correctly) to  Wittgenstein seems problematic. She discusses the work of Thompson Clarke and Barry  Stroud, but mostly in connection with an attempt to link the distinction between ordinary and philosophical discourse to contextualism. But Clarke's most important insight (at least according to the oral tradition -- he has  published very little), one that also informs the work of Stroud and Stanley  Cavell, concerns the continuity between the use of 'know' in discussions of  scepticism and in ordinary, nonphilosophical contexts. In particular, we ordinarily require makers of knowledge claims to be able to rule out  counterpossibilities to what they claim to know, a requirement that follows from the  principle that knowledge is closed under known logical consequence. Yet this  requirement is what lies behind Cartesian sceptical arguments like the dream argument.  So if the demand that Moore's and the sceptic's use of 'know' be governed by  the same rules that govern its ordinary use is an appropriate one, it is arguable  that it can be met -- at least unless we can deny or plausibly restrict the  closure principle, which no one has been able to do in a way that commands  widespread acceptance.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Wittgenstein found Moore's attempts to refute  sceptical arguments unconvincing, though he found the common sense propositions  Moore deploys in the course of it extremely interesting (Moore's attempt at a  direct refutation of what Coliva calls Cartesian scepticism occurs in "Four  Forms of Scepticism"). Nevertheless, Coliva does see Wittgenstein as offering a response to Cartesian scepticism, which she identifies with the argument  from dreaming: if I know that I have a hand, then I know that I am not now  dreaming; I do not know that I am not now dreaming; therefore I do not know that I  have a hand. The response is based on an idea first introduced in the <i style="">Investigations</i> and later elaborated by Norman Malcolm in his book <i style="">Dreaming</i>, to the effect that while dreaming one can neither make assertions nor  entertain thoughts or beliefs.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">I think Wittgenstein's idea is intriguing, but  its effectiveness as a response to Cartesian scepticism seems to me  questionable. For one thing, the crucial premise of the argument from dreaming is that  I do not now know that I am not now dreaming, and it nowhere requires me to  assert or think that I am. Now either I am now dreaming or I am not. If I am  not, then while I may think that I am not, I arguably do not now know that I am  not, since I seem unable to give a satisfactory answer to the question of how  I know this. On the other hand, if I am now dreaming, I do not now know that I  am not either, since not only is it not true that I am not, I do not now even  believe that I am not. In either case I do not now know that I am not now  dreaming.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The other problem is that Wittgenstein's idea,  to the extent that it is correct, may be based on the peculiar experiential  character of dreaming. It is not at all clear that it can be extended to other Cartesian-style sceptical arguments like the demon argument or its  contemporary brain in a vat and Matrix variants (Coliva somewhat misrepresents the  demon argument by suggesting that what the demon is supposed to do is cause us  to have deceptive <i style="">dreams</i>, rather than directly inculcating deceptive thoughts, sensations and ideas in us).  Putnam has tried to argue, based on a casual theory of reference, not that a  brain in a vat could not have any thoughts, but rather that the contents of its  thoughts could not be what are needed to make Cartesian sceptical arguments work.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup>  But most philosophers have not found his arguments convincing.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Let me turn finally to the role and status of  the propositions resembling Moore's that Wittgenstein found so interesting,  which have come to be called hinge propositions. I think it need not be  assumed that they coincide exactly with Moore's (Coliva makes needlessly heavy going  over propositions like 'No one has ever been to the moon' and 'The earth has  existed for a very long time,' which have been falsified on the one hand or  disputed by Biblical literalists on the other). Most agree that Wittgenstein thinks  that while they may have the form of empirical propositions, we have not  actually investigated them and cannot give adequate reasons for accepting them.  Rather, the attitude we adopt towards them in practice (e.g., taking them for  granted, though Coliva resists this way of putting it) allows us to teach and  learn language games and language in general and engage in activities of  epistemic inquiry in particular. For example, if a pupil is constantly raising  doubts about the existence of the objects involved in ostensive teaching, that teaching will not be efficacious. Unless we assume our laboratory  instruments are real, we cannot even begin to rely on them to draw conclusions about empirical matters.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Coliva considers in some detail Crispin Wright's  (and to a lesser extent Michael Williams') suggestion that by virtue of playing  the role they do in our acquisition of language and concepts and in our  epistemic practices, these hinge propositions acquire a kind of nonevidential  warrant and are justified and even known in the absence of specific grounds or  reasons. I think she is quite right to reject this view, for, whatever its merits,  it is certainly not Wittgenstein's, who constantly emphasizes that our  language games and epistemic practices do not rest on any sort of knowledge. Her own  view is that the attitude we adopt towards hinge propositions makes them  function as "norms" or rules governing the activities they underlie, which is her interpretation of Wittgenstein's suggestion that while they may have the  form of empirical propositions, they are not. She considers two versions of  this interpretation: what she calls the Kantian version, on which they are  norms and at the same time propositions which are either true or false; and her  own, on which they are simply norms and are not factual propositions or true or  false at all. (This is probably why she resists saying that we take them for  granted in practice, which sounds like we are making a factual assumption, and  why she worries so much about propositions like 'No one has ever been on the  moon' and 'The earth has existed for a very long time.')</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">What does it mean to say that hinge propositions  serve as "norms"? I do not see that Coliva explains this. The closest she comes, it seems to me, is when she suggests that someone's questioning  or failing to acknowledge that there is, say, a hand right in front of him  shows that his sense organs are not functioning properly or that he is  mentally disturbed. It may indeed indicate this, but I do not see how its doing  so can be reconciled with her idea that 'There is a hand in front of me' is  neither factual nor true or false. After all, for one's sense organs to fail to  be functioning properly is (roughly) for them to fail to adequately  register the facts about one's immediate environment (and something similar could be  said about mental disturbance generally). But if 'There is a hand in front of  me' does not report any facts about my environment, then it is hard to see  how questioning it could show that my sense organs were not sensitive to  them. I suspect that part of the problem is that Coliva is too quick to  attribute to Wittgenstein a sweeping antirealism, something I see no reason to do,  though this is hardly the place to pursue the matter.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style="">On Certainty</i> is a fascinating but frustrating compilation, full of false starts,  hesitations and changes of mind, which Coliva helpfully disentangles and some of  which support her (to my mind) somewhat convoluted and confusing reading of  the book. I tend to think that the truth is closer to the surface. Propositions  like Moore's are ordinary factual propositions which in practice we just take  for granted, even though we have not specifically looked into them (which is  not to say that we could not). They do not have an elevated epistemic status  and are not really known in any strict sense (so that Wittgenstein was not  offering any sort of refutation of scepticism, and his indifference to epistemology persisted to the end). But unless we take some such propositions (they  are not fixed) for granted, we could not (given the sort of creatures we are)  acquire the abilities and engage in the practices, including epistemic  practices, we do. In that sense those abilities and practices rest on our accepting  them. And I think that looking at the book in this way has the advantage of being fruitful. </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Richard Miller, for instance, has developed a  view of theory confirmation that strikes me as inspired by something like this  reading of <i style="">On Certainty</i>, though he does not explicitly say it is.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup>  Miller emphasizes the role of what he calls "topic-specific truisms" (e.g., "middle-sized objects usually have the approximate shapes and colors  which eyesight reveals to normal people seeing them in moderate sunlight, close-up") which have not themselves been the objects of scientific inquiry but are accepted by all parties to scientific disputes. He goes  on to show how the acceptance of such truisms plays a role in the resolution  of actual scientific disputes, such as the nineteenth-century dispute  between realists and instrumentalists about molecular theory. Whether or not  this proposal actually owes anything to <i style="">On Certainty</i>, it at least suggests that the book, like almost all of Wittgenstein's writings, remains a source of insights, many undeveloped,  well worth pursuing.</p>    <div style="">
