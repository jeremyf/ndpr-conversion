	<p class="MsoBodyText">In this book, G. Elijah Dann explores the implications of Richard Rorty&#39;s neo-pragmatism for religion and morality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Given the broad landscape surveyed, readers would have benefited from the guidance of a thesis or a central organizing argument; they are not supplied with one.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dann attempts an exposition of Rorty&#39;s published views on religion; an explanation of the deeper import of Rorty&#39;s views for religion; criticism of Tapio Puolimatka&#39;s argument that only moral realism will enable teaching of democratic values to children; criticism of Stephen Carter, Jeffrey Stout, and Nicholas Wolterstorff for their claims that religious belief deserves a larger role in public discourse; criticism of Alvin Plantinga for deriding Rorty&#39;s approach to truth as incoherent in general and unable to trounce religious belief in particular; criticism of Kai Nielsen for finding religious concepts nonsensical; suggestions for new directions in theology; and a presentation of the connection between Rorty&#39;s thinking and the theology of Gianni Vattimo.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although there is a very loose coherence here, there is no central conceptual bond, particularly since Dann focuses heavily on interlocutors of Rorty.<span>&nbsp; </span>Why are Rorty&#39;s views on ethics considered?<span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;Because religious belief also involves moral matters&quot; (43) and &quot;the subject of ethics and meta-ethics is a natural extension of these [religious] topics&quot; (3).<span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;Involves&quot;?<span>&nbsp; </span>A &quot;natural extension&quot;?<span>&nbsp; </span>How?<span>&nbsp; </span>Dann says nothing further, and the reader is left vainly hoping for an integrating analysis.</p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Despite its scattershot approach, this book considers important issues.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once essentialism goes, what becomes of religion?<span>&nbsp; </span>As Dann rightly notes, &quot;Putting aside interest in metaphysics, epistemological foundations and essentialist views of Truth, at most disqualifies some, though not all forms of religious belief&quot; (53).<span>&nbsp; </span>Post-essentialist religion will focus on Deweyan &quot;problems of society&quot; and successful habits of action.<span>&nbsp; </span>All social projects, whether religiously motivated or not, are to be separated from personal pursuits, a Rortyian bifurcation much criticized elsewhere.<span>&nbsp; </span>The private-public distinction is of great value for Rorty&#39;s and Dann&#39;s purposes, however, since it enables a distinction between personally-valued faith on the one hand, and democratically-reasoned projects on the other.<span>&nbsp; </span>Any public project, regardless of its private significance to individuals, is subject to the requirement that it be discussable on the basis of non-idiosyncratic foundations: public conversations cannot proceed properly if some participants rely on presuppositions which other participants cannot accept, such as the authority of the Bible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence Rorty provides the basis for a rebuff of ecclesiastical institutions that impose their theocratic projects on a democratic public, and does so without necessitating a rejection of personal religious faith (interestingly, Rorty has stopped calling himself an atheist and has now adopted the label &quot;anti-clerical&quot;).<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">In some cases, pragmatism may actually revivify private faith, since the opposed, essentialistic approach to truth can make religious belief seem epistemically irresponsible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now believers vexed by their inability to &quot;mirror&quot; religious experience have a philosophical alternative.<span>&nbsp; </span>Beliefs need no longer be defended with claims to know the innate structure of reality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead, beliefs become more &quot;true&quot; the more they enhance human life.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite Dann&#39;s failure to treat these ideas in a carefully structured fashion, the ideas themselves remain important and worth considering.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Dann does make some legitimate, specific contributions.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is correct that Kai Nielsen&#39;s anti-essentialism conflicts with his demand that religious belief satisfy a correspondence theory of truth; as long as belief is not based on metaphysical realism, Nielsen&#39;s attacks on religion cannot succeed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dann is accurate as well when he explains that Alvin Plantinga criticizes Rortyian truth without understanding it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plantinga sees Rorty as claiming that religious believers create God&#39;s existence, and that unbelievers render God non-existent; this results from Plantinga&#39;s confused insistence that Rorty&#39;s understanding of truth as sentential means that human language use creates reality.<span>&nbsp; </span>This befuddles Rorty&#39;s critically important notion that the world is at it is, but requires language and concepts from speakers to characterize that pre-existing world.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dann is also helpful when he notes that Plantinga&#39;s approach to belief relies on an overly rationalistic assessment of epistemic motivation, and that Rorty provides a useful alternate account: we may be appropriately motivated to change our beliefs thanks to our experiences, rather than solely due to discursive Plantingian &quot;defeaters.&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>Dann is intriguing when he pushes for edifying theology over systematic theology (assimilable to Rorty&#39;s edifying rather than systematic philosophy), although what this edifying theology would incorporate or produce is left maddeningly vague.<span>&nbsp; </span>One compelling exception to that vagueness lies in Dann&#39;s brief report on Gianni Vattimo&#39;s analysis of <em>kenosis</em><span style="font-style: normal">, God&#39;s self-emptying and repudiation of transcendence in order to effect the incarnation.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">In other areas, the reader wishes for greater accuracy and deeper analysis.<span>&nbsp; </span>First, in a book putatively focused on the general category of religious belief, it is odd to find the writer discussing nothing but the prospects for specifically Christian religious belief.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dann&#39;s discussion of systematic versus edifying theology makes clear that it is Christianity he has primarily in mind; and yet this is neither what the title has led us to expect, nor an accurate representation of the larger possibilities for religious belief that Rortyanism enables us to consider.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Second, it is surprising to read that &quot;Plantinga is closer to Rorty than he realizes&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>thanks to their shared contention that &quot;there is no final or ultimate way of seeing if our beliefs fit with reality&quot; (126).<span>&nbsp; </span>Certainly both acknowledge that the human situation features dubiety; but Rorty&#39;s anti-representationalism arrives at uncertainty from a very different direction than Plantinga&#39;s traditionalist representationalism-with-no-potential-for-apodictic-fulfillment.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this case, the path one travels to doubt is of signal importance.<span>&nbsp; </span>Given the distance between systematizing epistemology and an edifying refusal to engage in epistemology, Plantinga and Rorty remain just as far from one another as they originally thought they were.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Third, it is vexing to be given no suggestions concerning how, in the absence of essentialism and representationalism, to conceive of God.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is God a successful habit of action?<span>&nbsp; </span>Exactly what is it in which believers believe?<span>&nbsp; </span>What can religious belief <em>be</em><span style="font-style: normal">, or be </span><em>about</em><span style="font-style: normal">, without setting off the pragmatist&#39;s or postmodernist&#39;s warning system?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Dann himself notes, belief must be &quot;about&quot; something, and believers must have sufficient access to what it is in which they believe for them to be able to answer questions about their faith.<span>&nbsp; </span>We want to be able to explain ourselves to ourselves, and to others.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Dann is right, then, when he maintains that it is unfair of Rorty to allow religious believers only &quot;faith&quot; rather than &quot;belief.&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>Given that a religious person could usually give at least some minimal reasons for her beliefs, &quot;belief&quot; does seem to be the appropriate term.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, faith would be entirely empty, which does not conform to believers&#39; experiences. </p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">But Dann misses another philosophical opportunity, for there are important epistemological questions here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Where justification is primarily social, what is the epistemic role of private religious belief?<span>&nbsp; </span>Our beliefs must cohere with our larger culture; what does that mean for religious belief?<span>&nbsp; </span>What does it, in fact, mean for all privately-held beliefs?<span>&nbsp; </span>Our beliefs make use of language and concepts which are themselves cultural products; on the other hand, many of us hold beliefs that are at least somewhat opposed to those predominant in our culture. Are such beliefs potentially licit if linked to &quot;successful habits of action&quot;?<span>&nbsp; </span>But then whose determination of &quot;successful&quot; carries weight?<span>&nbsp; </span>And if we dismiss religious belief too easily on these grounds, how will other privately held beliefs fare?<span>&nbsp; </span>Perhaps these questions evaporate when we insist that religious belief, like other private Rorty-supported beliefs, must be held ironically.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yet it is unclear how religious belief can be sustained with a fully ironic attitude.<span>&nbsp; </span>After Rorty, it seems more important than ever to address these complications.</p>  <p class="MsoBodyText"><em>After Rorty</em><span style="font-style: normal"> addresses a thought-provoking series of topics.<span>&nbsp; </span>It does not link those topics together with a clearly articulated philosophical vision, nor, by and large, does it investigate those topics in an analytically rich and careful fashion.<span>&nbsp; </span>Readers may find the book helpful for a quick overview of Rorty&#39;s thinking on religious matters, and for occasional flashes of insight about the details.<span>&nbsp; </span>But this is not a definitive treatment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Finally, even casual readers are likely to be put off by the high frequency with which spelling, grammatical and stylistic errors arise.<span>&nbsp; </span>One wishes an editor at Continuum had exercised a heavier hand in the shaping and execution of this work.</span></p>
