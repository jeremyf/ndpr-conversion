	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i>The Philosophy of  Richard Rorty</i> is the thirty-second volume in the <i>Library of Living Philosophers</i>  series, which commenced with a volume on the philosopher with whom Rorty is most often compared, John Dewey. With this volume, the series title serves as a sad reminder of Rorty's death at the age of 75 in 2007, while the collection  was still in preparation. For many who, like the reviewer, were in the early  stages of a university career in philosophy at the time, the publication of  Rorty's <i style="">Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</i> in 1979 was a very significant event indeed.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> I imagine that the attitude towards Rorty expressed by James Edwards in  his contribution to the volume is far from unusual: "I am one of those who admire the work (and the man) almost without reservation; one of those  who would not want to imagine what recent . . . philosophy would have been  if Rorty had not been around to shake things up and to forge some unexpected linkages" (658).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup>  Of course not <i style="">everyone</i>, even from that particular generation, reacted to this work, and the stream of writings following it, with admiration. While many saw in Rorty a Socratic  gadfly, to another wing of the profession he was closer to an ancient s<i style="">ophist</i>.  And even among those who <i style="">do</i> admire, admiration rarely  means whole-hearted <i style="">agreement -- </i>many admirers still find troubling elements within Rorty's philosophy, as  Edwards himself seems to.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">With <i style="">Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</i> and the series of collections of essays that  started with <i style="">Consequence of Pragmatism</i> in 1982,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup> Rorty's thought-provoking ideas began to find a wide readership beyond  the bounds of professional philosophy and started to attract the combination of  applause and condemnation that has continued to this day. In fact, collections of critical essays on Rorty, similar in conception and format to the <i style="">Library of Living Philosophers</i> series, have been appearing on a reasonably regular basis since Alan  Malachowski's <i>Reading Rorty</i> in 1990.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup>  Even omitting non-English language volumes and ones with very specific  themes, such as one on "Rorty and Confucianism", there have been, on my count, seven prior to this volume. Of these, a number, like the Malachowski  volume, have followed the <i style="">LLP </i>practice of having paired replies by Rorty to the interpretative and critical  pieces. Both Malachowski's collection and the impressive 2000 volume edited by Robert Brandom, <i>Rorty and His Critics</i>,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup> while large at around 400 pages each, are dwarfed by the <i style="">LLP</i>  volume. With the standard introductory "Intellectual Autobiography", twenty-nine substantial essays, most with replies by Rorty, and an extensive bibliography of Rorty's writings, it is roughly  the size of the other two combined.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">So much has already been written about the  philosophy of Richard Rorty that one might wonder whether there will be much new left  to say. But while it is true that many of the general themes invoked in the  essays in this book have a familiar ring, the majority of contributors manage to  find new and illuminating ways of articulating their senses of agreement and disagreement to make it a very worthwhile addition to the literature.  And as always, Rorty's replies are masterly in their ability to articulate economically the conceptual structure of the issues under dispute and, typically, to defuse criticisms by questioning distinctions presupposed  by them. That there are still avenues of Rorty's thought to explore and  take issue with might alone be taken as testifying to the breadth as well as the  richly inventive nature of his philosophizing.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Clearly then, Rorty has been an eminently <i style="">discussible </i>as well as <i style="">criticizable </i>philosopher,  and one of the reasons for this seems to lie in the fact that since the eighties he has  been regarded as a philosopher who, emerging from the heartland of the fast-professionalizing world of American analytic philosophy -- the  philosophy department at Princeton -- started to write about and engage with what  he calls the "line of thought that leads from Hegel through Kierkegaard and Nietzsche to Heidegger and Derrida" (13) -- a line of thought clearly outside the bounds of philosophy to many within the analytic tradition.  In the late sixties and early seventies, Rorty might have appeared to the  casual observer as a philosopher working centrally within the type of analytic philosophy represented by the Princeton department -- a mode of  philosophy that was to shape the image of what professionalized Anglophone philosophy  would become during the next decades. For example, he was anthologized as the advocate of a radical "eliminative materialist" position within the  early philosophy of mind and had edited a volume on analytic method, <i>The Linguistic Turn</i><span style="">.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup><i> </i></span>But from the autobiographical essay with which the volume  commences one gets an interesting overview of his early years. Thus he describes  his first years at Princeton, where he started as a junior academic in 1960,  as ones in which he felt the need "to speak to some of the issues with  which [his colleagues] were concerned and to write in somewhat the same vein  as they did" (11). The reception of some of this work "made [him] feel that perhaps [he] had a future in the analytic philosophy business" (11), but in the course of putting together <i>The Linguistic Turn</i>, in  particular, and in "figuring out what Carnap and Wittgenstein agreed about, the  better to highlight their obvious differences", he bolstered his "own preference for Wittgensteinian dissolutions of philosophical problems  over constructive solutions" (12), preferences that had also been acquired by his earlier immersion in the pragmatists. And in the course of the  seventies, as he tells it, he was struck <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">by the fact that  Wittgenstein's debunking approach to philosophical problems could as easily be applied  to what my Princeton colleagues thought of as the 'principal problems of  analytic philosophy' as to the problems of the metaphysicians at whom Ayer had  jeered. <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">"Both sets of problems", he had begun to think, "were equally artificial". This then led him "to construct a historical narrative about the development of modern philosophy designed  to support Wittgenstein's suggestion that philosophical problems were just cul-de-sacs down which philosophers had wandered" (12-3). The result was  <i>Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</i><span style="">.</span><o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">On its appearance, many analytic philosophers  responded to <span style="">this work</span> as a betrayal by one of their own, some seeing it as a cynical courting of the emerging "post-modernism" that seemed to be taking over the humanities. But as Rorty tells it, he had already acquired "a taste for ambitious, swooshy,  <i>Geistesgeschichte</i>" (6) in his undergraduate years at the Richard McKeon-dominated  department at the University of Chicago, and on going to Yale, where he did his PhD,  he had been at home in another analytic-lite department, where versions of  absolute idealism were still defended along with attempts to synthesize Whitehead  and Hegel. A quick survey of the 1960s section of Rorty's bibliography  reveals how his more standardly "analytic" publications were interspersed with articles and reviews devoted to traditional pragmatism as well as  thinkers like Blanshard, Hartshorne and Weiss, his erstwhile teachers. Against this background it is easy to see how the more "professional" analytic concerns that were then developing at Princeton could become fodder for  an historicizing approach to philosophy that had predated any serious  engagement with developments in analysis. But Rorty's <i style="">pre-analytic</i> stance now became importantly modified by his assimilation of "what  Carnap and [the latter] Wittgenstein agreed about", giving his thought its familiar "debunking" stamp.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">It was this early attraction to Hegel and "swooshy" grand tellings of the history of philosophy that allowed Rorty in the seventies to massage into his ongoing narrative, in a  seemingly effortless way, philosophical voices new to the Anglophone scene such as  those of the late Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Jacques Derrida, creating  the sorts of "unexpected linkages" to which Edwards refers. And yet this is not enough to capture just those features of Rorty's philosophizing  that makes him such a fascinating, discussible and objection-attracting  figure. Others were reacting against what they took to be the narrowness of the  type of emerging professionalized philosophy, with its focus on technical  semantic problems, that Rorty complained about at Princeton. Thus "continental philosophy" was splitting away to accommodate types of philosophy that  had always been at best marginal to the analytic movement, while some  analytic philosophers such as Hilary Putnam and Stanley Cavell were going in  purportedly "post-analytic" directions. But neither of these movements shared Rorty's resolutely debunking attitude to the tradition of philosophy  itself. Crudely, it might be said that these movements tended to advocate that  there was <i style="">more to philosophy</i> than what was perceived as the narrow technical issues that were coming to define the discipline, but for Rorty there was little worth saving from the "Plato-Kant tradition" that analytic philosophy had displaced. That is, it must be remembered that Rorty's objections to professionalized philosophy <i style="">Princeton-style</i> were themselves an extension of the objections of the <i style="">early  analytic positivists</i> to the "Plato-Kant tradition" itself.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This meant that while Rorty in <i style="">Philosophy  and the Mirror of Nature</i> could compare his "conversational" historicism with the type of Hegel- and Heidegger-inspired "dialogical" historicism of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Rorty's debunking attitude to philosophy was not that of Heidegger nor philosophers inspired by him. For Heidegger, as Peter Dews makes clear  in his essay, freedom from the sorts of linguistic enchantments expressed in  the metaphysics from which Wittgenstein (and following him, Rorty) sought to liberate thought was <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">not so much the  driving force, as itself an expression of a fateful failure to respect the 'ontological difference' between 'Being' and 'beings'. For Rorty, by contrast,  however innovative and insightful a metaphysician may have been in his own day,  his ideas no longer carry any live charge; metaphysical theories have ceased  to address the problems with which <i>we</i> are concerned, even obliquely  (637). <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In short, Rorty's attitude to traditional  philosophy had more in common with the views of Carnap than his <i style="">bête noir</i>,  Heidegger.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In her contribution Susan James rightly  attributes Rorty's vast influence to the "scope and grandeur" of his philosophy, "so rich in thought-provoking asides and quickly sketched connections" (415). But I suggest that the set of features alluded to above has also contributed to Rorty's peculiar status within  intellectual life and has prompted the particular combinations of agreement and  disagreement that can be seen to play out within the essays in this and other similar  volumes. Thus, many of the authors here start from a reasonably-to-strongly  sympathetic position but quickly come to what has been bothering them in Rorty's  particular approach to this or that topic. What one tends to find here are critics  intent on getting more <i style="">truth</i> out of philosophy than Rorty is willing to allow, even if they are in agreement  with his critique of a model of philosophical knowledge that aims at some  divinely eternal over-view.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The essays here are divided up into four  sections: "Pragmatism Old and New", with essays by Cheryl Misak, James W. Allard, Harvey Cormier, Jacquelyn Ann K. Kegley, Robert Cummings  Neville, Jean-Pierre Cometti, Aldo Giorgio Gargani, and María Pía Lara; "The  World Well Lost: Language Representation, and Truth" with Jaroslav Peregrin, János Boros, Huw Price, Yasuhiko Tomida, Albrecht Wellmer, Michael P.  Lynch, David Detmer and Andrzej Szahaj; "Conversation Stoppers: Politics, Progress, and Hope" with Susan James, Richard A. Posner, Yong Huang, J.  B. Schneewind, William L. McBride and Jeffrey Stout; and "A Kind of  Writing: Edifying Conversations" with Raymond D. Boisvert, Gianni Vattimo, Jolán Orbán, Pascal Engel, Miguel Tamen, Peter Dews and James C. Edwards. The  borders between these groupings are understandably very porous with common  themes crossing the boundaries. It is impossible, of course, in even a long  review to do justice to individual essays and to Rorty's replies, or even survey  all of them. In the remainder of this review I will focus on two or three representatives from each of the sections, although not necessarily in  their particular order, in an attempt to give an impression of the sorts of  issues raised and pursued throughout this volume.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Rorty is often cited as the most influential  figure in the recent revival of interest in American pragmatist philosophy and, as  one might expect, the essays in Section I tend to compare the sort of  pragmatism revitalized by him in the wake of figures such as Sellars, Quine and  Davidson with classical pragmatism and the idealist philosophy from which it  emerged. Of the classical pragmatists it is to the work of James and, especially,  Dewey that Rorty mostly appeals. In the course of his essay from Section III,  and drawing on the work of Robert Brandom, Stout gives a nice thumb-nail  sketch of the particularly Deweyan dimension to Rorty's pragmatism. At the heart  of this position is "the social-practical conception of norms that the classical pragmatists took over from Hegel" (540). Rorty's way of understanding  this is to see the source of such norms as "social agreement among human beings" and it is this that ties his pragmatism into his political advocacy of Deweyan democracy and Millian liberalism. To understand that  <i style="">we </i>are the ultimate sources of the norms according to which we think and act is to see claims by particular  sections of the community to unilaterally determine those norms as dangerous  attempts to dominate the rest, hidden behind a quasi-clerical pretense of access to  some ultimate truth existing independently of humans. And for Rorty, as for  Mill, the good community is one which maximizes the chances of individuals  creating unique lives, which for Rorty implies fashioning the "vocabularies" with which they shape their outlooks and behaviors. To the extent that traditional philosophy seeks a source for norms in something <i style="">other</i>  than human agreement, it is to be regarded as just an extension of religion. In short, to see our ideas or language as trying to represent something essentially independent from  us -- seeing philosophical knowledge as ideally a "mirror of nature" -- is just another instance of thinking of ourselves as responsible to  something <i style="">other</i> than <i style="">other human beings</i>.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">A number of papers attempt to bring out features  and shortcomings of Rorty's brand of pragmatism by usefully comparing him to earlier figures. In "Idealism, Pragmatism and the World Well Lost", Allard insightfully compares Rorty to the nineteenth-century Scottish  idealist Edward Caird, seeing both as responding to the "broken harmony of spiritual life" in their own times. Caird had been concerned to  reconcile science with religion, while for Rorty the analogous task is to somehow reconcile science with literary culture regarded as a provider of new vocabularies within which individuals may articulate their values,  aspirations and hopes. But while Caird had appealed to idealist metaphysics to do  this, Rorty, of course, rejects <i style="">any</i> <span style="">metaphysical</span>  solution. Allard, however, like a number of others in the volume, is skeptical of Rorty's strategy for defending humanistic culture in the face of the sciences' perceived monopolization of truth by simply abandoning the idea that it  is the function of language <i style="">in any context </i>to truly represent the world. And while Dewey had similarly protested  against such a representationalist conception of language, Dewey's earlier version of pragmatism, thinks Allard, did not face potential incoherencies that  Rorty's Wittgenstein/Davidson-based version of pragmatism does. In his response to Allard, Rorty clarifies  how he sees the relation between his pragmatism -- which is more a form of "romanticism" -- and nineteenth-century idealism. "Like idealism, romanticism resists the claim that natural science tells us  how reality really is. But romanticism does not go on to offer an  alternative account" (69). And we just don't need the sorts of answers that Allard  says Rorty's pragmatism cannot provide: "After we cease asking which entities are available to serve as truth makers, we can forget about metaphysics" (70).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Kegley, in "False Dichotomies and Mixed  Metaphors: Genuine Individuals Need Genuine Communities", also has reservations  about the capacity for Rorty to do justice to the aspirations he can be seen  as sharing with earlier idealists once the metaphysical project is  abandoned in its entirely, and to this end she contrasts Rorty with the American  idealist Josiah Royce. Like Rorty, Royce rejected any Cartesian conception of the  human subject linked to the "mirroring" conception of knowledge and stressed the idea of the self as coming to be through a type of self-interpretation. Thus she quotes Royce's claim that "my idea of  myself is an interpretation of my past -- linked also with an interpretation of  my hopes and intentions as to my future" (112). This is an idea that looks similar to Rorty's idea that freedom is a product of constructing  narratives of the self in which one frees oneself from the way others try to pin one  down in <i style="">their</i> accounts. But Royce, she thinks, has a more <i style="">concrete</i> sense of the type of community in which this type of self-creation via redescription can  find a place (115). In comparison to the set of criteria Royce comes up with  for the sort of genuine community in which self-creation is possible, Rorty's invocation of the ironist who merely recognizes the ultimate contingency  of her values looks too thin (123-4). But Rorty replies that one's ability to <i style="">identify</i> those "anticommunities" unworthy of one's loyalty will depend on one's belonging to some other. "But what criterion should somebody raised in  the bosom of the Mafia use when deciding whether to rat out her friends and relatives?" (136)<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In her essay from Section III, "Politics and the Progress of Sentiments", James pursues different but linked concerns in the context of Rorty's political thought. One of Rorty's important contributions to contemporary political theory has been to revive Hume's  suggestion that sees "social and political advance as a progress of sentiments" (415) and to focus on the role of "imagination, redescription, and narrative" in this process. Integral to "the capacity of more and less powerful individuals to imagine the sufferings and humiliations of  others, and to conceive of better ways of life in which these deprivations are overcome" is "redescription -- the capacity to reconfigure and re-evaluate existing practices by challenging the terms in which they  are normally discussed and by inventing new normative vocabularies" (416). But James questions the "excessively sharp opposition between reason and passion" which leads Rorty to minimize the role of reason here. "Rorty's emphasis on narratives", she states, "sometimes blurs the important difference between narratives about mainly imaginary states of affairs and narratives that are already realized in more or less  powerful practices" (423). In his response, Rorty reemphasizes that in the light  of the failure to <i style="">rationally</i> ground hope in progress, <i style="">all </i>that is available for us is a type of ungrounded "romantic, utopian hope" (430) sustained by the types of narratives to which he appeals.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The essays of section II "The World Well Lost: Language, Representation, and Truth" tend to focus on these issues in  ways they have come to be discussed in contemporary analytic philosophy.  Peregrin, in "Language, the World, and the Nature of Philosophy", develops a sympathetic sketch of Rorty's pragmatism while pointing to its dangers.  With the claim that pragmatism is a "good servant" but "bad master", he is concerned lest pragmatism comes to be taken as an "ultimate philosophical doctrine" (226) that does more harm than good. "The point is that pragmatism is powerful only if it is  entertained within the context of philosophy carried out as a cooperative  enterprise". Outside this context "pragmatism merely furnishes the combatants with an extra lethal weapon: that of simply dismissing the opponent's views on  the score of not being helpful or interesting" (241-2). In response Rorty enlarges on the role of theorizing <i style="">within</i> the pragmatist's practice. "Though sometimes it works best to say  'that's a bad question, one that we pragmatists don't ask', with some  interlocutors it is more effective to reply, 'here's an answer to that question, since  you insist on asking it'" (248). It is in such contexts that new  philosophical theories, like those of Davidson and Brandom, are useful, despite the  fact that they <i style="">don't</i> claim to say something about the way the world really is.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In her contribution in Section I, "Richard  Rorty's Place in the Pragmatist Pantheon", Misak appeals to Peirce as an early pragmatist whose "pragmatic elucidation" of truth offers a way around problems found in William James and, by implication, Rorty, given the  Jamesian quality of some of his early statements about truth. Rorty had become  aware of the problems of James's definitions of truth and modified his own  position by introducing a "cautionary" dimension to truth to accompany the "endorsing" view according to which we apply the term true "to all the assertions we feel justified in making, or feel others are  justified in making" (38). By itself, the endorsing view seems to <i style="">reduce </i>truth  to justification, but the "cautionary" use breaks this by reminding us that what we take to be justifications are  likely to change in the future, the distinction between present and future justifications now preventing the collapse of truth <i style="">into</i>  justification. But this, she thinks, leads to a thought that Rorty is "loathe to accept. There is something at which we aim that goes  beyond what seems right to us here and now" (38). Peirce's elucidation of this idea is of truth as a belief that would remain <i style="">forever</i>  justified. In his response, Rorty appeals to the Jamesian requirement that conceptual differences <i style="">make </i>a difference. He cannot see how the Peircean idea amounts to  anything more than the "banal thought that we might be wrong. . . . The Peircean  thought seems to me merely to cloak a commonplace in a metaphor (aiming at a  far-off target) [that] provides no practical guidance" (45).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Misak's concerns intersect with those expressed  in Lynch's contribution to Section II, "Truth and the Pathos of Distance". Lynch also rejects the type of deflationary approach to truth that Misak calls the "endorsement" view and, in ways similar to Allard, wants to defend humanistic culture by ways other than Rorty's  general deflation of the notion of truth. The humanities construct narratives  and offer coherent explanations that we evaluate in terms of the notion of truth,  and so we need a way of capturing their capacity for truth. Rather than deflate  truth, Lynch recommends that we be <i style="">pluralists</i> about truth and acknowledge that the features that make humanistic  narratives truth-apt are different from those that make the natural sciences so.  Rorty in reply writes that while Lynch thinks it appropriate to ask the question "what makes it true?", he doubts that "talk of truth-makers has any useful function except to instill the comforting feeling that we  have, somewhere out there in the distance, an invisible friend called Reality" (364).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In his "One Cheer for Representationalism?", Price is happy to accept the deflationary approach to truth and neatly  traces a path to the evisceration of the notion of representation from within  analytic philosophy itself. One can extend the early positivists' "expressivist" treatments of moral claims <i style="">globally</i> with  the aid of deflationary or "minimalist" treatments of truth to a type of antirepresentationalist stance akin to Rorty's. Price shares Rorty's generally Wittgenstein-Carnap approach to  language, as well as his strong resistance to "metaphysics", but, parallel to Brandom, he finds more coherence among the functions of the truth  predicate than Rorty or Wittgenstein allow, given the fundamental role of <i style="">assertion</i> within our language games. Brandom's position, however, threatens to lapse into a metaphysical  account of representation, and so Price contrasts his own <i style="">one</i> cheer  for representationalism with Rorty's none and Brandom's two. Rorty in his response doesn't see much difference between the  stances of all three, but among other things Price's approach draws into question  Rorty's consistent identification throughout the volume of his own position with  that of Brandom, an issue to which I will return.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Boisvert, in "Richard Rorty: Philosopher of the Common Man, <i style="">Almost</i>", finds Rorty's contributions to philosophy to reside in the historicist,  pluralist and anti-foundationalist ideas he so successfully spread, as well as his  powerful reinterpretation of the notion of democracy. But like Peregrin and  others, Boisvert is concerned about the potential for Rorty's position to  transform into a non-therapeutic<i style=""> </i>dualistic theorizing, noting, as had Kegley and James, the "pairs of 'either-ors'" pervading some of Rorty's texts. Rather than Rorty's "blanket rejection of 'essences'", he recommends an attitude to the idea of essence that recontextualizes "what was best about that term" (559).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Boisvert's criticism allows Rorty to expand on  the significance for him of Hegel, whose historicizing approach he  constantly invokes throughout the volume. What Rorty exactly recommends of Hegel's approach to philosophy is hard to pin down, as it is clearly Hegel  stripped of the metaphysics with which he is usually identified. Hegel himself  portrayed his philosophy as the culmination of the Plato-Kant tradition that Rorty abjures, but for Rorty he is the first name in the series that passes  through Kierkegaard and Nietzsche to Heidegger and Derrida. And many of course  will find Hegel an odd precedent for any approach to philosophy that can be  found as common to Wittgenstein and Carnap. In his response to Price, Rorty  opposes his Hegelian stance to Price's Humean one, but one might have difficulty  with what this distinction could count for in Rorty. Price appeals to a type of "anthropology" as the self-image for philosophy and one might wonder if this term might not often capture Rorty's position as well, as he  commonly portrays the virtues of "history" as residing primarily in the fact that it allows us to grasp the contingency of the ideas we come up with.  Might not anthropology do this too?<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">To the differences Price finds between Rorty and  Brandom, one might add their respective attitudes to Kant. For Brandom, Hegel  correctly grasps the spirit of Kant, but for Rorty Hegel is Kant's antithesis.  Rorty's antipathy to Kant is the focus of Boros's essay "Representationalism and Antirepresentationalism: Kant, Davidson, and Rorty", where he points to the oddness of <i style="">not </i>taking Kant as a type of proto-antirepresentationalist. In his reply, Rorty can only find  value in the <i style="">Critique of Pure Reason</i> in that "by exasperating Hegel, it led him to give up on epistemology and  to take the historicist turn" (266). Hegel is often taken to be a critic of "dichotomous" forms of thinking, but, in his reply to Boisvert, Rorty justifies his either-orism once again by invoking Hegel: <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">I think of Hegel as  having shown us that promoting such divisions -- insisting on sharp either-ors -- is necessary to keep the conversation going. Without the great nay-sayers,  and what Bosvert calls 'dreams of radical fresh starts,' we will not have  what Hegel called the 'struggle and labor of the negative' (573).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Dews, in his "'The Infinite is Losing its  Charm': Richard Rorty's Philosophy of Religion and the Conflict Between  Therapeutic and Pragmatic Critique", places Rorty accurately, I believe, in relation to Hegel by putting him in the company of the nineteenth-century "Left  Hegelians", in particular Feuerbach and Stirner:<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">It is hard to  overlook the parallels between Feuerbach's effort to define a radically new mode of philosophizing, and Rorty's advocacy of a post-philosophical thinking,  which has abandoned the quest for timeless truths and immutable structures, in  favor of cultural-political intervention (640). <o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">But Feuerbach's anthropology was in turn open to Stirner's critique of his appeal to "essences", in this case, anthropological ones. Stirner's construal of "the very notion of  objective truth as an outdated trammel, a redundant constraint on the agency of  the self" (644) sounds very Rortyan, and if Rorty's appeal to the communal basis of knowledge and morals seems to separate him from Stirner's "rampaging egoism", there are core elements of his thinking that makes it difficult for him to "hold the line against the Stirnerian anarchist" (645).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Dews wonders if it had been this concern that  had led Rorty in the last decade of his life to "a conception of human emancipation able to house aspirations formerly nurtured by religion" (646). If Rorty's resistance to religion had come to soften, then one  might wonder at the persistence of his antipathy to the Plato-Kant tradition,  given his essentially left-Hegelian conception of it as <i style="">no more</i>  than a continuation of religion. Stout, in "Rorty on Religion and Politics", sees only the "smallest possible adjustment in his original secularism" (534) in Rorty's later attitudes to  religion, however. Stout questions the compatibility of Rorty's "de-divinizing" form of pragmatism -- which he shares with Dewey, but with neither  Peirce nor James -- with other features of his pragmatism. Thus he sees "Rorty's generalized anticlericalism" as "in tension with his antiessentialism" (536) and his exclusion of religiously articulated claims from the public sphere as in tension with his advocacy of  democracy.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">As with a small number of other essays in the  volume, Dews's is not accompanied by Rorty's response because it had been  finished too late. With this essay in particular, I had been looking forward to  Rorty's reply, wondering if and how he was going to slip through the nets Dews  had fashioned for him. Unfortunately, we no longer have the benefit of his table-turning rejoinders. From the evidence provided from this volume,  however, this is unlikely to stop the man and his ideas from remaining, for many,  foci of admiration and provocation and a continuing source of both  inspiration and frustration.<o:p></o:p></p>    <div style="">
