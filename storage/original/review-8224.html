	<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">This is the second book (appearing in the same year as Allen Wood's <i>Kant</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">) in the Blackwell Great Minds series, which has two advertised goals: to give readers a strong sense of the fundamental views of the great western philosophers, and to capture the relevance of these philosophers to the way we think and live today.<span style="">  </span>Clearly, these are both laudable goals, as is Matthews' own more particular goal of contributing to a wider recognition of Augustine's importance as a philosopher (6).<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">Matthews succeeds in achieving his particular goal by making Augustine a dialogue partner with other important philosophers.<span style="">  </span>The book presents an interesting array of topics treated by Augustine<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> -- sometimes using commonly overlooked texts such as the <i>Literal Meaning of Genesis</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">, the <i>Incomplete Commentary on the Literal Meaning of Genesis</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">, and the <i>Sermons</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> -- which it links to similar discussions from the history of philosophy and contemporary philosophy.<span style="">  </span>With this topical and chronological range, Matthews shows that philosophers and students working in epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, logic, philosophy of language, philosophical anthropology, or philosophy of religion, and focusing on any one of a number of authors from Xenophanes to Hintikka, will be compelled to admit that Augustine's philosophical work is sometimes related to their own, and that consequently, comprehensive knowledge of their subject area will require some familiarity with Augustine.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">Arguably, the book also does a good job of presenting the material in a manner appropriate to "the way we live today," in the sense of 'the way we educate and learn today.'<span style="">  </span>It can evoke the (sometimes exciting) classroom experience<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup> of an introduction to Augustine for smart students whose background in philosophy has been topically oriented, who are largely unfamiliar with the primary texts, and whose attention span is best served by switching topics frequently.<span style="">  </span>(Thus, e.g., there are fifteen chapters of about nine pages each, and most of chapter two is devoted to a recapitulation of Augustine's life as recounted in the <i>Confessions,</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> apparently offered in lieu of the <i>Confessions</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> themselves.)<span style="">  </span>To the extent that this student profile describes a typical kind of college student in the U.S., the book could be a palatable way to give many people a first exposure to Augustine, and thereby perform a valuable service.<span style="">  </span>Professors trained as specialists in ancient or late ancient philosophy, in particular, may find the volume a helpful resource for introducing variety into their teaching material. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">Let us now consider the book's content: its communication of Augustine's fundamental views and of their relevance for contemporary thought.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">Sometimes the volume offers illuminating comparisons to contemporary material which is genuinely complementary to Augustine's work.<span style="">  </span>Perhaps the best example is the discussion of time in chapter nine.<span style="">  </span>Here Matthews explicates John McTaggart's much-discussed<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup> 1908 distinction between "A-series" time (involving tensed terms which depend upon a perceiver's 'location' in a timeline, such as "past," "present," and "future") and "B-series" time (in which events are "prior to," "simultaneous with," or "posterior to" other events, without reference to the perspective of someone inside the timeline).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>He rightly compares this to Augustine's talk, on the one hand, of extended time as 'lived' time (the past and future exist only in our minds: <i>Confessions</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> 11.16.21, 11.18.23, 11.20.26), and his talk, on the other hand, of 'objective' time, that is, his use of a standard ancient definition according to which time is that by which we measure changes (e.g. the <i>Literal Meaning of Genesis </i></span><span lang="EN-CA">5.5.12, <i>Confessions </i></span><span lang="EN-CA">11.22.30).<span style="">  </span>The comparison is a useful way to make Augustine's theses explicit and susceptible to analysis.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">Yet how far does the similarity to McTaggart extend?<span style="">  </span>According to McTaggart's idealism, change within the B-series depends ontologically upon the A-series, and the B-series is not real in itself.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>Does Augustine agree?<span style="">  </span>On page 82 we are given to understand that, because Augustine holds that "the only <i>place</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> where <i>periods</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> of time exist is in the mind," he also holds that "time is the measure of <i>something mental</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">" (emphasis added).<span style="">  </span>Chapter nine continues: Augustine "can understand the B-series time line as a human construction, something each of us can make for ourselves" (83); and "from this perspective [sc. that of the A-series perspective of <i>Confessions</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> 11], the objective timeline is what we might call 'a well-founded fiction,' a fiction constructed in the mind of the individual thinker" (84).<span style="">  </span>"'Real' time, that is, human time, is something we put together mentally" (83).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">Matthews is here in prestigious company.<span style="">  </span>Russell offered a similar interpretation of Augustine (though without the use of McTaggart).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>Yet Russell acknowledged that he lacked a specialist's understanding of Augustine, who was "better known to some others" than to himself.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[7]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>Wetzel subsequently pointed out that it is difficult to square Russell's interpretation with Augustine's actual words, e.g. in 11.20.26.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[8]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>I, too, have trouble agreeing with this kind of interpretation.<span style="">  </span>Augustine says that the medium in which extensions of time subsist is the mind (11.27.36).<span style="">  </span>It does not follow necessarily that he believes that time measures merely mental objects; and in fact, he plainly asserts that by time we measure changes in extra-mental objects (e.g. "time enables us to measure the motions <i>of bodies</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> and to say that, for example, this movement requires twice as long as that," 11.23.30, emphasis added).<span style="">  </span>He also indicates that (B-series) time passes whether or not we attend to its passing.<span style="">  </span>One simply cannot help being "in" it, and thus may find upon awakening from a reverie of philosophical musing that it has elapsed (e.g. 11.25.32: "I still do not know what time is, and . . .<span style="">  </span>as I say this I know that I am in time and have been talking about time for a long time").<span style="">  </span>In general, the text of <i>Confessions</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> 11 gives the impression that awareness of the passage of B-series time constitutes A-series time, and thus that the A-series is non-reciprocally dependent on the B-series (see e.g. 11.17.22, 11.20.26).<span style="">  </span>Nevertheless, Matthews' comparison remains helpful because it suggests interesting lines of inquiry.<span style="">  </span>The position of Augustine is both similar to and different from contemporary tensed and tenseless theories of time; and tracing these out in some detail is a worthwhile project.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">This same chapter deals with Augustine on creation, a topic that has received some attention in philosophy of religion circles.<span style="">  </span>Owing to its contemporary relevance, the evolutionary theory Augustine sketches in the <i>Literal Meaning of Genesis</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> attracted the notice of van Inwagen, for instance<i>.</i></span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA"><span style="">[9]</span></span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-CA"> <span style=""> </span>The account offered in that text also resonates provocatively with the Big Bang theory.<span style="">  </span>(Augustine argues that the "six days" are not periods of time, but that God created everything at once (<i>simul omnia facta sunt</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">) in one "blow" of establishing the universe (<i>in ictu condendi</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">, 4.33.51); what he actually created was matter having 'seed-forms,' i.e. having potency to yield the species that actually emerged later (e.g. <i>seminaliter</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">, 4.33.51; <i>fecit [Creator] quae futura essent</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">, 4.35.56; <i>potentialiter</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">, 5.5.14; 5.5.15-16).)<span style="">  </span>Some of the main features of this account are mentioned again in the <i>City of God</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> (11.7, 11.30), though not with the same clarity or detail. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">This book does not mention that account.<span style="">  </span>Doubtless Matthews had his reasons for omitting it, and it would have been interesting to know what they were.<span style="">  </span>Perhaps one reason was that the problem which interests him on pages 78-9 seems to arise only when the <i>Literal Meaning</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> account is excluded.<span style="">  </span>Using <i>City of God</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> 12.16, Matthews posits angelic thoughts, changing from the first moment of creation, in order to save Augustine's assertion that time began with creation: "given his [i.e. Augustine's] assumption that motion is a precondition for time, he could not think there was a time when that angel existed motionless, that is, thoughtless" (79).<span style="">  </span>However, if we say with Augustine in the <i>Literal Meaning</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> that God (also) created matter at the beginning of time, then there is no need to use the angels to account for change.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, if we do this then it becomes clear that Augustine includes the angels primarily for exegetical reasons, not philosophical ones.<span style="">  </span>He introduces them (intelligences, i.e. 'intellectual light'), in order to explain why Genesis speaks of "light," "morning," and "evening" prior to the creation of the sun<sup><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[10]</span></span></a></sup> (<i>Literal Meaning </i></span><span lang="EN-CA">4.22.39; cf. <i>City of God</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> 11.7, 11.9, and, though mentioned only very briefly, the early part of 12.16 itself).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[11]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>The account of angels as the first creatures therefore seems most pertinent to chapter ten ("Faith and Reason"), which concerns the Augustinian method "faith in search of understanding."<span style="">  </span>However, it is notoriously difficult to disentangle Augustine's philosophical projects from his theological ones (and some might argue that in certain cases, it is not even advisable).<span style="">  </span>More generally, it is to this book's credit that it does not exclude all mention of angels from squeamishness or embarrassment.<span style="">  </span>As Harm Goris has recently pointed out, that kind of reaction is counterproductive given the importance of angelology for understanding other areas of medieval metaphysics;<sup><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[12]</span></span></a></sup> and Augustine's other views about angels (that they exist and have a certain nature) depend no less on Middle Platonism than they do on scripture.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">Augustine as a 'philosopher of interiority' continues to provoke discussion,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[13]</span></span></a></sup> and Matthews is right to think that there is more to be said on the matter.<span style="">  </span>He devotes five chapters to exploring the ways that Augustine's positions in the <i>Confessions</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">, <i>Against the Academicians</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">, <i>On Free Choice</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">, and <i>On the Trinity</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> are like and unlike Descartes'.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[14]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>The <i>Confessions</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> as a whole are "actually a 'self-revelation'," despite being in the form of a prayer addressed to God (5) -- apparently they are along the lines of Descartes' conversation with himself about his thoughts.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[15]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>A "most fascinating passage" of <i>Against the Academicians</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> is one which "introduces what, in modern philosophy, is called 'the Problem of the External World' . . .<span style="">  </span>Augustine is introducing here, for the first time in Western Philosophy, the idea of one's own phenomenal world" (19-20), but "he does not recognize the Problem of the External World, let alone try to solve it" (23).<span style="">  </span>"There is, in fact, a dim foreshadowing of Descartes' project in Book 2 of <i>On Free Choice of the Will</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">. . . . One has to admit, however, that Augustine's reconstruction project . . .<span style="">  </span>is nowhere nearly as systematic, ambitious, or compelling as Descartes' project in his <i>Meditations</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">" (36); Augustine "call[s] attention to an inner realm of knowledge each of us has open to us. . .<span style="">  </span>But in no way does he suppose that this realm of inner knowledge is the foundation for all that we know" (42).<span style="">  </span>Elsewhere we hear that, "the explanation Augustine offers [of how we can know that there are rational souls in addition to our own] is, so far as I know, the first statement of what has come to be called 'the argument from analogy for other minds'," (49) but "Augustine is not interested in discussing solipsism.<span style="">  </span>He supposes, without offering any arguments to support the position, that there exists a world quite independently of him" (55).<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">Fresh texts might shed additional light on the question of Augustine's resemblance to Descartes.<span style="">  </span>In one of the sermons discovered by Dolbeau in 1990, for instance, we find: </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-CA">humans cannot turn over good things in their minds, unless they have perceived them through the senses of the body . . .<span style="">  </span>for you cannot, oh human being, think about a good thing, except such as you have been in the habit of seeing or hearing or encountering with some such sense.<span style="">  </span>Whatever has not entered through a sense of your body, also cannot be thought about by your mind (<i>Quidquid non intravit per sensum corporis tui, non potest et cogitari animo tuo</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[16]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">If Dolbeau is right, then this sermon is authentic.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[17]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>The last sentence of the quote evokes the scholastic tag, "There is nothing in the mind which was not first in the senses" (<i>nihil in intellectu quod prius non fuerit in sensu</i></span><span lang="EN-CA">).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[18]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>Augustine knew the claim from the Stoic account of concept-formation, as transmitted by Cicero.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[19]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>Descartes' epistemology was based on a rejection of this claim.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[20]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>Thus, an interesting line of research would be to track textually, and to think through, Augustine's joint commitment to the claim and to the so-called "illumination doctrine."<span style="">  </span>Matthews is more accurate on the latter than a number of other secondary treatments when he describes it as a version of the Platonic theory of innate ideas (59).<span style="">  </span>Yet at times the book could be clearer about the fact that, after Augustine's early dalliance with and repudiation of scepticism (<i>Against the Academics</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> 3.9.20; cf. <i>Confessions</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> 5.10.19, 6.4.6-6.5.7), his epistemology was a classical realism forged from Stoicism as well as Platonism (see e.g. the accounts of sensory cognition in the <i>Literal</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> <i>Meaning of Genesis</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> 9.14.25 with <i>On the Trinity</i></span><span lang="EN-CA"> 9.16, 10.7, 11.2).<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-CA">In sum, we are all indebted to Matthews for continuing to draw attention to Augustine's philosophical range and relevance.<span style="">  </span>In my view, this volume will be helpful primarily as a teaching resource for scholars already grounded in the history of philosophy.<span style="">  </span>It is possible that an untutored neophyte could form a misleading impression about some one of Augustine's fundamental views, in addition to taking away the good things that are to be found in it; but in the hands of a professor with suitable background knowledge, it will be an effective way to pass on Matthews' well-founded enthusiasm for Augustine.<span style="">  </span></span></p>
