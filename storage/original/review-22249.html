	<span lang="EN-IE">This volume brings together  state-of-the art essays on the debate between primary goods (or resourcist) and  capabilities theories of justice.</span>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">Essays by Thomas Pogge and  Erin Kelly lead the defence of the primary goods approach generally considered, and  essays by Elizabeth Anderson and Richard Arneson argue in support of the  capabilities approach. The volume contains five applied essays, which lend  much-needed context to the debate. Norman Daniels argues that his opportunities  approach to justice regarding health, originally written as an extension of Rawlsian primary goods theory, is largely compatible with capabilities theory.  Lorella Terzi engages the central topic of disability in her essay. Not  surprisingly, regarding the just treatment of disabled persons, she supports a  capabilities metric of justice as a 'more promising, and to a certain extent, more  just scheme' than a metric based on primary goods. (This position is not  surprising, because the capability approach has been designed, to a certain extent,  to deal with issues of justice surrounding differently-abled persons.) </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">The just treatment of  children is addressed by Colin Macleod, who argues that neither the primary goods  nor the capabilities approach adequately accounts for justice towards children,  because both accounts rely on an account of human agency that is insensitive to  the intrinsic goods of childhood. Macleod does not suggest that these are irreparable problems for either account, but rather that these accounts  must re-think the primary role that assumptions regarding adult human agency  play in the respective theories. Harry Brighouse and Elaine Unterhalter offer a  soundly commonsensical approach to educational policy. Like Macleod, they argue  that neither primary goods theory nor capabilities theory can independently determine the content of educational opportunities. Instead, the authors conclude that both theories can be jointly informative while  acknowledging that more theoretical tools should be utilized. Ingrid Robeyns analyzes the  two approaches through their application to gender inequalities. In her  essay, she highlights the benefits and obstacles of each of the approaches applied  to the case of gender. Finally, Robeyns proposes that a capability theory can  better meet the challenges of assessing gender justice, if it is supplemented  with certain principles.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">The volume is appropriately  concluded by Amartya Sen, who brings to the book an insightful, broad perspective on  the debate. Sen's addition serves as a book review in itself, describing and assessing the volume as a whole and philosophically engaging with  several of the pieces individually. In order to avoid redundancy with Sen's skilful review, I self-consciously take on the perspective of a political  philosopher, but not as an expert on the intricacies of this debate. (This is a true description of my orientation to the topic.) A reader entrenched in the  debate already will find Sen's review more helpful, perhaps. Indeed, this book  itself is aimed at that expert audience.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">My first expectation of this  volume is that it tells me the difference between the primary goods approach and  the capabilities approach. The difference is far from clear and seems to  face two problems. First, each approach utilizes the other to a large extent.  Second, different authors seem to characterize the views differently; one  author's primary goods approach looks very little like another's.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">However, Robeyns and  Brighouse capture the distinction well, or as well as possible in their introduction.  Political philosophy asks the question: 'What should we look at, when evaluating  whether one state of affairs is more or less just than another?' That is, 'What  is the metric of justice?'</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">On the primary goods  approach, the metric of justice is the goods that one receives from the particular arrangement of social, political, and economic institutions. This  approach, pioneered by John Rawls, measures the <i style="">means</i> (primary goods) for the individual achievement of a good life, while not looking closely at individuals' heterogeneous desires or abilities. By contrast, on the capabilities approach, the metric of justice is the <i style="">ends</i>. A 'capability' is the ability and opportunity that a person has to convert resources into a means to  promote her needs and/or interests. The capabilities approach focuses on freedom and functioning. A functioning is the 'actual living' that a person is able  to achieve. Yet the capabilities approach goes beyond a look at functioning  and "also reflects the intuition that what matters is not merely achieving  the functioning but being free to achieve it" (p. 2).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">In simple terms, the  distinction between the capabilities approach and the primary goods approach is that  capability theorists focus on the ends (heterogeneous individual capabilities) as a measure of justice, while primary goods theorists focus on the means  (fair distribution of resources) as a measure of justice. Not surprisingly,  this distinction quickly blurs as soon as one delves into the actual workings  of a theory of justice. We can hardly discuss the ends without worrying about  the means, and vice versa. The more one reads of the debate between the two approaches, the more it seems that the two approaches cannot dispense  with one another. For example, Anderson offers a capabilities solution to the  problem of unjust stigmas and stereotypes. A capabilities approach, she says,</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-IE">focuses  on the ways informal social norms and expectations affect the ability of  individuals to convert their resources into functionings that have democratic import  . . . [it] can both recognize these injustices and suggest nonresourcist  remedies. For example, public school curricula and student socialization policies  can be revised to stress the importance of tolerance and cooperation across difference, and undermine false stereotypes about gays and lesbians,  women, the disabled, blacks, Muslims, and other disadvantaged groups. Public  institutions can also design affirmative action programs not merely to compensate  victims for unjust resource deprivations, but to facilitate informal intergroup socialization and cooperation. (p. 90)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">Despite Anderson naming it  otherwise, it appears that this is a resourcist solution to a problem identified by a capabilities approach. In the example, public policies (by school  officials or other institutions) address problems of political inequality. The use of  public policies to create opportunities is a resourcist solution. Anderson  argues that her solution is an indirect solution, and therefore not resourcist.  However, it is hard to know what she has in mind here as the distinction between  direct and indirect, and why a resourcist can't make use of both direct and  indirect uses of resources to create more just institutions. Limiting the resourcist  to only direct solutions seems to arbitrarily and needlessly hobble the primary  goods theory.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">In what seems like a contrast  to Anderson's capabilities approach, the primary goods (or resourcist)  approach is open to sharing theoretical space with capabilities. In his essay  defending the resourcist approach, Pogge states, "an account of human capabilities can also play an important and evidentiary role [in a theory of justice].  The observed fact that many persons are lacking certain vital functionings  may be good reason to revise our resourcist criterion of social justice" (p.  50). He continues, "Resources do not, after all, figure as the ultimate ends  in human lives, but as a means for meeting human needs and, ultimately, for pursuing all the diverse ends that persons may set themselves" (p. 51).  On this reading, capabilities and primary goods approaches do not appear to  be alternative theories; rather, they are complementary parts of a larger  theory of justice. However, there are still important differences between the  two approaches to justice. </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">Pogge locates one important  difference between the two approaches in their conceptions of inequality. While  both approaches must account for the natural diversity between persons,  according to Pogge, each approach has a different take on which natural diversity  counts as inequality requiring distributive address. Under a capabilities view,  any feature (natural or otherwise) that affects a person's capabilities is a relevant feature for theories of justice. The measure of justice on this  view is the person's ability and freedom to achieve certain functionings.  What matters is that obstacles to individual functioning are removed and opportunities to function are in place. On the primary goods view, by  contrast, only a certain set of natural differences are relevant from the  perspective of justice -- those differences that are disadvantaged by social  arrangements. On this view, natural diversity becomes inequality only when manmade  institutions treat persons with certain natural endowments unequally. This inequality  should be addressed and/or compensated by social institutions. If an individual  has a feature (such as a disability) that is disadvantaged by the social  arrangements such that the individual has unequal opportunities to advance their  ends, then the social arrangements should be changed to correct for this  inequality.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">Throughout the readings, it  struck me that the above difference identified by Pogge and two other differences  were important to the debate between capabilities and primary goods, or  resourcist, theories. First, the resourcist approach deals first with the question  of what is a fair share of goods, and then distributes that fair share to  persons. In contrast, the capabilities approach deals first with what is necessary  for human functioning, and then demands that each person be given the means  to achieve that functioning. As Anderson points out, because of this  difference, the resourcist approach will have a harder time identifying and  correcting for inequalities. Because of the resourcist focus on goods, the theory  cannot directly show concern for individual heterogeneity. Rather, according to Anderson's interpretation of the resourcist approach, "everyone is entitled to access to a standardized package of resources, unadjusted  for individual variations in their needs and endowments" (p. 92). She illustrates with an example of disabled parking spaces. Disabled parking  spaces are</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-IE">wider  than usual, to provide room to unfold a wheelchair next to the car door.  Disabled persons have a just complaint against lots that lack such parking  spaces: like buildings that lack wheelchair ramps, they are based on a biased  conception of human needs and endowments, tailored to the fully ambulatory. Yet their  claim cannot be accommodated by devising an 'unbiased' parking space, and then including that type of space in the standardized package of resources to  which all are entitled to access, disregarding individual variations in need  and endowment. (p. 92)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">This is an extreme example,  and I don't see any reason why a resourcist would accept that this is a consequence  of her theory. One can have a conception of a standardized parking lot, without  the conception of standardized parking spaces. The former would include  spaces to meet the needs of most individuals represented in society. Some of the  parking spaces would be larger to accommodate the needs of certain members of  society, and most of the spaces would be smaller to meet the needs of others. The  level at which standardization occurs (parking lot vs. parking space, e.g.)  could allow for a great deal of customization for individual heterogeneity. A standardized place of business could include customization for the  individuals who work or are expected to work in that place as part of its 'standard' package. For instance, as part of a 'standardized place of business'  some resources could be set aside at each place of business to provide for  relevant modifications when those became necessary for particular individuals.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">However, I take Anderson's  point to be that the provision of standardized sets of resources will never be as  sensitive to the heterogeneous needs of individuals as the provision of means to individuals under a capability theory. This seems true, even if  standardized sets can be customized.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">Second, the resourcist  approach is inherently entrenched in questions of the scope of political obligation and  ownership, while the capability approach is not. The capability approach first  examines the kinds of functionings that individuals are free and able to achieve.  The duties that others have regarding these capabilities may be generated by  moral as well as by political considerations. Regarding the capabilities of my daughter, I may have certain obligations. In traditional terms, this is  not a political obligation toward my daughter; rather it is a moral one. The capability theorist may wish to limit duties generated by concern for capabilities to the political realm only -- but there is no inherent  reason that this need be the case. In fact, that the theory reaches beyond the  realm of traditional political obligations may be attractive for some. Robeyns  seems to argue this point with regards to gender justice in the conclusion of her  essay,</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-IE">Gender  justice can never appropriately be dealt with when justice is understood as only  a political conception of justice, but needs to include the full scope of  human life, including injustice in the family and the reproduction of injustice-generating social norms, also those (re-) produced with the  Rawlsian 'voluntary associations' . . . the scope of Rawlsian justice is a  serious limitation for the analysis of gender injustice. (p. 232)</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">The resourcist, by contrast,  must deal directly with questions of the scope of political obligation and  property. They examine first the division of particular goods among particular people. Inseparable from this investigation are the queries: (1) What particular  goods are up for distribution, (2) which agents have an expectation regarding  the distribution of those particular goods, and (3) what is the normative  relationship between a particular good and an agent's legitimate expectation  regarding that particular good. Answering the question of whether goods are distributed  fairly will depend on which particular goods are available for distribution,  which particular agents should be included in the distribution of those goods,  and the normative relationship (individual property rights or collective  resource rights) that agents have with the particular goods. For example, one  society (e.g., Kuwait) has a set of legitimate expectations regarding their  natural resources, and it is not legitimate (or at least it may not be  legitimate) for the same set of expectations regarding the resources within Kuwaiti  territory to be held by others (e.g., Iraq). If we ask whether goods are  distributed justly in Iraq, we assume that we have prior knowledge of which  particular goods are being assessed and that the relevant scope of distribution is  to Iraqis. If the particular goods up for distribution are misidentified,  or the scope inclusive of more persons, then the assessment of fairness could  possibly be quite different. Questions of ownership and the scope of political obligation must be examined prior to the resourcist evaluation of  justice in the distribution of goods.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">I don't mean to say that  these questions of ownership and scope are not important for the capability theorist;  they are. However, it seems possible for a capability theorist to assess the  justice of a situation prior to engaging these questions. The same is not true for a  primary goods, or resourcist, theorist. The resourcist must address these  questions prior to her assessment of the fair distribution of goods. This is not a criticism of the resourcist approach. I only mean to highlight what I  see as a major difference between the approaches, especially in their application  to global justice theory.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-IE">This volume on primary goods  and capabilities theory pushes forward a debate on the foundations of  justice. Needless to say, the foundation of justice is a wide and complicated  topic, and many interesting and important issues will be left out of any one  volume. The editors have done an excellent job collecting essays on a central debate  in liberal political theory. In this review I have discussed mainly the  abstract theoretical work. A benefit of this collection is its dedication to  applied theory, which helps to clarify and deepen theoretical considerations. I recommend the volume for anybody interested in the intricacies of the  debate between capability and primary goods approaches.</span></p>
