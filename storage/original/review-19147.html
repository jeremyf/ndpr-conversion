	 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Imagine a possible distant future in which the  poet-philosopher, Jody <span class="SpellE">Azzouni</span>, is at the  core of the undergraduate curriculum. His views on ontology are routinely taught in order to prepare students  for the great questions of the day. There are, of course, pesky historians who  insist that the neo-scholastic reawakening inaugurated by David Lewis should be represented in the undergraduate curriculum -- they claim persuasively  that for about a century Lewis attracted far more attention than <span class="SpellE">Azzouni</span>. (In his contribution to the volume under review Robert Adams calls the  focus on possible worlds and the logic of modality the "coming of age of American philosophy" (312).) In his day Lewis attracted the very best graduate students in the leading philosophy department; working out the detailed implications of the various components of his system seemed to dominate philosophy for over a century. Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Azzouni</span>, who was by no means unknown in his time, never attracted PhD students.  His work seemed to prohibit the parceling out of projects so necessary in an age  of shortened PhDs, instant publication, and the division of labor within <i style="">progressive</i> research programs. Ironically, in the twenty-first century <span class="SpellE">Azzouni</span>  was better known as a quirky novelist and feminist poet before he was  rediscovered as the thinker who radically transformed philosophy post-<span class="SpellE">Quine</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">So  much for fantasy; <span class="GramE">it was inspired by the volume under review</span>. Its core insight -- to place five now canonical  thinkers of the seventeenth century alongside five significant but now largely  untaught and unread thinkers -- is worthy of serious reflection. The five "outsiders" (<span class="SpellE">Gassendi</span>, Digby, Gale, <span class="SpellE">Cudworth</span>, and Malebranche) receive an article  each. The five "insiders" (Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, and Leibniz) all receive at least two articles. The volume teaches that it is very hard  to say at a given time what philosopher/system will last and what the reasons  are for such enduringness. Another thing taught by the volume as a whole is that philosophers can rewrite their history in various ways so that a thinker  can become an insider or return to canonical status when s/he was once not. "Analytic" philosophers may need their historical "myths" (<span class="SpellE">Cottingham</span> introducing his views on Descartes,  165), but philosophy will not always be analytic and its future may require  different myths or a different attitude toward history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">In  fact, at least four of the articles in the volume do not take historical reputation as definitively settled. The articles on <span class="SpellE">Gassendi</span> (by Margaret Osler), Digby (John Henry),  and Malebranche (Andrew Pyle) all advocate (in different ways) a return to prominence of their chosen subject within the profession. Of the three  Osler and Henry are aimed at fellow scholars while Pyle's brief for bringing  Malebranche "in from the cold" (145) also seems aimed at the profession at large (for the related distinction between "specialists" and "mainstream philosophers" see Sorrell on Hobbes, 193, and his contrasts between "specialists" and "leading philosophers" in his article on Descartes, 161). Pyle thinks that Malebranche offers a  very <i style="">usable</i> "Cartesian Dualism" (128). Surprisingly, one of the "insider" chapters, Catherine Wilson on the reception of Leibniz, is also advocacy; Wilson wishes to remove  Leibniz from the clutches of his follower, Wolff, and the "Kantian image of Leibniz" (304) and replace it with one inspired by a <span class="SpellE">Herderian</span> reading of Leibniz:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">the</span></span><span style="" lang="EN-AU"> continuity between man and animal, the multiplicity of possible perspectives, the  ubiquity of sensitivity and appetite, the intrinsic value of individual  personality and distinct cultures and the hints of materialism and <span class="SpellE">eudaemonism</span> -- co-existing with a strong sense of virtue and moral progress --  comprised for [Herder] the 'truths out of Leibniz' (305).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">To  be sure: this volume is not about the rediscovery of figures largely unknown in their own lifetime (e.g., Van Gogh in the history of painting;  or closer to home, Bolzano or <span class="SpellE">Frege</span> in  philosophy) or the rediscovery of a philosopher often deemed un-philosophical (e.g.,  the status of <span class="SpellE">Xenophon</span> in the twentieth century,  but interestingly not the eighteenth). For all the "outsiders" were institutionally quite eminent (often more so than the "insiders") in their lifetime: <span class="SpellE">Gassendi</span> was professor of  the <span class="SpellE">Collège</span> Royal; <span class="SpellE">Cudworth</span>  Master of Christ Church and <span class="SpellE">Regius</span> Professor of Hebrew  at Cambridge University; Digby was a co-founder of the Royal Society; Malebranche's father was secretary to King Louis XIII and famous; even  Gale had several appointments at Oxford before his ejection on religious grounds. Digby's book on the <i style="">Powder of Sympathy</i> was a huge bestseller in its day. All of the outsiders became outsiders  due to developments in philosophy in later ages (with exception, perhaps, of  Gale, whose work was distinctly set against the philosophy of his own time).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">In  particular, the volume reveals that <span class="SpellE">Gassendi</span> (35), Malebranche (122-3), and <span class="SpellE">Cudworth</span>  (114-15) were demoted for a variety of interlocking reasons during the French  Enlightenment centering on <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">D'Alembert's</span></span> and Diderot's <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Éncyclopédie</i></span>. By contrast, Locke had his finest moment in that period once he became assimilated into a <span class="SpellE">Lockean</span>-Newtonian  synthesis that in France was seen as friendly to developing Enlightenment views (266),  while it was seen as friendly to Christian religion in England (263).</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="" lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[1]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style="" lang="EN-AU"> (Interestingly, Rogers notes that Newton initially had read Locke as a <span class="SpellE">Hobbist</span> (261).) Moreover, Daniel Garber's paper on the reception of Leibniz  reveals that the French Enlightenment reading of Leibniz as mathematical  polymath (and not a systematic metaphysician) persisted well into the nineteenth  century despite the <span class="GramE">ever increasing</span> availability of  new <span class="SpellE">Leibnizian</span> texts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Strikingly,  the influential, eighteenth-century French <span class="GramE">gate-keepers</span>  (<span class="SpellE">Fontenelle</span>, Voltaire, Diderot, <span class="SpellE">D'Alembert</span>, etc) are  almost no longer read or taught in philosophy departments. So, their enduring after-effects are largely invisible to later philosophers. The volume implicitly gives an answer to how that came about. Several contributors  note that a number of the insiders only became so as a consequence of Kant's  and German Idealism's re-working of the tradition and the nature of  philosophy (see <span class="SpellE">Wiep</span> van Bunge on the understanding of  Spinoza as a "Continental Rationalist", 223-4; Rogers on the partial demotion of Locke, 261; Wilson on the construction of Leibniz by Kant, 296-301). But  after Kant only Rousseau (the Enlightenment's in-house critic) fits in an  interesting way into the new narrative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">In  fact, the most important element of the Kantian story is tacitly assumed throughout the volume: Descartes, whose natural philosophy was completely discredited by the second half of eighteenth century, was  rescued as an important philosopher by Kant! With one or two notable exceptions the  whole volume is quite traditional in being centered on the philosophical  aftermath of Descartes -- three of the other authors discussed (<span class="SpellE">Gassendi</span>, Hobbes, and Digby) were also in the <span class="SpellE">Mersenne</span>  Circle, and of the remainder only Gale cannot be understood as responding to  Descartes' program in some way. But this way of reading the seventeenth century  makes most sense if one understands the nature of "philosophy" through post-Kantian eyes! So the volume can somehow leave out Bacon, <span class="GramE">whose</span><i style=""> Great Instauration</i> provides the proud epigraph of the <i style="">Critique  of Pure Reason</i>; Kant's new understanding of philosophy demotes Bacon to the mere promoter of "physical science". Moreover, the Kantian/Idealist narrative does not allow much space to the <i style="">eclectics</i> Grotius and <span class="SpellE">Pufendorf</span>  -- both hugely influential in their day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Thus,  while nobody can deny that <span class="SpellE">Gassendi</span> was important in preparing the way for many standard Empiricist doctrines,  the choice of four other "outsiders" seems arbitrary and without compelling philosophic vision; if Malebranche deserves to be  rehabilitated, why not his great critics, <span class="SpellE">Arnauld</span> or Bayle? As <span class="SpellE">Malenbranche's</span> advocate Pyle notes, it was Bayle  who "largely demolished" the "harmonious synthesis between faith and reason sought by Malebranche" (123). If Malebranche must be read in  order to situate Hume, the argument for Bayle is stronger yet. Why no chapter  on the very subtle <span class="SpellE">Geulincx</span> (beloved by Nietzsche  and Beckett)? G.A.J. Rogers' introduction notes but does not explain the  absence of women in the volume. Last but not least, why no chapter on Newton?  Newton is being re-discovered by a large number of American and French historians  of philosophy, after all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">The  effects of parochial, canonical <span class="GramE">gate-keeping</span> are visible elsewhere in this volume in two ways. First, negatively, the British contributors battle Ryle's views on the history of philosophy  (Pyle on Malebranche, 128; <span class="SpellE">Cottingham</span> on Descartes,  164ff; Rogers on Locke, 258; Ayers on Locke, 274; even the French Faye writing  about Descartes and Heidegger takes a pot-shot at Ryle, 181). The only  non-critical comment about Ryle is when he used as an authority on the mannerisms of <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinians</span> (Sorrell on Descartes, 158).  Russell comes in for similar, but far more muted criticism (Pyle on Malebranche, 125;  Ayers on Locke, 269-70) as well as praise (Adams on Leibniz, 309ff). Yet,  outside a certain generation in the UK (and, perhaps, a dated narrative within  philosophy of mind), Ryle's pronouncements on the history of philosophy do not loom  very large. In fairness to Ayers, his article attempts to answer the question<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">why</span></span><span style="" lang="EN-AU"> so many twentieth century British philosophers seem to have settled for a view  of the <i style="">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i> in particular as the work of a second-rate, coarse, muddled intellect,  lucky in having his ideas developed or criticised by subtler minds (269).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">The  obsession with first and second raters (also evident in Rogers' introduction, 5) seems very . . . un-philosophical. Nevertheless, a  large part of Ayers' very interesting answer involves explaining how Locke fits  into the contested landscape between and within idealists and realists of British philosophy in the first half of the twentieth century (273), which, in  turn, became the subject of "revolutionary" rejection of "metaphysics" by the (no means methodologically unified) founders of analytic philosophy (275). The other part of Ayer's answer is a focus on  style: Locke's style was once highly "successful" but is now far removed from reigning philosophic style (277).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Second,  positively, Robert <span class="SpellE">Merrihew</span> Adams traces Leibniz's high status in twentieth-century analytic philosophy.  While making some shrewd observations on the functioning of the American  academic job market (312) and also noting the increasing number of very important <span class="SpellE">Leibnizian</span> texts that have become available  (309-10), Adams stresses that Leibniz's popularity is grounded in that he "repays study . . . in the frequency with which he offers answers to philosophical  questions we have reasons to address to him" (311). Adams never explores who "we" are, but tacitly admits these questions may shift with fashion from logic at the start of the twentieth century to questions about body  at its end. In treating Locke, Ayers provides the necessary illumination.  Within twentieth-century analytic philosophy historical figures came only to be understood in terms of "separable 'topics', 'problems' or tasks for analysis." A "philosopher's overall motivation, strategy or struggle for system" are uninteresting (275). <span class="GramE">Ayers connects</span> his analysis with the methodological debate within early modern  philosophy between rational reconstruction (mainstream analytic philosophy) and  contextual history (the leading specialists), but this judgment seems to me  parochial (specifically, British). Alan Nelson and Michael Della <span class="SpellE">Rocca</span>, Americans who are by no means <span class="SpellE">contextualists</span>  in Ayers' sense, are with their students among the keenest historians of  early modern philosophy at exploring the systematic nature of the philosophers  they study.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">* * * * * *<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Two  of the five chapters on outsiders provide useful, general introductions to the thought and significance of Malebranche and <span class="SpellE">Gassendi</span>. Unfortunately, the chapter on <span class="SpellE">Cudworth</span> by Benjamin Carter devotes most attention to <span class="SpellE">Cudworth's</span> life and very little to examining his views. The chapters on Digby and  Gale are more ambitious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">John  Henry's chapter on Sir <span class="SpellE">Kenelm</span> Digby also starts by unapologetically claiming that Digby's "posthumous reputation  as a natural philosopher ought to be much greater than it is." For Digby published the first "fully worked-out system of mechanical philosophy" in English in the same year (1644) as Descartes' <i style="">Principia</i>  (43). What makes Digby especially interesting is that his "quasi-atomistic mechanical  philosophy was thoroughly Aristotelian" (44). Moreover, Digby's <span class="SpellE">Aristotelianism</span> is self-conscious because he is aiming to defend "Roman Catholic  theology", especially the immortality of the soul (45; here one would have wished  more comparisons with Descartes). Digby traces his atomism to Aristotle's <i style="">Generation and Corruption</i>, a move popular among some earlier scholastic Aristotelians (70, n. 35). That is to say,  Digby is very hard to incorporate into the dominant narrative of Early Modern philosophy with its many anti-Aristotelian commitments (see also Sorrell  on Hobbes, 195). But Henry has no doubt that the reason why Digby remained historically and <span class="SpellE">historiographically</span>  marginal is because the Catholic Digby used his natural philosophy to promote "particular religious views" in a "dangerous way" (66). After Spinoza this kind of subservience of philosophy to theology may  seem in bad taste, although Henry fails to note that analytic philosophy has  been more welcoming to those whose philosophy seems also designed to promote  particular religious views (Analytical Thomism, <span class="SpellE">Plantinga</span>,  etc).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">The  chapter on <span class="SpellE">Theophilius</span> Gale is the most interesting chapter on the outsiders because Gale's <i style="">Court of  the Gentiles</i> is itself a history of philosophy -- a genre that became very popular in the seventeenth century. Stephen <span class="SpellE">Pigney</span> argues that one of the crucial issues in  Gale's history is to trace the claims of human reason and divine relation, that  is, to mark out the proper "relationship between philosophy and theology" (85). Gale's "covenant theology" assumed there was "an unfolding history of human salvation", that is, meaning in history. Gale's sensibility about history is alive and well among certain Continental  figures, but this goes unnoticed. Gale's turn to history was, in part, motivated  by his "misgivings about contemporary philosophy" (93). <span class="SpellE">Pigney</span> ends his chapter with a tantalizing observation -- noting that leading  members of the Royal Society were inspired by Gale's work to promote a  philosophical history of their Society so it could be "written into the history of philosophy and the philosophical canon" (93). <span class="SpellE">Pigney</span> leaves it to the reader to note that the Royal Society's subsequent  propaganda success was so great that post-Kant philosophers saw its history as only tangentially theirs, leaving it to scientists and their historians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">* * * * * * <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">In  conclusion, a few comments on the chapters on the insiders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">All  three papers on Descartes focus on Descartes' twentieth-century reputation as everybody's <span class="SpellE">favorite</span>  philosophical villain. Tom Sorrell distinguishes between "history of philosophy" as a "historical enterprise" and as a "philosophical enterprise" (154). The contextual "historical enterprise" is "often philosophically boring" (154). The "remoulding" of historical figures that results from <span class="SpellE">ahistorical</span> history of philosophy often leads to "caricature" (154). Disarmingly, Sorrell sides with caricature, "for the sake of relevance" (154). However, Sorrell wants to reject the caricature he detects in Heidegger  and Wittgenstein who take Descartes as a totemic model for all kinds of  enduring philosophic mistakes and problems. Sorrell's proposed solution is to  advocate a "bridging work in which what is still defensible in <span class="SpellE">Cartesianism</span> from a twenty-first-century point of view is presented as a live and  general philosophical position to as wide a philosophical audience as possible." Yet, Sorrell's "defensible common ground" is the same <span class="SpellE">ahistorical</span>, piecemeal method that Ayers  identifies with standard analytic historiography.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">John  <span class="SpellE">Cottingham</span> attacks what he calls the "secularizing view of Descartes" (172). His main argument against it is that it mistakenly "compartmentalises [Descartes'] system" (172). <span class="SpellE">Cottingham</span> fails to engage with any of the  writings by, say, Gary Hatfield or Catherine Wilson, who have done much to promote  the view that the point of Descartes' <span class="GramE">metaphysics</span> is  to get theology out of physics. In fact, judging by his citation practices, <span class="SpellE">Cottingham</span> seems largely uninterested in what  other scholars have said on the matters discussed by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Emmanuel  Faye wishes to rehabilitate a "humane and philosophical approach to Descartes' philosophy and the modern philosophy which  preceded it" (189). He sets out to reveal the political and <span class="SpellE">Nazistic</span> animus behind Heidegger's anti-<span class="SpellE">Cartesianism</span>.  Along the way Heidegger's attempt to locate "the Cartesian metaphysics of liberty in a scholastic and theological context" is discredited through innuendo and <i style="">ad <span class="SpellE">personam</span></i> arguments. Faye claims that Heidegger is following the lead of Gilson's  reading of Descartes (thus unoriginal, (178-9)) and draws on <span class="SpellE">Uexkull's</span> idea of an <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Umwelt</i></span> (thus racist because <span class="SpellE">Uexkull</span> was the editor  of the race theorist H.S. Chamberlain (181)). Faye is so eager to discredit  Heidegger that he fails to stop to consider how banal the Gilson-Heidegger reading  of Descartes has become among scholarly commentators of Descartes; much of  the best and by now quite standard (and non-<span class="SpellE">Heideggerian</span>) recent work on Descartes takes for granted that Suarez and Aquinas are indispensable background knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">The  two pieces on Hobbes focus on his reputation in twentieth-century philosophy. Sorrell offers empirical evidence to show that Hobbes is  generally not taught in courses on early modern metaphysics and epistemology  (197). Of course, the first two parts of Hobbes' <i style="">Leviathan</i> are widely taught in courses on political philosophy (200), but then  often in terms of meta-ethical concerns rather than Hobbes' own normative ethics  (204). Sorrell rightly claims that <i style="">Leviathan</i> gives an unrepresentative introduction to Hobbes' "general philosophy,  his metaphysics and epistemology, and his natural philosophy" (201).  Sorrell's considered judgment seems to be that Hobbes systematic philosophical  views would not merit much interest anyway (193). Of course, Hobbes' absence  from the philosophical cannon means that undergraduates are not introduced to the historical roots of <span class="SpellE">physicalism</span>. In his  introduction to the volume, Rogers claims that "throughout the eighteenth century [Hobbes] was largely ignored" (12) -- a strange claim because in  Scotland, Hume, Adam Smith, and Thomas Reid (not to mention Rousseau in France)  all devote considerable resources to combating and distancing themselves  from Hobbes. Part of the excitement within the whole of early modern  philosophy is caused by the (material) ghostly shadow of Hobbes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Luc <span class="SpellE">Foisneau</span> offers a brilliant rereading of Foucault's complex relationship to Hobbes (as presented in Foucault's  1976 lectures). In doing so he manages to get crucial aspects of both  thinkers in clear vision. <span class="SpellE">Foisneau</span> lays out how Foucault  wishes to do away with a focus on sovereignty because it legitimizes domination  (209) and effaces how "disciplinary power" operates (210). On <span class="SpellE">Foisneau's</span> reading, Foucault mines the history of philosophy of Hobbes' time for a philosophical strategy that evades  Hobbes' conceptual apparatus -- to be precise, historically Hobbes gives a new  meaning to sovereignty in order to escape historicizing "<span class="SpellE">historico</span>-political discourses"  that viewed law as permanent struggle between groups (215). Foucault's insight is that "<span class="SpellE">Hobbesian</span> state  of war is not a battlefield on which people are killed, but a system of representations . . . [of] <span class="GramE">wills.</span> . . . It is  not real war, but an abstract state of human relations" (216). Of course, these  are not Kantian pure wills; "it is fear that motivates the will to  acknowledge a sovereign" (217). <span class="SpellE">Foisneau</span> then turns to a close reading of the crucial chapter 13 of <i style="">Leviathan </i>to vindicate Foucault's reading that Hobbes "does not use the thesis of international war except to prove . . . that it is individuals who  are the real disturbers of the peace" (219). <span class="SpellE">Foisneau</span> also reminds the reader that Foucault's alternative, historicizing  project crucially revives a discourse of race struggle that has its own ugly  subsequent history. Foucault plays with fire, and he knows it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">The  two pieces on Spinoza are a study in contrast. Steven Nadler's piece -- in which he argues that Spinoza was an atheist not a pantheist  -- is out of place in this volume. While Nadler calls attention to John <span class="SpellE">Toland's</span> (1705) equation of pantheism with <span class="SpellE">Spinozism</span> and makes a reference to the <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Pantheismusstreit</i></span>, his piece offers straightforward exegesis. <span class="SpellE">Wiep</span> van  Bunge's chapter is a highly condensed, learned reception of Spinoza that is full  of many fascinating details. It makes many fine observations on how after Spinoza's death his friends constructed a corpus that would allow  Spinoza's work be untainted by personal matters (228). Van Bunge's chapter circles  around the importance of Spinoza to the self-conception of German Idealism  after Kant as well as French Marxism since the 1960s. Van Bunge endorses the  anti-idealist and anti-Platonist readings of Spinoza developed by <span class="SpellE">Gueroult</span> (225-6) and he rejects any attempts to link Spinoza to Jewish thought  (229) either by Jewish scholars (229-30) or by <span class="SpellE">Deleuzians</span> (231). Van Bunge is surely correct that Spinoza's vocabulary is much  indebted to Descartes and Hobbes, but it does not follow that Spinoza's views  are. In particular, Van Bunge fails to note that the conceptual apparatus of <span class="SpellE">Gueroult's</span> treatment of the attributes (and  following him a host of analytic philosophers) distinguishes too exclusively between 'subjective' idealism and 'objective' realism -- failing to consider,  for example, that the attributes are <i style="">co-constituted</i> by finite minds and infinite substance. The details of such a reading  cannot be explored here, but history of philosophy need never be <i style="">mere</i>  history because its tools are always subject for critical reexamination.</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="" lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[2]</span></span></span></a></sup><span style="" lang="EN-AU"><o:p></o:p></span></p>    <div style="">
