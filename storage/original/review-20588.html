	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The new translation from Oxford University Press  is the first critical edition of Hegel's Lectures on the History of Philosophy available in English. It supersedes in many respects the previous  translation. The merit and value of the new translation can be best appreciated by  comparing it with the older, less expensive version. Haldane's and Simson's work  is not bad as a translation, but it is more than 100 years old, and its  irremediable defect is that it is a translation of the second German edition, the  least desirable edition of Hegel's History of Philosophy Lectures. Since the  Haldane translation has been very influential and widely reprinted, a word of explanation is in order.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The second German edition of Hegel's Lectures on  the History of Philosophy in the <i>Werke</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1840-1844) was prepared by Michelet, in part as a response to  criticisms made of his first edition (1833-6). Michelet's first German edition is the  richest in source materials, which include Hegel's own lecture manuscripts, transcriptions and/or fair copies made by his students over a period of  several years. However, in the first edition these disparate materials were not distinguished or identified for the reader. Michelet's concern was to  produce something like a book that appeared to issue from a single source, instead of a compilation of lectures delivered over a period of several years.  Consequently Michelet freely mixed Hegel's own lecture manuscripts, which are of  higher historical critical value, with student transcripts. Further, Michelet  did not bother to compare critically the divergent formulations in his sources,  and did not critically evaluate the sources, especially the student transcripts. Michelet's method was to interweave the several sources he had into a  single text in such a way that the external juxtaposition of sources would not  be apparent to the reader, so that the text </span><i>seemed </i><span style="font-style: normal;">to issue as a whole from the spirit of the  author in a single outpouring, i.e., as a unified book, not a compendium of  several sources and lecture series. The result was that Michelet leveled the  difference between Hegel's notes and those of his students, and leveled the  differences between the student transcriptions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The first German edition (1833-6) received  severe criticism from many contemporaries who had attended Hegel's lectures.  The attempt to make the lecture material book-like was not successful and  did violence to the material. For example, Johann Eduard Erdmann attributed  to Michelet's editorial treatment of material part of the blame for  mistakes commonly attributed to Hegel.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Criticisms like this led to a second German  edition (1840-44). Michelet's response to criticisms of the 1836 edition was a  thorough revision that tried to make the material even more book-like with fewer repetitions and even more amalgamation of materials. He reworked the  materials of the first edition by blending phrases and by eliminating long and  repetitive passages. Precisely these editorial principles of blending texts and expressions into a single editorially constructed narrative are what  today cause the second German edition to be regarded as unsuccessful. For  Michelet's revisions in the second edition were not the result of new and better  source materials, or of a critical differentiation of Hegel's lecture  manuscripts from student transcripts, but merely an editorial reworking of the earlier  edition to make it appear more like a book from a single author. The  Haldane-Simson English translation translates the least valuable second German edition (1840-44).<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the 1940's there were efforts to produce a  German critical edition by Hoffmeister. Hoffmeister separates Hegel's  manuscript material from the student transcripts. But Hoffmeister's work remains incomplete and inconsistently implemented. The new German critical  edition is intended as a replacement for Hoffmeister's edition.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">We are confronted by the paradox that Michelet,  who could draw upon his living memory of Hegel's lectures he attended in 1823-4,  produced not one but two editorially constructed texts that blurred and leveled  the differences of his source materials. On the other hand, our contemporary  German editors, who obviously did not attend Hegel's lectures and whose  understanding of Hegel's thought was shaped and mediated by Michelet's edition, have  through critical comparisons and text-critical methods tried to distinguish what Michelet amalgamated, and by drawing upon fewer but still extant  transcripts have tried to evaluate the sources and to produce less misleading and  more accurate texts of those lectures than did Michelet. But these editors  also concede that there are limits to what modern scholarship can achieve:  The project of producing a critical edition has been frustrated by the loss  of many of the original materials, including the loss of all of Hegel's  manuscripts. Because of the loss of these materials, no new edition can be produced following text and source critical methods that equals or surpasses the material richness of the original 1833-6 edition. Although it does not  make use of or exhibit modern editorial practices, the first Michelet edition  remains the most complete compilation of the source material available.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The new German edition concentrates on the  lectures from Hegel's Berlin period (1819, 1820, 1825-6, 1827-8, 1829-30, and 1831)  for which there are distinct lecture transcripts. The version of the lecture  course the editors have selected as the lead text is the 1825-6 version. It was  chosen for the simple, pragmatic reason that it is by far the best attested by five transcripts. This mutual attestation of the best available transcripts  allows the editors to reconstruct the material comparatively with a high degree  of authenticity. The advantage of focusing on one year's lectures is that  it provides a better glimpse of Hegel's delivery of the history of  philosophy in the course of a single academic term, and reconstitutes this lecture  course in more reliable form than did Michelet.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">There is a drawback, namely the content of the  lectures is somewhat reduced in comparison with the original Michelet edition  (1833-6). But this is not a serious disadvantage or omission, for two reasons.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">1) The German  editors point out that while Hegel's academic practice throughout his teaching career was  to teach the history of philosophy as an introduction to philosophy, beginning  with its most abstract formulations and working towards ever more concrete and  developed ideas, most of the development (if any) in Hegel's conception of the  history of philosophy had already occurred prior to his arrival in Berlin, and the  early materials that might document such development have all been lost. All  of the available materials come from the Berlin period, where there is little  revision or development, but rather different emphases.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">2) The 1825-6  transcript which the German editors reconstruct and present more reliably than did  Michelet, should be understood, <i>not as a replacement for Michelet's first  edition (1833-6) but only as a corrective to Michelet's editorial practices</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of amassing all the materials  indistinguishably and failing to correct the numerous errors and discrepancies in his sources. Consequently, the new German critical edition, translated into English,  does not replace or supersede, but rather </span><i>complements the original  German edition (1833-6) </i><span style="font-style: normal;">that still  remains today the richest in source materials.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">So where does this leave the English reader  interested in Hegel's history of philosophy lectures? First, if the 1825-6 lead text  is a corrective to editorial practices of the first German edition, it should  also serve as a corrective to the even worse editorial practices of the  second German edition presented in the older English translation. It is a more accurate, reliable text based on a single academic year's presentation. However, the English reader should be aware that this is a somewhat  reduced text, and that the German editors recommend that since it is not  intended to replace the original (1833-6) edition, but only serve as a correction,  it should be used in conjunction with the original. Consequently, those who require the maximum content and information (if in an editorially  constructed form) will have to make use of the untranslated 1833-6 original edition,  which remains widely available -- -for example in the Suhrkamp edition of  Hegel's <i>Werke</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Those who have  worked with the Haldane translation and compared it with the first Michelet edition, know that the latter is  both richer in sources and more repetitive than the edition that Haldane  translated. Sometimes this can be advantageous, particularly as long as one does not ascribe all the repetitions to Hegel's pedagogical practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Second, with respect to flow of thought and  readability, the new edition is a simpler, less complicated text (less editorial  amalgamation) that is a more direct and in my opinion a more readable expression of  ideas and arguments that are complex and difficult. Most of the time, this is a  clear advantage. One does not have to deal with passages of text that have  been torn from their original context -- a potential fallacy -- and inserted in a different context and narrative that potentially alters their meaning.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Third, the new translation itself is the product  of an experienced translation team that has worked together for nearly 25  years translating Hegel's <i>Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>Philosophy of Right</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. It is a team that has worked on  translation issues and compiled glossaries for most of Hegel's lectures, and for this  reason their translation is superior in both accuracy and readability to Haldane's  and Simson's. If it remains true that every translation is an interpretation  of its original text, the translation of these materials has gone through more  stages of scholarly debate and review than the earlier translation. Haldane and  Simson do not offer a glossary of terms, or ways of easily checking their text  against the German original, all of which are important aids for the  contemporary English reader.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Finally, this first volume includes the  introductions to the History of Philosophy, which are those portions of the lectures that  were most revised and rewritten by Hegel. For those interested in Hegel's  defense of the History of Philosophy as a discipline of philosophy, this is the  most important volume. For those interested in Hegel's views of the study of philosophy in relation to religion, art, ethics and politics, this is an important volume because it presents Hegel's discussion of Chinese and  Indian Philosophy. Hegel's introductions to his History of Philosophy are  presented here for the first time in their differentiation: 1819, 1820-1, 1823-4,  1825-6, 1827-8 and 1829-30. Presented in their discrete lecture series, the  repetitions are more tolerable, useful and intelligible than if blended together  into a single text. And it becomes easier to track the treatment and  elaboration of certain key concepts such as freedom, the idea as a self-generating  organism, the concepts of abstract and concrete, through parallel formulations in different courses. This is not to claim or suggest that there is a  development in Hegel's thought itself in these different lectures, but rather that  our understanding of Hegel's thought, its key concepts, etc., can develop  and be improved. For what comes through is a better understanding of one of the  most powerful justifications of the study of the history of philosophy as philosophy.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Hegel is well aware of and takes seriously  skeptical objections to philosophy based on the diversity of philosophies. The  diversity and opposition of philosophies -- all claiming to be true -- is taken by skeptics as a refutation not only of philosophy but of the idea of  truth. In an era in which the unattainability of truth is widely acknowledged, and  when on the other hand, "philosophy" has become a narrow, esoteric specialty riven with ferocious professional disputes that question, if not dismiss  any philosophical writing before 1911 as "unphilosophie" and "untrue", and when some might prefer to assign the history of philosophy to departments of history, Hegel's lectures can serve as a  reminder that there are alternatives. For Hegel the history of philosophy is not a self-destructive demolition derby that leaves nothing standing. For  while on the empirical historical level every philosophy has been refuted, on  another level no genuine philosophy has ever been refuted. For Hegel the history  of philosophy is also a defense of philosophical diversity as stages in the development of philosophy as a whole. In spite of Hegel's apparently  immodest claim to be giving an account of the whole that incorporates, justifies  and supersedes all its stages as partial truths, he believes only that this  whole itself is important, not that his own account of this whole is final.  Nor does he believe that the history of philosophy is properly regarded as a  series of warm-up exercises for the "big brains" of the present age that have finally solved all the important problems and entered the promised land.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">As his lectures make evident, Hegel takes the  history of philosophy seriously as philosophy. In that history, spirit is both  present and coming to be for itself in freedom. This means that </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The will that is  free is the will whose purpose is universal, for in what is universal I am equal to  myself. Connected with this point is the fact that other people are like me, are  free, for others are just as universal as I am . . . from which it follows  that I am free only insofar as I posit the freedom of others, and that I am free  only insofar as others acknowledge me to be free. Freedom is actual, existing  freedom only when shared with others" (1823-4, p. 231).</p>  If this larger concern about what the history of philosophy is about is lost, then the only thing that may be missing  from the many philosophies and histories of philosophy is philosophy itself.
