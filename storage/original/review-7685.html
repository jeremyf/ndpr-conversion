	<p class="MsoBodyText">As the title suggests, in this ambitious and engaging book Alexander addresses whether there is a human right of freedom of expression.<span style="">  </span>Human rights, to Alexander, are the pre-existing, universal moral rights presumed by such domestic and international legal instruments as the US Constitution and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.<span style="">  </span>The existence of these underlying human rights is too often taken for granted.<span style="">  </span>Alexander's skeptical analysis of freedom of expression is therefore both important and refreshing.<span style="">  </span>His conclusion, however, that there is no human right to freedom of expression is undermined by a lack of argumentative rigor and a tendency to set up straw-man versions of freedom of expression for critique.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">One of the inherent difficulties in writing a book review, of course, is attempting to critically engage with the book's arguments while still doing descriptive justice to the book itself, all in the space of a few pages.<span style="">  </span>In this review I shall attempt to serve these two masters by giving a brief outline of the structure of Alexander's argument and the main justifications for his conclusions, before proposing a couple of specific, but hopefully representative, criticisms of the book's methodology and content.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Alexander's book is in three parts.<span style="">  </span>Part One consists of "laying the foundation for the inquiry" (p. xi).<span style="">  </span>The purpose of the book is to determine <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">whether there is, in fact, a universal moral right of freedom of expression to which . . . international and domestic legal instruments could be referring when they announce a legal right to freedom of expression, and if so, what its scope and content are. (p. 5) <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">This right will exist if there is a valid moral principle such that any person at any time and place has a valid claim that government not penalize or impede in certain ways his or her exercise of expressive liberty, appropriately defined.<span style="">  </span>Alexander's first steps in attempting to demonstrate that no such principle exists consist in eliminating the less plausible forms that have been suggested for this principle, and focusing on the theory that represents the best prospect for establishing a right of freedom of expression.<span style="">  </span>In this way, he delimits his inquiry to whether there is a <i>deontological,</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>negative</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> right on the part of an </span><i>audience</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that </span><i>government</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> not suppress or penalize an expressive activity for the </span><i>purpose</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of preventing a message from being received.<span style="">  </span>To be recognizable as freedom of expression, moreover, the principle "must entail a requirement that government, at least in its capacity as regulator, maintain a stance of evaluative neutrality vis-à-vis messages." (p. 11)<span style="">  </span>This requirement of evaluative neutrality is, according to Alexander, "the problem at the heart of the enterprise" (p. xii) of attempting to justify freedom of expression.<span style="">  </span>But more on that later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In Part Two, Alexander analyses those laws he perceives as being at the core of freedom of expression, namely government actions taken for the purpose of affecting messages.<span style="">  </span>Government regulations with this purpose constitute 'Track One' of the U.S. Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, and Alexander's engagement with the Court's free speech doctrine makes this the most 'legal' part of his book.<span style="">  </span>The author's emphasis returns to more philosophical ground in Part Three.<span style="">  </span>Alexander firstly addresses the various "general justifying theories", both deontological and consequentialist, that have been advanced in support of freedom of expression.<span style="">  </span>After dismissing each of these individually, he goes on to diagnose a common -- and insurmountable ­-- problem faced by any justification of freedom of expression: the requirement of evaluative neutrality leads to a paradox.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">This is the most important argument in the book, and I did not find it entirely convincing.<span style="">  </span>Before I consider this claim in more detail, however, a number of relatively minor points are worth addressing.<span style="">  </span>Alexander puts some effort in Part One into eliminating the less plausible justifications for freedom of speech.<span style="">  </span>He dismisses, for example, consequentialist justifications of freedom of expression, and locates the right in the audience rather than the speaker.<span style="">  </span>Yet the former conclusion appears to play no role in the structure of his later argument, as he gives consequentialist and deontological justifications equal treatment (as it were) in Part Three.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The latter conclusion (in addition to being interesting in its own right) demonstrates two further difficulties in Alexander's book.<span style="">  </span>Firstly, the argument lacks the necessary rigor.<span style="">  </span>Alexander admits that it is natural to think of freedom of expression as the right of the speaker but claims it is more plausible to think of the right as that of the audience and not the speaker.<span style="">  </span>In support of this claim, Alexander proposes several situations in which freedom of expression appears to be implicated yet there is no speaker in whom the right could plausibly be located: a dead author; a child; a thousand monkeys on typewriters who accidentally bang out <i>Das Kapital</i><span style="font-style: normal;">; a person watching a sunset who might "be inspired to have subversive thoughts." (pp. 8-9)<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Some of these examples have force.<span style="">  </span>While we could explain the deceased author example in terms of a right that outlasts his or her lifetime, this does not seem to capture <i>why</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> we object to the banning of a dead author.<span style="">  </span>We object to </span><i>Huckleberry Finn </i><span style="font-style: normal;">being banned in schools, for instance, not out of respect for the continuing rights of Mark Twain but rather because the prohibition prevents school children from the benefits of reading his book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">But this example does not justify Alexander's conclusion, and the other illustrations are less convincing.<span style="">  </span>The sunset-watching scenario is particularly problematic.<span style="">  </span>Because there is "<i>no speaker of any sort</i><span style="font-style: normal;">" (p. 9, emphasis in original) there seems to be no </span><i>speech</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (or expression) of any sort.<span style="">  </span>There is certainly an audience for something -- an aesthetically inspiring natural occurrence, say -- but, whatever it is, it isn't expression<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup>.<span style="">  </span>In fact, if there is any expression taking place it is the conduct of the sunset watcher, who expresses his or her values or interests and tastes by taking the time to watch the sunset.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Alexander's proposition that the right to freedom of expression resides in the audience and not (directly) in the speaker faces a more telling difficulty, however.<span style="">  </span>For just as Alexander has posed examples in which there is (purportedly) no speaker, there are situations in which freedom of speech is apparently implicated without an audience.<span style="">  </span>Suppose the government bans swastika tattoos on the scalp even when hidden by a thick covering of hair, or bans teenagers from writing a diary even when kept under lock and key.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>In each case there is no audience, except the speaker himself or herself.<span style="">  </span>But neither the speaker-as-own-audience response, nor the <i>possibility</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that someone will see the expression, captures </span><i>why</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> freedom of speech would be implicated in these cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Taken in conjunction with Alexander's examples, these cases demonstrate that freedom of expression (if it exists) is a right of both the speaker and the audience.<span style="">  </span>While little ultimately turns on this point in terms of Alexander's fundamental conclusion that there is no right to freedom of expression, it does demonstrate a significant problem in the author's arguments as well as his occasional methodological slippage.<span style="">  </span>For he rebuts a recent argument that freedom of expression is primarily a right of the speaker by claiming that the commentator "has difficulty explaining away three United States Supreme Court decisions." (Fn 14, p. 9.) The target of inquiry, however, is the nature and scope of the <i>moral right</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to freedom of expression, not the United States legal right.<span style="">  </span>With regard to the moral right, at least, the Supreme Court is not authoritative.<span style="">  </span>While Alexander is working from the (entirely plausible) premise that the First Amendment invokes or incorporates the pre-existing moral rights, the precise contours of the legal right could be narrower (or indeed broader) than the moral right -- or the Supreme Court could simply have been wrong.<span style="">  </span>Alexander routinely invokes First Amendment doctrine to support his views, but in terms of whether there is, in truth, a moral right to freedom of expression, the details of this doctrine are neither here nor there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Alexander's ultimate conclusion that there is no right to freedom of expression rests, however, on a different argument, namely that the right is paradoxical.<span style="">  </span>This argument takes a couple of forms, two of which I will address here.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The first form of the argument is marshaled in response to the proposition that freedom of expression is concomitant to democracy. (p. 137)<span style="">  </span>Alexander refers to Schauer's observation that "freedom of expression is thought to oppose and trump democratic decisionmaking, <i>even when those regulations have been democratically enacted</i><span style="font-style: normal;">." (p. 137)<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup><span style="">  </span>Striking down democratically enacted laws in the name of democracy, Alexander claims, is surely paradoxical.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">This argument implicitly draws on a thin, procedural conception of democracy: laws or decisions are democratic if they are made in conformity with some majoritarian process.<span style="">  </span>Such a conception of democracy is unacceptably anemic.<span style="">  </span>Consider a piece of legislation, democratically enacted, that imposes rule by the absolute fiat of a sovereign (perhaps as an electoral response to a leader of extraordinary charisma).<span style="">  </span>Surely there is no contradiction involved in declaring such a law undemocratic<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup>.<span style="">  </span>Such a law has democratic parentage, but the law is not itself democratic.<span style="">  </span>The same could plausibly be said of a law with democratic pedigree that purports to rescind freedom of expression, or of a valid law, passed with majority support that rescinds the franchise for a racial minority.<span style="">  </span>The apparent contradiction disappears if a thicker notion of democracy is considered, incorporating substantive as well as procedural restraints.<span style="">  </span>There are democratic reasons for valuing freedom of speech and racial equality, and so a purportedly 'democratic law' (one that was passed in accordance with a certain majoritarian process) is not a real democratic law in the deeper sense.<span style="">  </span>This is not a new idea, for surely the most sensible way to understand constitutional limitations on majority will is as anti-majoritarian, but not undemocratic.<o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The second form of the paradox argument is that the requirement of <i>evaluative neutrality</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> in the right to freedom of expression leads to an unavoidable paradox.<span style="">  </span>Alexander posits this as akin to the paradox resulting from liberalism generally.<span style="">  </span>At the core of liberalism is the notion that "liberal government cannot impose its views of the Good on dissenters." (p. 147)<span style="">  </span>But when this idea is "operationalized" (to borrow Alexander's term) "liberal government cannot help but be partisan." (p. 147)<span style="">  </span>A liberal government applies the liberal form of governance to all members of a society, even those who disagree with liberalism.<span style="">  </span>Liberalism is intolerant of intolerance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">While Alexander considers these arguments at some length, I shall concentrate on the further claim that freedom of expression is infected by the same inevitable paradox.<span style="">  </span>The first point worth noting is that it's at least possible that a right to freedom of expression could exist independently of a broader theory of liberalism.<span style="">  </span>Even if the paradox argument is fatal to liberalism, it does not necessarily follow that freedom of speech becomes impossible to maintain.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, if we look at the requirement of evaluative neutrality in freedom of expression separate from the broader concerns of liberal governance, then there is no analogous paradox.<span style="">  </span>While liberalism cannot tolerate intolerance, freedom of expression is perfectly able to handle <i>expression</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that is anti-freedom of expression.<span style="">  </span>The fact that the right to freedom of expression extends to Alexander's claim that freedom of expression does not exist, for instance, does not create a paradox in the way that someone who believes it is permissible to act with intolerance towards people of another race or sex creates a paradox for liberalism.<span style="">  </span>To put it another way, there is not the same problem of "operationalizing" in relation to freedom of expression as with liberalism generally.<span style="">  </span>The right to freedom of expression merely requires that a dissenter be allowed to </span><i>say</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that there is such freedom; it does not require that a dissenter be free to restrict the speech of others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Despite these argumentative shortcomings, Alexander's book is an accessible, clearly written work that covers a broad range of issues and theories relating to freedom of expression.<span style="">  </span>His skeptical stance is both refreshing and ambitious -- it is, after all, difficult to prove the <i>nonexistence </i><span style="font-style: normal;">of anything-- but not entirely convincing.<span style="">  </span>There may be no human right of freedom of expression, but Alexander falls short of demonstrating this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"> <o:p></o:p></p>
