	 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Readers  looking for a fight, or the next round of an on-going fight, will not find it here.  And by "here" I mean to refer both to the book under review and this review itself. In just the past six years there have been at least a dozen  books published on Strauss and <span class="SpellE">Straussians</span>,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[1]</span></a></sup> on the work of the thinker and on the politics of his putative influence  over his students. A student of philosophy who somehow missed the entirety of  the past decade might pick up Smith's collection of essays and see nothing  more than a standard, rigorous academic treatment of a philosopher in the  Cambridge Series. Yet anyone who has paid even scant attention to the recent  literature would see something else as well: a careful and purposive <i style="">choice</i>  to avoid rehashing the debate between, on the one hand, those who wish to <i style="">draw the link</i> between Strauss and <span class="SpellE">neoconservatism</span> and/or  the Iraq War and, on the other, those who wish to <i style="">break that connection</i>, to defend Strauss (and sometimes, but not always,  his students as well) from those charges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Instead, and keeping well with the mission statement of the Cambridge Companion to Philosophy series -- to overcome "intimidation" and "serve as a reference for students and non specialists" -- Smith has assembled a  very sober volume. As Smith says in his lucid and succinct introduction, he  has brought together the ten essays in the volume (plus his intro and his  own brief biographical overview of Strauss's life and work, for a total of 12  chapters) in <span class="GramE">order</span> "to canvass the wide range of  Strauss's interests" (6). Some might question whether the term "wide-ranging" can aptly be applied to the group of contributing authors, most of whom are either self-identified <span class="SpellE">Straussians</span>, students of Strauss, or scholars who have taught or studied at the  University of Chicago. Yet I use this passive construction not to smuggle in my own criticism on this front, but rather to displace it. Many recent works on Strauss and contemporary politics have become caught up in a hopeless  and seemingly endless process of <span class="GramE">name calling</span>,  and I have no interest in playing that game. More importantly, it should not come  as a surprise that when faced with the editorial task of finding experts on  Strauss to contribute to an edited volume, Smith would wind up choosing many individuals who fall into one of these three groups. Finally, Smith has,  in fact, brought together a wide array of approaches to Strauss – including some criticisms. More importantly, the book proves broad in terms of  themes (from the problem of modernity, to religion and reason, to social  science method, to political regimes), time periods (from early writings and letters,  some still not translated into English, through the well-known and  widely-read books, to late essays and spoken remarks), and approaches (some authors  treat Strauss as a scholar and actor in his own right, some take him as a  teacher, and some address him as a philosopher engaging with timeless questions).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span style="">Philosophy Between  Religion and Politics<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">As presented, the volume has no explicit structure other than the 12 chapters, but it  divides well into three sections: the first includes Smith's two framing  chapters; the second includes the next five chapters, all of which center on questions  of Strauss's engagement with ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy,  dealing in particular with the modern/<span class="SpellE">premodern</span> divide  and the question of reason and religion; the final section is comprised of five chapters that engage more with questions of politics and society and  includes two chapters focusing directly on politics, two on social science and  liberal education, and a final chapter on the very practical and historical  issue of "<span class="SpellE">Straussians</span>." Smith's chapters are introductory overviews, of course, but they perform the task admirably  and will, I think, provide an excellent resource in years to come both for  those approaching Strauss's works for the first time and for longer-term  readers of Strauss who want a clear and definitive source. Each of the next two  sections appears front-loaded, with some of the more important, controversial or  new material coming in the earlier chapters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">If these twelve distinct essays can be said to come together under a single unifying  theme or idea (and perhaps they cannot), then it is certainly that of "Strauss as philosopher." In particular, Strauss emerges here most clearly as a philosopher who navigates the pre-modern/modern divide. Numerous authors  take up the challenge of re-describing Strauss's critique of modernism, while  others take on the task of showing Strauss's relation to <span class="SpellE">premodern</span> philosophical principles and approaches. In Strauss's own terms,  philosophy was the best answer to the most important question asked by the ancient  Greek thinkers: what is the best way of life? Philosophy responds so well to  the question precisely because the philosophical way of life is one of  questioning, one of pursuing a truth that can never be <span class="GramE">grasped,</span> never answered. But the philosophical pursuit of what Strauss fondly and consistently referred to as "knowledge of the whole" -- to be distinguished from the merely instrumental knowledge of facts and data  within the epistemological terms of modernity -- proved consistently fraught. Philosophy is threatened on the one side by a politics that would  destroy it (3, 33) and on the other by a set of religious principles that would  replace its search for knowledge with the positive content of revelation (115,  174). Few readers of this volume will be surprised to hear about the first  threat, given the familiarity of the example -- <span class="SpellE">Socrates's</span> death at the hands of the Athenian demos. Most readers will also be  acquainted with readings of Strauss that suggest he dealt with the second threat  either by rejecting religious dogma (as an atheist himself) or by <i style="">allowing</i>  and subtly <i style="">encouraging</i> the religious takeover (as a religious believer himself).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">In one of the stronger pieces in the volume, perhaps especially for those who are not  close readers of Strauss's entire body of work, <span class="SpellE">Leora</span>  <span class="SpellE">Batnitzky</span> demonstrates the inadequacies of  each of these responses. All the biographical evidence indicates (and there is a  wealth of such materials cited in this volume, one of the effects of which is to thoroughly humanize Strauss the man<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[2]</span></a></sup>) that Strauss was a non-believing Jew, an atheist who early in life  embraced a strictly <i style="">political</i> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">zionism</span></span> (43). While Strauss obviously understood the role that religious principles played in  supporting social order, there is simply little reason to take him as a religious believer. Using a phrase of Strauss's from his later writings, <span class="SpellE">Batnitzky</span> shows that Strauss's entire corpus holds  together in the way that it grapples with the "theological-political predicament." This phrase names the competing claims of philosophy and religion. Of course, Strauss, many of his students, and most of the contributors to this volume like to refer to philosophy and religion  under the de-historicized titles of "reason and revelation" and they often point to the "theological-political predicament" under the name "the problem of Jerusalem and Athens" (36). The shift to "reason and revelation" serves to indicate that this conflict is not institutional, not reducible to a particular historical battle, while  the latter naming technique ironically situates this universal problem  within a particular Western context. The West thus becomes the non-place where  universal questions are asked and answered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Those who see reason and history differently would very likely challenge the framing  of this predicament by Strauss and his readers; nonetheless, numerous chapters  in this volume use such a framing to clarify and illuminate a great deal of  Strauss's overall project.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[3]</span></a></sup> To see Strauss's project <span class="GramE">as a response to this  predicament is to understand why, despite his consistent and sometimes virulent  critique of modern philosophy (e.g. 52, 129),</span> Strauss never sought a  wholesale return to the pre-modern. The general argument, that Strauss does not  simply or literally wish to return to ancient Philosophy, is repeated by numerous  authors (7, 41-42, 93, 117, 173), but Catherine <span class="SpellE">Zuckert</span>  makes this case most forcefully in her subtle exploration of the <i style="">way  in which</i> Strauss returns to <span class="SpellE">premodern</span> thought. She quotes Strauss's most important statement on this issue: "only we living today can possibly find a solution to the problems of today" (117).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The choice of how one interprets Strauss's own negotiation of the theological-political predicament tells readers a great deal about his positions on key issues  in political theory. As most contributors to this volume read Strauss, he  saw the conflict between reason and revelation as irresolvable because the  positions from which they argue are incommensurable. Revelation can be neither  supported by nor blended with reason; this was the main problem Strauss identified  in medieval philosophy, especially Thomism (58). Nor, however, can the  former be refuted by the latter; this was potentially a problem for the earlier,  perhaps more dogmatically atheistic Strauss who was tempted by this possibility,  before later recognizing the complete incompatibility of the two. Indeed, it is Strauss's later understanding of the fundamental importance of these two "roots of western civilization" (94), that reveals him fully -- according to most of the contributors here -- as a thoroughly  non-dogmatic philosopher who believes in no universal moral standards, no singular  truth. Smith emphasizes this perhaps unexpected or controversial point (one  that certainly cuts against the grain of many criticisms of Strauss) when he  insists that there is nothing absolutist about Strauss's thought, and that his "return to nature" was a return to "flexible" standards (33). Furthermore, a number of chapters emphasize Strauss's "<span class="SpellE">zetetic</span>" understanding of philosophy as <i style="">quest </i>for truth, but never knowledge or possession of it (146, 183); Michael <span class="SpellE">Zuckert</span>  even uses the "<span class="SpellE">zetetic</span>" category as one to help distinguish between the various <span class="SpellE">Straussian</span> "camps" (274-275).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Some readers may balk at the picture of a Strauss with flexible standards, as a skeptical thinker, as one who returned to a "nature" in <span class="SpellE">premodern</span> thought that was <i style="">not</i> fixed and eternal. But those readers are <span class="GramE">well-advised</span>  to engage closely with the readings in this volume, with the work of Strauss, and  perhaps also with the writings of the classic political philosophers that  Strauss and his followers have championed. After all, the tension between the  skeptical, questioning pursuit of knowledge as that which we can never possess, and  the dogmatic claim to <i style="">have</i> such knowledge is surely the tension between (one reading of) Socratic <i style="">elenchus  </i>and (one reading of) the Platonic <span class="SpellE"><i style="">eidos</i></span>.  But even if we take Strauss to have had no <span class="SpellE"><i style="">telos</i></span><i style="">, </i>no knowledge of the "truth of the whole" that he relentlessly presupposed and pursued, there seems much  less doubt about his certitude when it comes to the enemy he fought:  nihilism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Susan Shell quotes Strauss to define <i style="">nihilism</i> as: "'a desire to destroy the present world and its potentialities' unaccompanied by the clear conception of any positive alternatives"  (176). More important, perhaps, than Strauss's consistent opposition to  nihilism was his repeated encountering of it in both modern philosophy and modern  society. It is hard not to agree with Strauss's opposition to nihilism, given his  very definition of it, but in addition to this understanding of nihilism  Strauss repeatedly described for his readers a chain of logic that always  inevitably <i style="">leads to nihilism</i>: historicism leads to relativism, leads to nihilism. And thus, while nihilism is the  rhetorical enemy, historicism is the practical, on-the-ground opponent. Smith puts  it this way on just the second page of the book: "Strauss showed how modernity exhibited a dangerous tendency toward 'historicism' or what became known  as 'nihilism', that is, the view that all standards of justice and morality  are historically relative" (2). This is an important formulation: first, because it contains the common sign chain  historicism-nihilism-relativism (ultimately, they are really all the same), and second, because Smith  here asserts as proven by Strauss precisely what Strauss so frequently simply asserts, that to historicize is to render everything relative, is to "desire to destroy" the world.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[4]</span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">While many contributors to this volume do indeed take it that historicism (because  it leads to nihilism) is a danger or threat that must be responded to --  and therefore that "historicist" authors like Heidegger pose their own dangers as well -- Stanley Rosen's chapter challenges Strauss on just  this point. Rosen characterizes Strauss's argument against  historicism/relativism as resting on this logic: "if everything changes its nature then there is  no nature" and if there is no nature then there is no genuine knowledge at all (124). Rosen questions Strauss's logic: "the claim that everything  is historical is not equivalent to the claim that everything is  permissible" (124). Rosen points to Nietzsche's thought of "eternal return" as suggesting just this possibility. But I think Nietzsche's conception of "<span class="SpellE">perspectivism</span>" poses the most direct alternative Strauss's view. For Nietzsche it is possible to have a view of the  better (a better reading, for example, or a better action in the sense that it is  more life-affirming) without a view of the best. This is precisely what  Strauss sees as impossible: for Strauss, the quest for knowledge cannot merely be a knowledge of particulars but must in fact be knowledge of "the whole." The key to navigating the difference between Strauss's position and that of Nietzsche, or anyone else who affirms the possibility of  knowledge as a historical product, depends on how one understands the relation of  part to whole.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[5]</span></a></sup> And this brings us to the question of interpretation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span style="">Esotericism<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">It can only be understatement to call the question of interpretation a thorny one in  the case of Strauss. In general, when faced with the task of bringing together  disparate essays all on a single author (i.e., the task of editing a volume like  this one) the question of approach must always either be: a) answered at the  outset of the book; b) engaged with directly within the volume; or, c)  displaced to haunt the text. <i style="">Festschrift</i> and critical volumes prime the question of interpretive approach in their own  particular ways, as does, in this instance, the series description. In the case of a volume on Strauss the stakes are multiplied, and Smith therefore faces  an even greater challenge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Smith can safely start with the obvious: Strauss's most explicit statement on  interpretive method, "Persecution and the Art of Writing," also stands as his most famous piece of writing (27). While it is well known that Strauss  claimed to have "rediscovered" the ancient art of "esoteric" writing,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[6]</span></a></sup> this volume clarifies an important related point: precisely this  rediscovery led Strauss to his own personal revolution in thought. Strauss's most  well known, widely read, and harshly criticized books were all written after Strauss developed his own unique hermeneutics. This volume also places that  development/discovery into its rarely discussed historical context. Most readers know that  Strauss was a Jewish German émigré who came to the United States between the  wars and went on to have a long career as a famous University of Chicago  professor. But they may not be aware that between Freiburg and Chicago Strauss spent a  year in Paris, a year in London, two years in Cambridge, and then he lived more  than a decade of his life in New York City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Smith says that in New York "Strauss became a <span class="SpellE">Straussian</span>" (27).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[7]</span></a></sup> And in New York, Strauss stumbled, in a way, upon esotericism. One of  the little jewels of this collection, especially for those not already well  steeped in the secondary literature on Strauss, is the exegesis by Laurence <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span> (and the summary by Smith and others) of  the letters Strauss wrote to Jacob Klein in 1938 and 1939. These letters,  only recently published in German and still <span class="SpellE">untranslated</span> into English, show clearly that Strauss did not develop his hermeneutics independently of his own readings, but truly did "discover" it in the sense that he came upon a way to make sense of a text that, for Strauss,  was previously mysterious or full of contradictions. In the first letter  that <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span> quotes, Strauss tells Klein  that "Maimonides is getting more and more exciting" (63) and from this point on Strauss's excitement only builds, with each letter more full of thrill than the  previous one. Strauss is thrilled because for him Maimonides <i style="">makes  sense </i>when one sees that "Maimonides in his beliefs was <i style="">absolutely</i>  no Jew" (64, emphasis in original) and therefore he cannot be read as a "Jewish philosopher" writing a guide for believers. He must be read, instead, as a  non-believer, writing a "radical critique of the Torah" that sounds to believers as if it is merely a repetition of the Torah, yet which adds "'little' 'additions'" to signal to a few select readers (philosophers) what the text is really all about (65). Strauss's better-known and (as Smith  notes) much maligned theory of esoteric writing is contained in this kernel of  insight (3). Philosophers like Maimonides who write under conditions of persecution (conditions in which to state plainly the truth in the face of dominant  opinion would be to court disaster) must therefore produce texts that contain  within them two very <span class="GramE">much distinct and at times utterly contradictory meanings</span>. This then sets up the requirements for  how good readers, those that Strauss refers to with an ambiguity that some might  find ominous as "the few," will read.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">They  will distinguish between the true teaching as the esoteric teaching and the socially useful teaching as the exoteric teaching; whereas the  exoteric teaching is meant to be easily accessible to every reader, the esoteric teaching discloses itself only to very careful and well-trained readers  after long and concentrated study. (Strauss, WPP, 221-2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">This quote contains the crux of the Strauss's rediscovery of esotericism -- the path that  then led Strauss to reread Plato and many others <i style="">as esoteric writers</i> -- and it includes some of the elements that most  worry non-<span class="SpellE">Straussians</span> about that hermeneutic  approach. One problem with esoteric writing as a general theory of interpretation is  that it becomes very difficult to know when to take an author at his or her  word. Thus, my telling you that I have not written this review esoterically may in  fact be the secret signal I give to a certain few readers that <i style="">I am  in fact</i> writing esoterically, and to indicate to them that they should make sure to read me as such. Indeed, on <span class="SpellE">Lampert's</span> interpretation of him, this is precisely what Strauss does in his essay  on <span class="SpellE">Halevi</span>. This example gives, at one and  the same time, both a powerful illustration of the multiple-layered and sophisticated nature  of esotericism while it also points to the potential dangers and internal contradictions of the theory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Here are the steps of the various readings, starting with <span class="SpellE">Halevi's</span>  text and then moving to Strauss's reading of <span class="SpellE">Halevi</span>  and <span class="SpellE">Lampert's</span> reading of Strauss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">1) <span class="SpellE">Halevi</span> omits a discussion of the conflict between believer and philosopher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">2A)  Strauss says the omission is intentional, designed to show esoterically that this conflict is exactly what matters most. (78)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">2B) But Strauss then goes on to say that we should not "lay too much emphasis on this line of approach" (79).</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="">3) <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span> then argues that this last line is Strauss's esoteric claim: "to not lay too much emphasis on this approach is to take this approach" (79).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">To sum up, <span class="SpellE">Halevi</span>  omits what is, in fact, most important; Strauss downplays what is, in fact, most significant. But if we know that <span class="SpellE">Halevi</span> is writing esoterically (and can only  interpret him properly because of this knowledge) and if we know Strauss is also  writing esoterically in his interpretation (ditto), then we therefore know how  to read Strauss on <span class="SpellE">Halevi</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Fair enough. But what do we know about <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span>? <span class="GramE">Or about me?</span> That is, Strauss's reading locates "two parts" or two meanings in <span class="SpellE">Halevi's</span> text: the exoteric  omission and the esoteric significance of that omission. <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span> then goes on to locate the two parts -- as I have tried to emphasize in  my "2A" and "2B" labeling above -- in Strauss's reading (the exoteric downplaying of importance and the esoteric significance of that  very gesture). My question "what about <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span>" can be expanded and specified: is there a second part, a "3B" to accompany the "3A" above, to <span class="SpellE">Lampert's</span> reading? If there is in fact a "3B," then I would need to offer an interpretation of <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span> that located that  part, i.e., that specified the esoteric meaning (and therefore, in general, delineated the esoteric nature) of <span class="SpellE">Lampert's</span>  text. Moreover, it would then be incumbent upon you, my reader, to specify the  two parts of my reading -- call them "4A" and "4B." If every esoteric reading also becomes an esoteric writing, then how does one  avoid an infinite regress, wherein every interpretation of an esoteric text must  call for a future (esoteric) interpretation of itself?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">One could try to hold the line, to stop the regress, by showing that this volume itself, precisely because it reveals directly the insights of esoteric writing  -- through the exegesis of Strauss's letters of 1938-1939 to anyone who  reads the text, and not just to <span class="SpellE">Straussians</span> -- brings  the esotericism to a stop. Nonetheless, the message of esoteric writing  requires that I immediately question this preceding claim. How would I know that  the direct articulation of the content and approach of the esoteric  interpretation of texts is not itself the exoteric teaching of Strauss? If it were then  the esoteric meaning would be something other, perhaps very much the  opposite. And how can I, as a reader of a secondary source on Strauss, discern the  difference between Strauss's own exoteric arguments and the esoteric exegesis of  those arguments?<sup><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[8]</span></a></sup> Many of the contributors to this volume discuss Strauss's "rediscovery  of esotericism," and there are powerful arguments here to show how this hermeneutics leads Strauss to some of his most important claims within political theory. But aside from <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span>,  who criticizes Strauss, very few authors here deal with these broader  implications of the theory of esotericism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="GramE"><i style=""><span style="">A  Return to Strauss?</span></i></span><i style=""><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Any decent review should give its reader an answer to the most fundamental question of the  genre: namely, should you read this book? Given that this is a rigorous and well researched academic volume that both provides an introduction to, and an overview of, a major figure in philosophy, while also adding to the extant secondary literature on that thinker, then in this case, the question transforms into another, much  larger and thornier one. Should we read Strauss? <span class="SpellE">Shadia</span> Drury's project seems to be designed to prove to us that we should not.  By trying to draw as direct a line as possible between Strauss's political  theory and the politics of neoconservative regime change, Drury treats  Strauss's thought as somehow "dangerous" in itself, as if the goal of her work consisted not so much in interrogating or challenging Strauss's ideas,  but in locating Strauss in a political position that appears to be both the  opposite of Drury's and mostly untenable.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref" title=""><span style="">[9]</span></a></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">There can be no doubt that the very existence of a volume on Strauss in the Cambridge  Companion to Philosoph<i style="">y </i>series argues very forcefully (even if indirectly) for reading Strauss. And obviously the contributors  to this volume all make out a small piece of the case for reading Strauss. Ultimately, I might be said to write a concurring opinion: I agree wholeheartedly with the majority that Strauss should be read, but I  myself might read him for very different reasons than those provided by the  authors of the chapters in this volume. Perhaps like them, I think we should read  Strauss because he was, indeed, a brilliant and engaged thinker and because he  most certainly demonstrated a dazzling ability to interpret difficult and  subtle texts in the history of political thought. But more importantly, and  unlike the contributors this volume, I think we should continue to read Strauss  precisely because he ultimately defended a set of philosophical (and often  political) principles with which I disagree profoundly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Thus, to me it seems not only problematic but also somewhat naive to say, as some  critics of Strauss have been saying over the past decade, that Strauss defended authoritarian politics. Strauss himself certainly did not do so in any  obvious way, and many authors here argue strongly against this position. Chief  among them are William <span class="SpellE">Galston</span> and Steven Smith,  who both make the case for Strauss as quite genuinely "a friend of liberal democracy" (Strauss's line). Put simply, if the debate is "Strauss for tyranny, pro or con?" I come down on the side of Smith, <span class="SpellE">Galston</span>, and the <span class="SpellE">Straussians</span>.  For this very reason, however, I think we should resist the narrow framing  of the debate that has been provided by those opponents of Strauss, like Drury,  who seem to think his work has no merit whatsoever. For in either calling  Strauss a tyrant of sorts, or in making the case for Strauss's support of liberal democracy, a very great deal is left out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">And, in a manner that sounds almost like an esoteric reading (but doesn't require double meanings) what is missing here proves very significant. For regardless  of whether he was a "friend" of "liberal democracy," there can be little doubt that Strauss never defended or supported<i style="">  democracy as such</i>; indeed, as <span class="SpellE">Galston</span> shows, Strauss praised modern liberal democracy precisely for the ways  in which it was more <i style="">aristocratic</i> than ancient democracy (199). Further, while Strauss never clearly defended  authoritarian politics, he did clearly argue <i style="">against</i> both egalitarianism and any radical sense of equality (203). Moreover,  Strauss felt certain that only a few were fit for the life of philosophy that he championed, and he therefore argued fairly directly that philosophy must  be protected from the many who are simply unfit for it as a way of life.  For this reason, much of Strauss's political philosophy seems designed to make  sure that philosophy can continue to exist, but precisely as a private and <span class="SpellE">sheerly</span> pedagogical affair (85, 150).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Those who disagree with Strauss on issues such as philosophy, democracy, and equality will  need to make an argument against Strauss. They will need to show why being a  friend of liberal democracy is not enough, which requires, in turn, articulating  and defending principles or arguments for democracy (perhaps a radical  variant) and equality (perhaps beyond liberalism's terms). And they will need to make  the case for a philosophy that does not turn in on <span class="GramE">itself</span> but rather continually makes its way back to the city. To address  Strauss's political philosophy is one way among many, but perhaps an important  way, to make this case. For this task, among many others, Strauss must be read,  and this book offers a good place to start reading him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%">    <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn1" title=""><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> In a chapter devoted entirely to the category "<span class="SpellE">Straussians</span>," Michael <span class="SpellE">Zuckert</span> defines a <span class="SpellE">Straussian</span> as follows: "one who  works to a degree that cannot be entirely specified within a framework of  Strauss's question and chief concepts, and, if the scholar in question is  concerned with textual studies, deploys Strauss's methods of close reading" (164). For the purposes of this review, I am concerned mainly with Strauss's life  and writings as discussed by the contributors to this volume; therefore I  use the label only occasionally, and mostly when it has already been brought up  by one of those contributors.</span><o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn2" title=""><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> The most ardent anti-<span class="SpellE">Straussian</span>  will find it hard not to pause at Smith's account of a 38-year-old Strauss,  scratching by on a very <span class="SpellE">meager</span> income in New York City,  who writes a letter to his friend expressing both his thrill at teaching his first  seminar ("It really happened!" exclaims Strauss) and then goes on to share the ubiquitous insecurities of the teacher ("But I am a charlatan. I asserted a thousand things that didn't add up or that I didn't know  anything about" [25]).</span><o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn3" title=""><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> That group of thinkers who understand the relation  between reason and history differently from Strauss proves vast. Over the years,  Strauss attached the label "historicist" to the vast majority of modern philosophers, to almost all of twentieth century social science, and to a variety of positions in contemporary political theory. Here I seek  neither to legitimate Strauss's categorization nor to defend those thinkers. My  point is simply that taking Strauss's work as a response to the theological-philosophical problem serves to clarify some of the stakes  of the debate between Strauss and those he would call historicist.</span><o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn4" title=""><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> In some texts of Strauss this desire and logic manifests  itself in the example of cannibalism; i.e., to historicize is to render everything relative is to see nothing wrong with cannibalism. See Strauss,  "Progress or Return" in <i style="">Ten Essays by Leo Strauss</i> (Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989), p. 269; Cf. Thomas <span class="SpellE">Pangle</span>, <i style="">The Rebirth of Classical Political Rationalism</i> (Chicago: U. of Chicago Press,  1989), <span class="GramE">p</span>. 9.</span><o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn5" title=""><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> For Strauss, the very idea of knowledge as a historical  product is <span class="GramE">an</span> historicist notion that  undermines or rejects a genuine pursuit of knowledge as quest for the whole. However, many within the  large group of thinkers who understand knowledge as produced <i style="">in  history </i>also contend that one can abandon the pursuit of "knowledge of the whole" <i style="">without</i> thereby giving up entirely on knowledge, reason, or truth (the  abandonment of which would surely lead to nihilism).</span><o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn6" title=""><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> Strauss makes clear that he does not invent this mode of  writing; as <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span> puts it, Strauss sought to "<i style="">restore </i>esotericism" (76). The overall theory rests on the essential idea that a work contains two  meanings, exoteric and esoteric, but there is some confusion over how to refer to a  work that contains both meanings. <span class="SpellE">Lampert</span>  suggests that Strauss technically called such works "exoteric," but in any case the convention has been established to refer to such writings as "esoteric works" and to refer to the general theory as that of "esoteric writing." I too follow that convention here.</span><o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn7" title=""><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[7]</span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> See footnote 1, above.</span><o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  <div style="" id="edn">  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn8" title=""><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[8]</span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> In addition to this central problem, we also encounter  what I would call the second order effects of esoteric writing/interpreting: namely,  the radical divide between one group of readers and another -- a divide that  can, in turn, lead to a certain insider/outsider status and even to secret  societies trading the secrets of secret readings.</span><o:p></o:p></p>  </div>    <sup><a style="" href="#_ednref" name="_edn9" title=""><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="">[9]</span></span></a></sup><span lang="EN-AU"> There have been at least half a dozen books that respond  to Drury (all cited in the volume under review), so I will confine myself here to  two brief remarks. The first is to say the 2007 exchange, in the pages of <i style="">Political Theory</i>, between Drury and Smith shows clearly enough that the two are talking past one another. In  many ways, the previous exchange, twenty years prior, between Drury, Jaffa,  and <span class="SpellE">Dallmayr</span>, proved more productive in  terms of debating the actual terms and content both of Strauss's work and of political theory  more generally. The more recent debate has one side trying to score political  points and the other defending Strauss. On a related but very much distinct  note, I would suggest that Michael's <span class="SpellE">Zuckert's</span>  decision, in the final chapter of this collection, to place Nicholas <span class="SpellE">Xenos's</span> book together with Drury's project might be unfair. <span class="SpellE">Zuckert</span> announces this decision when he states that he will simply ignore any  work that has linked Strauss's thought to the actions of neoconservatives, and  then follows this assertion with a footnote to Drury and <span class="SpellE">Xenos</span>. <span class="SpellE">Xenos's</span> <span class="GramE">book is a  patient, careful, and incredibly close</span> -- <span class="SpellE">Straussian</span> in  its closeness -- reading of Strauss's actual writings. This is not to say  that <span class="SpellE">Xenos's</span> reading is the right one (and  surely <span class="SpellE">Zuckert</span> would contest it) but to  refuse to engage with <span class="SpellE">Xenos</span> is to suggest  that he himself has not engaged with Strauss. This suggestion is just not true. Even if they both oppose  Strauss in a certain way, and even if they would be challenged or criticized by <span class="GramE">Strauss's <span style=""> </span>supporters</span>, the projects of Drury and <span class="SpellE">Xenos</span> share little  else.</span>
