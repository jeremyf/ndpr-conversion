	<p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">The issue of how we should understand conditionals is obviously of great importance, not least because of the central role that conditionals seem to play in our understanding of natural necessity, causation, chance, dispositions, scientific laws, and rationality.<span style="">  </span>Though it has hardly been neglected by analytic philosophers, there has been a recent series of important books devoted to this topic.<span style="">  </span>But Gauker's new book on this topic offers a particularly original and sophisticated account which builds upon his earlier work in <i>Words Without Meaning</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> (MIT Press, 2003).<span style="">  </span>Gauker is particularly concerned to emphasise the context sensitivity of conditionals.<span style="">  </span>Thus, for example, normally it might be perfectly acceptable to assert the conditional <i>if you turn the corner then you will see a blue house</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> because in all of the prospects relevant to our conversation in which you turn the corner you will see a blue house.<span style="">  </span>But in circumstances that include the prospect of a large fire raging in the immediate neighbourhood it might be illegitimate to assert that conditional since the prospects relevant to our conversation will be different and in some of these prospects you might turn the corner to find the house burnt down.<span style="">  </span>Gauker sets out to capture this sort of context sensitivity in a book that is elegant, sophisticated, and comprehensive. <span style=""> </span>Though some of the chapters are of quite a technical nature, the book is very clearly written and should be required reading for anyone with a serious interest in conditionals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">I begin with an overview of the book.<span style="">  </span>Gauker's book divides approximately into four sections.<span style="">  </span>The first section, chapters 1-3, proceeds as follows: In chapter 1 Gauker sketches his semantic theory.<span style="">  </span>Roughly speaking, Gauker suggests that we consider each conversation as having a goal.<span style="">  </span>This goal, together with the way the world is, will determine an objective context for that conversation.<span style="">  </span>And this context determines what the interlocutors ought to do to best achieve the goal of their conversation.<span style="">  </span>A primitive context is simply a set of literals -- atomic sentences and the negations of atomic sentences.<span style="">  </span>More complex multi-contexts are sets of primitive contexts and/or multi-contexts.<span style="">  </span>And multi-contexts can be expanded in various ways to generate a structure of such expansions.<span style="">  </span>Gauker goes on to offer a recursive characterization of when a given sort of sentence counts as assertible or as deniable in a context.<span style="">  </span>And, in particular, (G) characterizes the assertibility conditions of indicative conditionals:<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin-left: 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(G) <i>A</i></span>→<span style=";font-family:Symbol;color:black;"   lang="EN-CA"><i><span style=""></span></i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>B</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is assertible in a context <i>c</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> iff for every context <i>k</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> in or identical to <i>c</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, if <i>A</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is assertible in <i>k</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> them <i>B</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is assertible in <i>k</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Intuitively, the contexts within <i>c</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> represent a range of prospects. And a conditional may be assertible in one context but not in another in virtue of the second context representing prospects which the first does not. <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">In chapter 2, Gauker uses this semantic theory to provide a novel account of logical consequence while criticising various alternative conceptions including, in particular, the standard model-theoretic conception.<span style="">  </span>Gauker argues instead that an argument is valid just in case in every context where the premises are assertible the conclusion is too. Chapter 3 is a comprehensive catalogue of argument forms involving conditionals to which Gauker applies his account, saying which forms he counts as valid and which he does not.<span style="">  </span>In cases where the result conflicts with our intuitions, Gauker tries to explain away our contrary intuitions in a sensible and systematic manner, where possible drawing upon independently motivated considerations.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">In the second section, chapter 4, Gauker compares his account of indicative conditionals with some of the leading rival accounts, including those of Stalnaker, Lycan, Barwise, and Lowe.<span style="">  </span>Gauker offers a number of well taken criticisms of his rivals but of particular interest here are his criticisms of Stalnaker. Stalnaker's account invalidates the <i>Disjunctions-to-Conditionals</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> argument form (<i>P</i></span>∨<span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>Q </i></span><span style="">⊢</span><span style="color:black;"> <span lang="EN-CA"><i>~P</i></span></span>→<span style=";font-family:Symbol;color:black;"   lang="EN-CA"><i><span style=""></span></i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>Q</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">) but there seem to be no intuitive counter-examples to this argument form.<span style="">  </span>Stalnaker himself tries to explain our inability to find such counter-examples but Gauker offers an extended, and I think convincing, argument to the effect that Stalnaker's explanation is inadequate and that we should therefore reject Stalnaker's theory.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">In the third section, chapters 5-7, Gauker goes on to develop a formal semantics for his account.<span style="">  </span>Though in many ways attractive, the core theory for indicative conditionals presented in chapter 5 has several defects, the most serious of which being that it invalidates several intuitively valid argument forms, including <i>Modus Tollens</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, <i>Contraposition</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, and <i>Conditionals-to-Disjunctions </i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(<i>P</i></span>→<span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>Q</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> </span><span style="">⊢</span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> ~<i>P</i></span>∨<span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>Q</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">).<span style="">  </span>Chapter 6 introduces the notions of <i>strong assertibility</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> and <i>strong deniability</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> and argues that although these argument forms are strictly invalid their instances are nevertheless, in many contexts, perfectly good arguments.<span style="">  </span>To capture the sense in which these argument forms are good, Gauker introduces the notion of <i>weak validity</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> -- where an argument is weakly valid just in case the strong assertibility of its premise guarantees the assertibility of its conclusion.<span style="">  </span>Chapter 7 extends Gauker's formal semantics to an attractive account of subjunctive conditionals.<span style="">  </span>One potentially attractive feature of this account is the fact that, although it treats indicative and subjunctive conditionals differently, the semantics given for subjunctive conditionals grows directly out of that given for indicative conditionals.<span style="">  </span>This allows Gauker to capture the similarities and differences between indicative and subjunctive conditionals: they are different but closely related sorts of creature validating different argument forms but governed by similar semantics.<span style="">  </span>Another attractive feature of Gauker's account is that while eschewing possible worlds semantics he is able to generate a logic for subjunctive conditionals very close to that of David Lewis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">The rest of the book is taken up with various ancillary but interesting issues.<span style="">  </span>Chapter 8 contains interesting discussions of "even if" and "only if" constructions together with quantified conditionals and the effects of asserting a series of conditionals with progressively strengthened, or weakened, antecedents.<span style="">  </span>Gauker's discussion of "even" is of independent interest here.<span style="">  </span>Chapter 9 concludes the book by providing an algorithm for deciding the validity of an argument presented in the formal language developed by Gauker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Although Gauker's program is in many ways very attractive I nevertheless have some substantial reservations about it.<span style="">  </span>More precisely, I have reservations concerning both the semantic framework within which Gauker develops his account of conditionals and this account itself.<span style="">  </span>I will sketch these in turn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">My primary complaint about Gauker's semantic framework is simply that Gauker has not done enough to spell out the central ideas of his theory.<span style="">  </span>We need a clearer account of conversational <i>goals</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> and how the goal of a conversation together with the objective state of the world <i>determines</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> the context for that conversation.<span style="">  </span>Clearly some simple conversations have obvious goals: the goal of our conversation might be to get you to pass me the salt or lend me your car.<span style="">  </span>But it is less clear, when we talk about the latest political campaign or exam results, what exactly the goals of our conversation might be. <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Again, it seems far from obvious how the goals of many conversations might determine their context.<span style="">  </span>To take two pointed examples, suppose I am worried that you think I do not speak English so I say something with the goal of informing you that I am Anglophone.<span style="">  </span>Or suppose that my goal is to engage in a filibuster.<span style="">  </span>It is hard to see how either of these goals could determine anything like context for my conversation in the sense that Gauker wants (i.e. a set of literals or a multi-context).<span style="">  </span>As he himself recognizes, Gauker<span style="">  </span>needs to provide a fully worked out account of these things if his semantics is to be taken seriously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">My worries about Gauker's account of conditionals are, I think, potentially more serious.<span style="">  </span>Any adequate account of conditionals should seek to validate those inferences involving conditional sentences which strike us as intuitively valid and to invalidate those which strike us as intuitively invalid.<span style="">  </span>And, in so far as it ends up counting certain intuitively valid forms of inference as invalid and certain intuitively valid forms of inference as invalid, it must explain why our intuitions are mistaken in these matters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Now although Gauker's theory certainly does not equate the indicative conditional with the material conditional, Gauker's account of indicative conditionals nevertheless validates the <i>Paradox of Material Implication </i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(<i>PMI</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">) argument forms (<i>P</i></span><span style="">⊢</span><span style="color:black;"> <span lang="EN-CA"><i>Q</i></span></span>→<span style=";font-family:Symbol;color:black;"   lang="EN-CA"><i><span style=""></span></i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>P</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> and ~<i>Q</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> </span><span style="">⊢</span><span style="color:black;"> <span lang="EN-CA"><i>Q</i></span></span>→<span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>P</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">) despite many people's intuitions to the contrary.<span style="">  </span>On the other hand <i>Modus Tollens</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, <i>Contraposition</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, and the <i>CTD </i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">argument form (<i>P</i></span>→<span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>Q</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> </span><span style="">⊢</span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> ~<i>P</i></span>∨<span style=";font-family:Symbol;color:black;"   lang="EN-CA"><i><span style=""></span></i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>Q</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">) come out as strictly speaking invalid for Gauker.<span style="">  </span>Gauker is well aware of these problems and tries with commendable care to soften these conflicts with our intuitions.<span style="">  </span>But I am not convinced he succeeds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Consider first Gauker's defence of the validity of the following (<i>PMI</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">) argument: <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(PMI*)<span style="">            </span><span style="">       </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin-left: 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><u>_______________<span style="">                              </span><i><span style=""> </span>I will meet you tomorrow</i></u><i> <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin-left: 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i><span style=""> </span>If I die tonight then I will meet you tomorrow<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Gauker suggests that there are two reasons why we mistakenly take this argument to be invalid.<span style="">  </span>Firstly we may mistake the indicative conditional for a subjunctive conditional and hence mistake the valid (PMI*) for the invalid (PMI+):<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(PMI+) <span style="">            </span><span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin-left: 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><u>_______________________<span style="">                                               </span><i>I will meet you tomorrow</i></u><i> <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin-left: 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i><span style=""> </span>If I were to die tonight then I would meet you tomorrow</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Secondly, and more importantly, Gauker suggests that when we evaluate (PMI*) we have a tendency to illegitimately switch contexts as we move from premise to conclusion so that we do not evaluate both the premise and conclusion with respect to the same context. More precisely, when I evaluate the premise I will not take my death tonight to be a relevant prospect but when I evaluate the conclusion, since we do not usually expect conditionals to be asserted when their antecedents are not relevant prospects, I will take this to be a relevant prospect.<span style="">  </span>Since my death tonight precludes my doing anything tomorrow, this prospect will be one where I do not meet you tomorrow.<span style="">  </span>And consequently, unlike the context <i>c </i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">with respect to which I evaluate the premise of (PMI*), the context <i>c*</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> with respect to which I evaluate its conclusion will be identical to or contain a context in which <i>I die tonight</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is assertible but <i>I will meet you tomorrow</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is not.<span style="">  </span>Hence, by (G), the conclusion of (PMI*) will not be assertible in <i>c*</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">. Since we switch between context <i>c</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> and context <i>c*</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> without realizing it when evaluating (PMI*) we mistakenly take the premise to be assertible in a context where the conclusion is not.<span style="">  </span>Hence we misjudge (PMI*) to be invalid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">The problem with these responses is that, even if they work for (PMI*), there are a host of similar arguments to which they do not apply.<span style="">  </span>Consider, for example, the arguments:<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(PMI**)<span style="">  </span><span style="">            </span><span style=""> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin-left: 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><u>________________________<span style="">                                                      </span><i>It will be hot tomorrow</i></u></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> <i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin-left: 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>If Sarah lives in Queensland then it will be hot tomorrow</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(PMI***)<span style="">  </span><span style="">            </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin-left: 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><u>_________________________<span style="">                                                      </span><i>1+1=2</i></u></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> <i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin-left: 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>If Sarah lives in Queensland then 1+1=2</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Many people find such arguments invalid but it is not clear how Gauker might explain this.<span style="">  </span>I think it implausible to suppose that we confuse the indicative conditionals in (PMI**) and (PMI***) with subjunctive conditionals.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, in contrast to the case of (PMI*), the prospect of Sarah living in Queensland does not seem to preclude its being hot tomorrow, let alone 1+1=2.<span style="">  </span>So it is not clear why the context relative to which we evaluate the conclusion of (PMI**) should be identical with or contain any contexts in which <i>it will be hot tomorrow</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> was not assertible.<span style="">  </span>Nor is it clear why the context relative to which we evaluate the conclusion of (PMI***) should be identical with or contain any contexts in which <i>1+1=2</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> was not assertible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Gauker is imaginative and ingenious and I have no doubt that he could come up with an alternative explanation of why many of us take (PMI**) and (PMI***) to be invalid.<span style="">  </span>But he would pay a price in doing so.<span style="">  </span>For I suspect that whatever the reasons why we take (PMI*)</span> -- <span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(PMI***) to be invalid, we take them both to be invalid for the <i>same</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> reasons.<span style="">  </span>And we should be wary of any account which had to resort to a series of different <i>ad hoc</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> manoeuvres to explain away our intuitions of invalidity in different cases, especially if those intuitions seem to have a common source.<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">My second problem with Gauker's account of conditionals is that while many of us are pessimistic about the prospects of any account of conditionals completely accommodating <i>all</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> our intuitions, I suspect that some of our intuitions are non-negotiable. Thus, for example, the validity of <i>Modus Ponens</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is surely a non-negotiable matter and any account of 'conditionals' on which <i>Modus Ponens</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> fails is probably best seen as not providing an account of <i>conditionals</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> at all, no matter how ingenious the arguments offered for why our intuitions on this matter are not to be trusted.<span style="">  </span>Now, of course, Gauker's account validates <i>Modus Ponens</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">.<span style="">   </span>But I think it is a serious question as to whether <i>Modus Tollens</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> and <i>Contraposition</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> are negotiable argument forms or whether any account of 'conditionals' on which these fail has departed unacceptably from our concept of a conditional. I, for one, am inclined to think that we accept these argument forms, not so much because we take their individual instances to be valid, and not so much because we cannot discern any counter-examples to them, but rather because it is simply part of our concept of the indicative conditional that <i>Modus Tollens</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> and <i>Contraposition</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> hold for it.<span style="">  </span>Obviously this claim requires more defence than I can provide here.<span style="">  </span>But as evidence in its favour I would note that in my experience, when confronted with a McGee-style counter-example to <i>Modus Tollens</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>If a Republican wins, then if Reagan does not win then Anderson will win.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i><u>It is not the case that if Reagan does not win then Anderson will win.<o:p></o:p></u></i></span></p>   <p class="BodyTextNDPR" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 35.4pt;"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>A Republican will not win.

</p> <p class="BodyTextNDPR"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">most people seem adamant that we should retain <i>Modus Tollens</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> and explain away the 'counter example' in some manner.<span style="">  </span>Obviously there is much more that needs to be said here but I worry that Gauker's account does too much violence to our intuitions.<span style="">   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>    <span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">I have raised some worries about Gauker's account.<span style="">  </span>This should not, however, detract from the fact that Gauker has produced an absolutely superb book which merits very serious attention.<span style="">  </span>Gauker has, in short, set a new benchmark in treatments of conditionals.</span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"></span>
