	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Christopher  Morris's anthology on <span class="SpellE">Amartya</span> <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> is part of the <i style="">Contemporary</i> <i style="">Philosophy in Focus</i> series from Cambridge University  Press. The series offers introductions to the thought of notable recent  philosophers. <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> is an excellent choice for  the series. His 1998 Nobel Prize recognized his achievements in welfare economics, but his  influence is also seminal in fields such as poverty and human development, ethical  theory, and social and political philosophy.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Along with his helpful  introduction, Morris assembled eight essays by distinguished philosophers, policy  theorists, and economists to provide critical overviews of key elements of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> thought. An anthology can only highlight  some features of a career that spans decades and whose output includes over <span class="GramE">two dozen</span> books and hundreds of articles and  chapters. Despite the magnitude of its subject, the collection hits Morris's  target: introduce readers who are unfamiliar with some or all of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> work to the range and power of his ideas. For ease of overview, I  discuss the essays from the standpoint of three broad categories: social choice  theory, issues in measurement and value, and themes in famine and development.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">First, much of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> work revolves around problems in social choice and related moral and  policy issues. Social choice theory, as <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> notes  in his Nobel lecture, considers how there can be reasonable claims about social judgment -- especially given deep value pluralism. The problem, in  short, is this: human beings are very different, yet there are times when we need  to consider what people taken together prefer, need, or believe, and often  we must square such assessments with individual persons' respective  entitlements. A further challenge is that sometimes we must consider what a group's  level of aggregate <span class="GramE">well-being</span> is, how it compares to  that of other groups, and how to improve it. <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> groundbreaking work has set much of the agenda for scholars working on  such topics.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Many of this volume's essays  address themes in social choice and aggregation; the essays by Kevin Roberts and  Peter <span class="SpellE">Vallentyne</span> address these issues in  detail. Roberts' contribution is a helpfully concise but demandingly technical account of  <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> achievements in aggregating  information in calculations of social choice. His chapter highlights how <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> <span class="SpellE">informationally</span> enriched approaches are  better than alternatives at measuring <span class="GramE">well-being</span> and  giving a basis for interpersonal comparisons. This chapter may be of special  interest to scholars well versed in quantitative methods from the social sciences.  Peter <span class="SpellE">Vallentyne's</span> essay addresses similar  themes and may seem daunting to formalism-shy readers, but his chapter is a rewarding and  clear survey of rival theories of justice, especially <span class="SpellE">sufficientarianism</span>, <span class="SpellE">prioritarianism</span>, and egalitarianism. He  explores in some detail <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> account of aggregate  poverty, its assumptions, and its limitations. His careful overview also considers  what a satisfactory distribution-sensitive theory of justice must include and  how it should assess improvements in human <span class="GramE">well-being</span>.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The next broad theme in the  essays concerns <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> work on measurement and  value. As Morris highlights in the introduction, <span class="SpellE">Sen</span>  rejects <span class="SpellE">welfarist</span> views, which reduce  assessments of <span class="GramE">well-being</span> to that of utility.  Such views wrongly ignore freedoms, capabilities, and other significant metrics of <span class="GramE">well-being</span>. The essay by <span class="SpellE">Shatakshee</span> <span class="SpellE">Dhongde</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prasanta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pattanaik</span>,  for instance, highlights <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> criticisms of  leading accounts of rational choice. As the authors note of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> view, a proper theory of rational choices includes preferences and  motives and abandons the implausible <i style="">homo <span class="SpellE">economicus</span></i>  picture of human beings. Our welfare is not purely a function of satisfying self-regarding welfare-enhancing  preferences. The authors discuss how we might mistakenly rush to the rescue of  rational choice theories with a more inclusive notion of self-regarding choice.  This is a familiar move in some recent work among thinkers inspired by Thomas  Hobbes (e.g., David Gauthier, Gregory <span class="SpellE">Kavka</span>, and  perhaps Lester Hunt). <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> is deeply suspicious of  such approaches. Instead, he proposes that sometimes another's goals will <i style="">displace</i> one's own.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Christopher Morris's essay  explores how <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> brings ethics to bear on  economics, especially in light of economists' legendary wariness of value-theoretic considerations. <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> 1970 <i style="">Collective Choice and Social Welfare </i>defends incorporating value claims in the  social sciences. Since we have no way to <i style="">show</i> conclusively that a value judgment is "basic" -- that the judgment "is supposed to apply under all conceivable circumstances" (here quoted on p. 41) -- then it becomes difficult if not impossible to <i style="">know</i> whether a given judgment is basic. There may then be room for some science that includes value claims.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Moral <span class="SpellE">skeptics</span> might wonder whether morality can fulfill its categorical pretensions,  and, if we cannot be sure that it does, whether we may include moral  considerations in economic analyses. <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> argues on the side of inclusion, and Morris takes <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> remarks as  a cue for exploring how and whether moral claims provide reasons. If they do  not provide reasons, then perhaps as <span class="SpellE">Sen</span>  suggests they might nevertheless "apply" to all agents. Such a view echoes <span class="SpellE">Philippa</span> Foot, who has defended the idea that  morality need not be inescapably binding in order for it to apply to all and provide  reasons to most.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> How morality might do this independently of agents' preferences may  strike some <span class="SpellE">skeptical</span> critics as mysterious. However,  Morris finds such <span class="SpellE">normativity</span> perfectly sensible.  His remarks here on <span class="SpellE">counterpreferential</span> choice  and <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> account of "commitment" briefly  but compellingly indicate why. (This theme also comes up in the chapters by  Sabina <span class="SpellE">Alkire</span> on human development and David  A. Crocker and Ingrid <span class="SpellE">Robeyns</span> on <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> capabilities framework.) As Morris indicates, sometimes <i style="">rules</i>  constrain agents' practical reasoning beyond what an  all-things-considered account of the balance of reasons might indicate. Sometimes agents have a reason to alter or even act against their preferences so that certain  options <span class="GramE">that norms</span> forbid no longer count in  the balance of reasons. This way, other persons, groups or causes with which one identifies, and  moral norms, might then each be targets of commitment that give reasons that  displace one's own preferences.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Phillip Pettit's essay  explores some of the contours and implications of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> view  of freedom as decisive preference. Pettit notes that <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> view allows mediated actions to be instances of freedom. Both <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> and Pettit agree that democratic institutions  sustain and amplify freedom. Pettit adds that either directly or indirectly,  actively or "virtually," citizens ensure that they are in a position to achieve their ends. Pettit here extends <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> multidimensional conception of freedom toward his own account of  republican freedom, which he has powerfully defended elsewhere.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup> Of note is Pettit's suggestion to add "status freedom" as a component of social assessments of freedom. On this view, freedom is simply a  distinctive social (and particularly <i style="">political</i>) "status" of equal inclusion and protection by those social and political institutions that sustain free choice. Thus conceived, there  is nothing to maximize. Pettit sees his account as being in the spirit of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> capabilities approach and potentially  improving on <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> "option"-based notion of  freedom. But it is not clear <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> would find it entirely  congenial.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Sen</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> seems to want a notion of freedom that gives us something  to measure and improve. But unlike <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span>  account, Pettit's status freedom is not a scalar notion. This might be a problem. Suppose previously disenfranchised persons were to gain some voting  rights but still lack the same protected powers as other citizens to own and  operate businesses, divorce, or travel. Under the status freedom account, it is  unclear how this extension of the franchise would be an <i style="">improvement</i>  in freedom. After all, the new voters are still unfree since they do not have the same status as others. Pettit may allow that  it is an improvement in other ways, but granting the vote seems to make  marginalized persons more free than they were previously. The status approach might  have difficulty accommodating this.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Pettit's republican freedom  captures the idea of people equally enjoying "a standing in which they can walk tall, conscious of being equally protected against others -- including the  state itself -- in a common domain of choice" (p. 110). When freedom is a status, it "does not wax and wane with marginal shifts in the  commodities or services over which choice can be exercised" (p. 110). Though it has republican roots, Pettit's view here is reminiscent of the role of  rights in liberal social theory -- at least as Joel Feinberg once described it.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup> In contrast with liberal pluralism, though, saying that freedom involves  choice in a "common domain" may strike some liberal critics as unduly monistic. (On Pettit's behalf, some liberals' <span class="SpellE">defense</span> of multiple, <span class="GramE">sometimes disparate</span> domains of  choice is not without difficulty.) Pettit's remark that the extent of freedom does  not depend on marginal shifts in availability of goods seems correct, but it  leaves open the possibility that freedom's extent might indeed <i style="">improve</i>  with <i style="">substantial</i> shifts in such goods. This may invite exactly the sort of scalar notion  of freedom that Pettit resists. Some readers may also wonder how republican freedom includes socially and politically protected powers to <i style="">exclude</i>. Such powers are at the heart of property <span class="GramE">rights which</span>, as <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> suggests in his writings and as Steven <span class="SpellE">Scalet</span>  and David <span class="SpellE">Schmidtz</span> defend in their contribution  to the collection, may be crucial ingredients in promoting human well-being. If  our notion of freedom allows and protects such powers, it may permit some inequalities that challenge the idea of completely equal republican citizenship.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Pettit concludes his account  on an optimistic note about the power of democracy to protect against  domination. We might agree at least in the spirit of Churchill: democracy might be the  best available option given all the other lousy alternatives. But it may be  unclear that democratic control is, as Pettit notes (p. 112), "no danger to freedom" -- even under a republican model of freedom. Readers curious about how Pettit would address such challenges would do well to study  his extensive published work on republicanism.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Certainly one of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> key contributions on the theme of measurement and value is his  capabilities approach. This is the focus of the chapter by David A. Crocker and  Ingrid <span class="SpellE">Robeyns</span>. They discuss in crisp  overview the roots of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> capability  framework and what role agency plays in his account. The relevant capabilities include real opportunities to  pursue goals and explore alternative beings and doings. Such capabilities  constitute a life's value. (Note again <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> approach is  richer than more monistic <span class="SpellE">welfarist</span> theories of  value.) The authors highlight how <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> framework puts  him at odds not just with many economic theories but with theories of justice such  as utilitarianism and <span class="SpellE">Rawlsian</span> liberalism. They  also helpfully note the significance of agency in <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> account (here complementing related remarks by Pettit) as a lens for  understanding, selecting, and weighing various capabilities in our measures of <span class="GramE">well-being</span>. Crocker and <span class="SpellE">Robeyns</span> amplify <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> views by providing both the  conditions of agency and presenting agency as a scalar phenomenon. The authors  close by highlighting some remaining challenges for scholars working on agency, including how to map <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> account on to  recent work on autonomy, collective agency, and value pluralism. I might add that  some ethicists' recent <span class="SpellE">skeptical</span> work on agency  as a central moral and political value<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup>  might challenge agency's place in an account of human <span class="GramE">well-being</span>.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The account of agency is  crucial when considering what it is about democratic institutions that, as <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> has written, prevented any famines in  modern-day democracies. This brings us to the third main theme in these essays,  that of famine and human development. Steven <span class="SpellE">Scalet</span>  and David <span class="SpellE">Schmidtz's</span> essay runs with <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> findings that famine is not mainly a supply problem. On the authors'  account, famine comes from "failed relationships among people regarding food" (p. 172) -- especially regarding property norms.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Scalet</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> and <span class="SpellE">Schmidtz</span> point to the  tragedy unfolding in Zimbabwe to illustrate the danger of distortive political  choices and inattention to market institutions. To be sure, as Sabina <span class="SpellE">Alkire</span> notes in her chapter, <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> does not defend any monistic approach to famine relief, and so he does  not see market institutions as the only resources for preventing poverty and  suffering. On <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> view, public action, cultural  norms, and government regulations are also likely some of the ingredients in the  mix needed to sustain <span class="GramE">well-being</span>.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Drawing on related work by  Hernando de Soto, <span class="SpellE">Scalet</span> and <span class="SpellE">Schmidtz</span> discuss how government bureaucracy impedes exactly the sort of  creativity needed to get people the food they need. Indeed, in contrast with much  recent development scholarship, hungry persons are not so ignorant and poor  that only western aid can save them. As <span class="SpellE">Scalet</span> and <span class="SpellE">Schmidtz</span> note, they have the drive and the  resources to feed themselves but can leverage neither to their advantage. There are  tragic institutional gaps (such as the lack of credit mechanisms) and ghastly political failures that obstruct efficient property institutions. Taking  a cue from <span class="SpellE">Sen</span>, the authors suggest that dealing  with hunger might call for insightfully unleashing untapped social capital.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Sabina <span class="SpellE">Alkire's</span> essay presents an overview of some of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span>  seminal work on development. <span class="SpellE">Alkire</span> describes <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> multidimensional theory as emphasizing human development over growth-oriented development. <span class="SpellE">Alkire</span> highlights some of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> empirical work in  measuring poverty, the substantive problems (including perverse policy  implications) of competing measures, and glances at the rich literature <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> non-welfare-based poverty measure generated.<b style=""> </b><span class="SpellE">Alkire</span> also discusses the controversy surrounding <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> research on "missing women." <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> claims that tens of millions of females have  somehow disappeared over the past few decades. Because of some developing  countries' social norms, these missing females are the persons who either could  have been born but were not, or they were born but did not make it into adulthood.  The results are unsustainable demographic imbalances in many developing  countries.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Alkire</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> discusses some of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> work  on population. In contrast to the repeatedly disproven predictions of  professional Malthusian worriers such as Paul Ehrlich, <span class="SpellE">Sen</span>  has been among scholars resisting the ideas of a "population bomb" and the draconian state-sanctioned policies to defuse it. Indeed, many  societies now face exactly the opposite challenge: too few babies are born to sustain  many entrenched social and economic institutions (especially the welfare  state apparatus). <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> defends a decentralized <span class="SpellE">noncoercive</span> shift in norms regarding  childbearing, secondary to improvements in educational and health care opportunities.  Such shifts would respectfully promote sustainable population trends.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The essays in Morris's  anthology offer a clear guide to key aspects of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> thought.  This multidisciplinary collection should be of interest to both experts and  novices. The distinguished contributors distill <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span>  position and influence in many fields. The essays are appetizers to further study  of <span class="SpellE">Sen's</span> provocative work and the  literatures to which he has been such a major contributor.</span></p>    <div style="">
