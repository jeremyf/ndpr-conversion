	C<span lang="EN-AU">onsciousness is a hot topic these days, what with  online conferences, associations for its scientific study, and the like,  and Kriegel's book is squarely in the middle of this ferment. Kriegel's  aim is to provide a comprehensive theory of phenomenal consciousness.  As a lot of what I have to say will be critical, let me state up front  that in many ways I really like the book. For one thing, it combines an  impressive attention to the empirical side of the matter with a  genuinely philosophical treatment. And though the book is quite long, it  reads easily and is not repetitive. There are new ideas and arguments  in every section, far too many to survey and evaluate here. And though I  find some of the arguments unconvincing and ill-considered, with  Kriegel the rule is: you don't like that one, well I have three more for  you to consider. The question is, what does it all add up to? So let me  proceed to try to answer that question by first providing an overview  of the main line of argument of the book. Kriegel has a complicated  story to tell, so bear with me, as even a brief presentation of it can't  be brief enough. I'll do my best.</span>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">We begin with a distinction that I myself emphasized in  Levine (2001). Consider a paradigm conscious experience, such as the one  you have when looking at a ripe tomato in daylight. What seems to be  distinctive of this mental state as a conscious experience can be  divided into two components: what Kriegel calls its "subjective  character" (I called it "subjectivity") and its "qualitative character".  One way to get at the distinction is by way of the standard "what it's  like" locution. When we say that there is something it is like for me to  see a ripe tomato on the kitchen counter in daylight, that there is  something at all it is like for me is the subjective character, and  precisely what it is like for me is the qualitative character. All  conscious experiences share subjective character, but they differ in  their qualitative character.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Phenomenal consciousness, according to Kriegel, is that  feature of mental life that is responsible for the "explanatory gap"  (Levine 1983) and the "hard problem" (Chalmers 1996). While most  philosophers have grappled with qualitative character, Kriegel argues  that it is really subjective character that is at the heart of the  problem. Still, as phenomenal consciousness is composed of both kinds of  character, and he seeks a fairly comprehensive theory of phenomenal  consciousness, Kriegel provides an account of qualitative character  alongside his principal account of subjective character.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Kriegel's theory is called the  "self-representational" theory of phenomenal consciousness. Subjective  character is that feature of a conscious state by virtue of which there  is something it is like for the subject. But being "for the subject",  according to Kriegel, means being something of which the subject is  aware. Kriegel defends this claim by way of defending the "ubiquity  thesis", the thesis that every conscious state is a state of which we  are aware. Once we grant this, we then need to analyze "awareness",  which, according to Kriegel, is best understood in terms of  representation. As will become clear by the end of this review, it is  this move that I believe leads to all the problems. Kriegel rightly  notes that analyzing awareness in terms of representation is a  substantive hypothesis, and defends it on the grounds that it is the  only model for which we have a clear model and with which we have some  prior familiarity, not to mention that the representational model more  easily allows for physicalistic reduction. So the upshot of this first  stage of investigation is the view that a state has subjective character  by virtue of being represented to be a state of the subject.</span></p>   <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Now this much had already  been argued by "higher-order" theorists, most notably David Rosenthal  (1997). Rosenthal emphasizes that conscious states are those we are <i>conscious  of</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, which turn out to be those  represented by suitably related higher-order thoughts. Where Kriegel  differs from Rosenthal is that Kriegel claims that the higher-order  state and the first-order state are in fact one and the same; hence the  self-representation referred to in the name of the theory.  Kriegel  offers several arguments for preferring the single-state  self-representation theory to the standard two-state higher-order  theory, a matter to which I'll return. </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">When it comes to qualitative  character, Kriegel holds a narrow representational view. According to a  representational view, qualitative character is identified with the  representational content of a perceptual or sensory representation. So,  for example, the reddish qualitative character of a visual experience of  a ripe tomato is the property of representing the tomato to be red. At  this point, representational theories divide over how to understand the  relevant representational content. Externalist representationalists take  the relevant content to be something like a spectral reflectance, a  mind-independent and response-independent property of the object  (Dretske 1995 and Tye 1995). Kriegel opts for a different view. He  identifies qualitative character with the representation of a certain  response-dependent property of the object: that disposition of the  object to cause certain neural states in organisms of the relevant type  under normal conditions. As he notes, his view is internalist, in the  sense that qualitative character supervenes on the physical structure of  the perceiver, whereas for externalists it supervenes on the way the  world is outside the head as well.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This is how Kriegel describes his view in chapter 3, but,  as he warns the reader there, there is actually a crucial amendment to  the view that appears in chapter 4. It turns out that the first-order  content of the representational state does not determine the state's  qualitative character after all. Rather, to find out what the  qualitative character is, we have to look at the higher-order content of  the state -- the self-representational component of the state's  content.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">To see  how this works, consider again the visual experience of the ripe tomato.  This conscious state has a first-order content that attributes a  particular response-dependent property (among others) -- call it R -- to  the tomato. At the second-order level, the state represents itself as  having a certain content -- say, as attributing R to the tomato. The  first-order content he calls the "schmalitative character" of the  conscious state, and the content attributed to the state by the  second-order content is the qualitative character strictly speaking. Of  course in standard cases these contents will coincide, so the  schmalitative and qualitative characters will be the same. But sometimes  they may come apart. One's visual system may be representing the tomato  as instantiating R, but one may be representing oneself to be  representing the tomato as instantiating G. In such a case the  qualitative character of the experience is G, not R.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Getting back to subjective  character, an important part of the story for Kriegel involves a  distinction between "peripheral" and "focal" inner awareness. As applied  to normal, outer-directed perceptual attention the distinction is  familiar. As I type this review on my computer, I see the words on the  screen, but also the envelopes on my desk, the keyboard, and a number of  other objects in my field of vision. I am visually attending to the  words on the screen -- and not to all of them, of course, but the ones  appearing as I type -- they occupy my focal attention. But I am also  aware of the other objects; certainly in a way that I am not visually  aware of the door behind my back. We can describe these other objects of  which I'm visually aware as occupying the periphery of my visual  attention.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The  application to inner awareness is meant to capture the difference  between standard cases of conscious perceptual experience, on the one  hand, and full-blown introspective attention to experience, on the  other. As I'm looking at the computer screen while typing I am  consciously aware of the words as they appear on the screen, and it's  clear that my attention is directed toward the screen, not myself or my  experience. Yet, if this is to count as a conscious experience, there  must be some sense in which it is "for me", and, for Kriegel, this means  it's being represented by me. Kriegel captures the difference between  the two objects of awareness - the screen and the experience of the  screen - by appeal to the difference between peripheral and focal  attention. I am focally aware of the screen, but only peripherally aware  of my experience. Once we have this distinction in play, we can then  say that what happens when I indulge in full-blown introspection is that  an attention shift takes place. Whereas before I was focally aware of  the screen and peripherally aware of the experience, now I am focally  aware of the experience.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">At the end of chapter 4, Kriegel provides a full-dress  articulation of his account of subjective character, which goes like  this:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">(SR) Necessarily, for any mental state M, M has subjective  character iff M is non-derivatively, specifically, and essentially  self-representing.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Non-derivative representation is the sort that minds do, as  opposed to the representation of the words on my screen. Specific  self-representation involves picking out the state in question through a  singular representation, as opposed to some general description it  happens to fall under, such as "all the mental states I'm now  occupying". Finally, essential self-representation is the sort one has  with first-person indexicals like "I" and "me", as opposed to definite  descriptions that happen to pick one out. So "the mental state  representing the computer screen" doesn't count, while "this very mental  state" does.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">So  does this theory work? Does it give a convincing account of phenomenal  consciousness? I don't think so. In fact, I find the position riddled  with holes. I will confine my critical remarks to three important  issues: the argument for abandoning the two-state higher-order theory  for the self-representational theory, the account of qualitative  character, and the ontological structure of conscious states on the  self-representational view.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">1. Kriegel's principal argument that we need  self-representation, as opposed to standard two-state higher-order  representation, goes like this. On a two-state view, only the  lower-order state is conscious, not the higher-order one (unless, as is  usually not the case, it is targeted by yet a higher-order state  itself). But clearly subjective character, the conscious state's being  "for me", is itself "phenomenologically manifest", and thus must be  conscious. If we grant this requirement, we are off on an infinite  regress, unless we stop the regress in its tracks by the one-state  self-representational move.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Why must we say that the higher-order state is conscious as  well? Kriegel realizes that appealing to the intuition that it is  phenomenologically manifest will not convince his opponents, so he trots  out an interesting argument, which goes like this. If subjective  character were not something itself of which we were conscious -- which,  on the standard two-state view, it isn't -- then how would we know  about it in the first place? That is, on what basis would we argue that  all conscious states have subjective character? He discusses various  options and dismisses them, leaving only the claim that it is because  subjective character is phenomenologically part of every conscious  experience do we know that it is an essential component of phenomenally  conscious states.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">One  option Kriegel dismisses is that we know about subjective character  through introspection. He has two objections to this view. First, since  the vast majority of our conscious states are not explicitly  introspected, the fact that we find subjective character in the ones we  do introspect provides an insufficient inductive basis to project to the  rest. But if every time we introspect we discover this feature of our  conscious experience, under all circumstances, why wouldn't this be  sufficient evidence? Why think the un-introspected ones are any  different? This is where the second objection comes into play. Since  when we introspect we are obviously making ourselves aware of our  conscious state, there is reason to think that the sample is biased.  Yes, we find subjective character when introspecting, but that's just  what the introspecting itself is introducing, and therefore we shouldn't  consider these cases as representative of all conscious states.</span></p>   <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">But this objection confuses  two distinct levels of higher-order representation. On the standard  higher-order theory, introspection involves three levels of  representation: the ground-level perceptual state, representing whatever  it does about the external world; the second-order state, representing  the ground-level one, and thus making it conscious; and a third-order  state, representing the second-order one (or maybe both second-order and  ground-level), constituting the introspective state. True, the  third-level state only appears when introspecting, but of course it  isn't the state of which we are conscious in these circumstances (unless  we go ahead and introspect the introspecting, thus introducing a  fourth-order state). What we are conscious of when introspecting is the  second-order state, and there is no reason to think that the  introduction of the extra level of awareness through introspecting is  responsible for introducing this second-order state that is found there.  Thus there is no reason to think the introspected sample is biased.  Hence, no real argument against the two-state view.<sup><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[1]</span></a></sup></span></p>   <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">2. Remember, for Kriegel  qualitative character is the representation of a response-dependent  property of the object. (For present purposes I'm ignoring the  qualitative/schmalitative distinction.) Any such account has to find a  way to independently characterize the relevant response, on pain of  circularity. As mentioned above, Kriegel's move is to go neural. But  then he notices a problem: namely, if we specify the relevant response  neurally, then we lose multiple realizability. It will turn out that no  two creatures who are physiologically different can ever have an  experience with the same qualitative character. Kriegel's response is to  claim that we can characterize the relevant response as a "conjunctive  disposition". It's the property of eliciting R1 in creatures of kind K1  in circumstances C1, and R2 in creatures of kind K2, in circumstances  C2, etc.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">So,  let's work out a case. Norma is looking at the sky and having an  experience with bluish quality, Stella is looking at the sky and having  an experience of the same quality, and Norman is looking at the sky and  having an experience of yellowish quality. We want to say that all three  experiences are (or at least can be) veridical. That means the sky must  have both properties, what Norma and Stella represent it to have and  what Norman represents it to have. These can't be the same property, for  then it would follow that Norma and Norman are experiencing the same  qualia, and, by hypothesis, they aren't. So they have to be two distinct  properties instantiated by the sky at the time in question.</span></p>   <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">According to Kriegel, these  are response-dependent properties. The issue then is to specify the  response without appealing to qualitative character itself, on pain of  undermining the reductive character of the account. As just mentioned,  Kriegel proposes to use physical properties as the relevant responses,  and then to deal with multiple realization of qualitative character by  appeal to "conjunctive dispositions". So what makes Norma's and Stella's  experiences both count as of bluish quality, given that Norma's  involves physical state N1 and Stella's involves N2? Well, it's that  they represent the same property B. What is B? It's the conjunctive  disposition to cause N1 in Norma (and her relevant peers) and N2 in  Stella (and her relevant peers).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Okay, so now we have Norma, Norman, and Stella all looking  at the sky together. Each is responding with a different physical  state, N1 for Norma, N2 for Stella, and N3 for Norman. However, Norma  and Stella are experiencing the same quality by virtue of their  representing B, which is defined in terms of causing N1 in Norma and N2  in Stella, but Norman's response is not among the dispositional  conjuncts of B, so he isn't sharing their qualitative experience. But of  course there's property C, which does include all three conjuncts. So  what makes it the case that it's B they are representing and not C?</span></p>   <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Perhaps Kriegel will say  that you start out with an intuitive grasp of Norma and Stella sharing a  quality and Norman not, and then fashion your specification of the  response to fit this. But this seems unworkable for two reasons. First,  on what theory of representation -- particularly some sort of nomic or  teleological theory of the sort Kriegel likes -- are you going to get it  to come out that it's precisely B and not C (or any other of the  infinitely many conjunctive dispositions one can specify) that Norma and  Stella are representing? Second, it clearly relies on an independent  fix on qualitative character, one that is totally ungrounded on this  account. Of course if you give up multiple realizability, so there's one  response for each possible physical state caused by seeing an object,  then this particular problem goes away, but then you get others.</span></p>   <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">3. Perhaps the most serious  question Kriegel addresses is how to understand the self-representation  relation itself. That is, what makes it the case that a state  represents itself? If Kriegel were not interested in a reductive theory  of consciousness he could avoid the problem and just take the  representation relation as primitive, and thus self-representation as  primitive as well. But Kriegel wants a naturalistic theory, so he must  rely on a naturalistic account of representation.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Unfortunately, the only  candidates we know of are causal/nomic accounts on the one hand, and  functional accounts on the other. The former don't help much with  self-representation, since states don't cause themselves. (The problem  is basically that either everything represents itself on such a view or  nothing does.) Functional role accounts might work, but then we lose  something else that is crucial to Kriegel: the categorical, or manifest  nature of self-awareness. After all, straight representationalist  theories of phenomenal consciousness -- without any explicit  higher-order representation -- handle subjective character in terms of a  disposition to be available to various high-level processes, such as  report and action planning.<sup><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[2]</span></a></sup>  Kriegel's main reason for insisting on explicit higher-order  representation is that without it the self-awareness of subjective  character loses its status as a categorical state, and thus ceases to be  the sort of thing that can be phenomenologically manifest. But if we  adopt a functional account of self-representation, then we lose this  advantage over the straight representationalist position, and we might  as well abandon any appeal to higher-order representation, whether of  the two-state or the one-state variety.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Note that the two-state view  doesn't have this problem. The two-state view can help itself to  whatever causal or nomic theory of representation eventually wins out,  since there is no obvious reason one mental state couldn't stand in this  relation to another. So what Kriegel does to solve his problem is to  compromise a bit with the two-state view. That is, rather than what I  will call a "one-vehicle-one-state" view, Kriegel holds a  "two-vehicle-one-state" view. On the former, though the physical state  realizing the self-representational mental state has physical parts, it  does not break down into representational components with one  representing the other. On the latter model, however, there are  separable parts of the state, such that one part represents the distal  situation and the second represents the first part. Since there is a  physical distinction between the two parts of the one state, it is  possible to employ some sort of causal account of representation to  ground the second part's representing the first part.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Of course now the problem is to  distinguish this two-vehicle-one-state view from the standard two-state  view. After all, calling two states "one state" doesn't make them so,  and since the representational contents of these two parts of the one  state are distinct, there seems to be every reason to consider them two  states. Kriegel responds in two ways. First, he claims that there is a  difference between a view that treats two states as parts of one state  merely by "summing" them, and one that treats them as parts of one state  by virtue of their standing in a relation that genuinely integrates  them into a "complex" state. The integration he has in mind involves the  kind of "binding" of two representations that we see in normal  perception. In perception the visual system must integrate a  representation that something is red with a representation that  something is square -- representations realized in different visual  sub-systems -- to get a representation of something that is a red  square, and one hypothesis for how this is done has to do with  synchronous firing in the two sub-systems. Kriegel proposes that just  this sort of integration occurs between the first-order and the  second-order representations involved in a conscious perceptual  experience (hence he calls this "cross order integration"), and he  speculates that synchronous firing could be the mechanism that  implements the integration in this case as well.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The second element in the  response is to introduce the idea of "indirect representation". The  point is that we want the entire state to be what's represented, not  just one part by another, for otherwise we wouldn't have any advantage  over the standard two-state view, since the subjective character would  not itself be phenomenologically manifest, since not self-represented.  But we can only get a causal account going if we have one part  representing the other, and therefore not representing itself. The way  out is to claim that the causal account gives us the "direct"  representation of the first-order part by the second-order part, and the  entire state counts as self-represented by virtue of the second-order  part's "indirectly" representing the entire, complex state. A case that  exemplifies the distinction is the way a picture can represent a house,  indirectly, by directly representing (picturing) the front of the house.  Similarly, the visual system always has only partial access to what's  being viewed, yet, by directly representing what's in the field of  vision, it indirectly represents an entire object, including parts that  are occluded from vision. Basing his account on this sort of analogy,  Kriegel claims that the second-order part of the conscious state  indirectly represents the entire state by directly representing the  first-order part.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">It  seems to me that neither the appeal to cross-order integration nor to  indirect representation works.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><sup>[</sup><sup>3]</sup></span></a>  Consider again the way that representations of color and shape are  bound together. It's supposed to work something like this. We start with  two distinct representations of the form "x is red" and "y is square",  where the singular terms are keyed to features maps. Through some  implementing mechanism (maybe synchronous firing) the two  representations become one and we get "z is red and square". The point  is that the latter representation, with "z" representing the object, is  distinct (functionally, that is) from either of the other two. Now, what  sort of merging of first-order and second-order contents on Kriegel's  view is supposed to work like that? We are given no idea how the  relevant contents are supposed to be merged.<sup><a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[4]</span></a></sup>  What's more, if they were integrated in anything like the way that  standard binding works, we'd have a one-vehicle model after all.</span></p>   <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Let me elaborate on this  last point. When individuating mental states, there are (at least) two  levels of aggregation to consider: the physical implementation level and  the psychological level (the level of the virtual machine). What are  counted as individual psychological states may be implemented by  extremely complex physical states, containing physical state parts that  are integrated in various ways. The part-whole structure of the physical  implementation, however, does not automatically transfer to the  psychological state(s) implemented. It depends on whether these physical  parts receive a psychological interpretation.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Now, on Kriegel's story we start  with two states, S1 and S2, where S1 is a representation of a ripe  tomato, and S2 represents that S1 is occurring. Now suppose that they  are integrated via something like synchronous firing. The physical  integration is irrelevant to the question of whether or not we have one  state unless there is a genuine merger of the contents of the two  states. But what sort of merger are we talking about? If it's still the  case that S1 represents the ripe tomato and S2 represents S1, in what  sense do we have a single psychological state? If, however, the S1 and  S2 contents genuinely merge -- so that either, as in the binding case, a  representational element from both parts functions as a single symbol<sup><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[5]</span></a></sup>,  or somehow the two parts function to spread the two representational  contents over the entire combined state -- then it's unclear why the  psychological state is considered to have two distinct parts. Again, the  two-part structure at the physical implementation level is irrelevant.  Kriegel's attempt to have it both ways -- two states in one -- exchanges  the mystery of consciousness for the mystery of the Trinity.</span></p>   <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">But suppose this could  work. (After all, many people do believe in the Trinity.) There is still  the question of what precisely is being represented at the higher-order  level. Does S2 represent just S1, or the combined S1-S2 state? As  mentioned above, Kriegel needs it to be the latter, for if it isn't,  then the advantage over the two-state version is lost. The principal  advantage of the one-state view over the two-state view is supposed to  be that it makes subjective character itself phenomenologically  manifest. Being phenomenologically manifest, on Kriegel's theory, is to  be represented. So the representing of S1, done by S2, must itself be  somehow represented. This is where the appeal to indirect representation  is supposed to do the job.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">But how does this work? Again, we are given examples that  are importantly unlike the situation at hand. Pictures and perceptual  experiences represent entire objects by picturing (or seeing) their  parts. But is that what happens? True, I say I see the house when I see  its front, but does that mean my visual system is literally representing  the whole house <i>by virtue of</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">  representing the front of it? And is the whole house phenomenologically  manifest to me? It seems to me that one might say I represent the entire  house in thought based on the visual presentation of the front, thus  yielding two representations, not one with both direct and indirect  contents. The problem is that we just have no clear model of indirect  representation that would help us determine if its application in this  case yields a position that meets the necessary desiderata.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">On page 230 Kriegel worries  about this problem, but treats it as relatively unimportant. To my mind  this issue strikes at the heart of his theory. Again, if the  higher-order (part of the) state is not represented, then we aren't  aware of it, and then we have no fundamental difference between this  view and standard higher-order theory. It's not enough that somehow the  entire state is indirectly represented if that doesn't amount to an  awareness of the subjective character itself. In fact, at an earlier  point in his argument a similar problem arose, and there too it seemed  to me that Kriegel brushed it off too quickly with an expedient that  doesn't really speak to the problem.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">When initially laying out his argument against the  two-state view, Kriegel set it up as a dilemma: either the higher-order  state is itself unconscious (bad, for reasons discussed above) or it's  conscious, but then we invite a regress of increasingly higher-order  states. At that point he considers an objection that his view is subject  to a regress of sorts as well. After all, even if there's one state,  aren't there two contents, the first-order one and the second-order one?  But can't we ask whether a <i>content</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, as  well as a state, is conscious? If so, then the same dilemma ought to  work against Kriegel's own view. His response is to say that for a  content to be conscious is just for it to be the (or a) content of a  conscious state. So the higher-order content needn't be itself  represented by another content to be conscious, since it is already a  content of a conscious state; that is, of a state that is the explicit  target of the higher-order content itself.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">But while this move allows  Kriegel to call the higher-order content "conscious", and I can't object  to a stipulation here, it doesn't seem to do the work we need done,  which is to get subjective character into our awareness. If we're going  to understand awareness as representation, then the content of awareness  has to be identified with representational content. I don't see how we  can allow something to count as what we're aware of by, as it were,  proxy -- which is what this move and the indirect representation move  seem to have in common.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Finally, now that we have Kriegel's two-vehicle-one-state  model presented, we can return to the other argument I mentioned in note  1 against the two-state view. The problem is that on the two-state  model it ought to be possible for the higher-order state to occur even  though there is no lower-order state it is actually representing. We can  think of this as a kind of internal hallucination. I represent myself  as having an experience I'm not actually having. The problem is that it  seems to undermine the relational character of the higher-order view.  If, as we assume would be the case on this view, what it's like for one  suffering such an internal hallucination is just the same as what it's  like for someone really having the represented experience, then it seems  that the internal hallucinator is really having the experience as well.  But this then makes the lower-order state superfluous.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Whether or not one finds this  problematic, Kriegel thinks it is, and therefore he argues that his  self-representational account is better since it isn't subject to this  objection. Since the state is representing itself, the higher-order  representation cannot occur without the lower-order state it is  representing, namely, itself. But once we adopt the two-vehicle version  of the one-state view, the objection reappears. Why couldn't S2 occur  without S1? Now Kriegel will say that since S1 isn't there, and so there  is no state with which S2 can integrate, there is no basis for the  indirect representational content; therefore the relevant higher-order  representational content does not appear without the state it's  representing -- that is, the integrated state consisting of S1 and S2.  While that's certainly right, we still want to know, according to  Kriegel, what it's like for the subject. Is there any reason to think he  can avoid the same dilemma that faces the two-state view? I don't see  why. Remember, given his view that qualitative character, the "what" of  what it's like, is identified by the representational content of the  higher-order state, not the lower-order one, is there any basis in his  theory for thinking that in an S2-without-S1 situation it would be any  different for the subject than it is when we have the full-fledged  S2-with-S1 situation?</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">What then to make of these various problems with the view?  Is there a lesson here? To me, the lesson is that consciousness really  is like the Trinity in the end. Somehow conscious awareness has a  differentiable act-object structure but of a sort that involves genuine,  not superficial, unity. This is why I have come to believe that the  awareness relation involved in conscious experience cannot be explicated  in terms of representational states, at least not reductively, as one  must either sacrifice the phenomenology or sacrifice the representation  relation. Kriegel has done us the service of showing us the limits of  the representational approach through his long and arduous attempt to  make it all work.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU"><i>References</i></span></p>   <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Chalmers, D.
