	  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Thomas Aquinas thinks that there are ten and  only ten wholly distinct, basic types of beings. That is, the list of ten  categories given by Aristotle is exhaustive, and no category overlaps with or  reduces to any other category. Aquinas makes some claims which suggest that the  list of the Aristotelian categories can be justified by examining the different  ways in which something is predicated of another. But precisely how Aquinas  thinks that this can be done is not entirely clear. In this book, Paul Symington  offers a new interpretation of Aquinas's proposed system of deriving and  justifying the ten Aristotelian categories. Moreover, Symington claims that Aquinas's  method can be fruitfully adapted to contemporary discussions of the categories.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">After a brief introductory chapter, Symington  presents a critique of earlier presentations of Aquinas's derivation of the ten  categories and then offers a new interpretation of Aquinas's derivation (chapter  1). Specifically, in Symington's view, earlier interpreters (most notably  John Wippel) have failed to appreciate the way in which Aquinas utilizes the different senses in which one thing can be predicated <i style="">per se</i>  of another thing. With this new interpretation established, Symington then turns to Duns Scotus's critique of any system of  derivation which starts from facts about linguistic predication and concludes with  claims about being (chapter 2). After surveying Scotus's arguments against this  kind of approach, Symington returns to Aquinas, presents yet another  reconstruction of Aquinas's method, and then answers Scotus on Aquinas's behalf  (chapter 3). Finally, Symington shifts to the contemporary debate over the derivation  of categories (chapter 4). He focuses on the four category scheme  articulated by E. J. Lowe. He examines the method that Lowe uses to derive his four  categories and then demonstrates how Aquinas's method can be used to derive the  same four categories. Symington then argues that Aquinas's method of derivation is superior to Lowe's, since it avoids a key difficulty that Lowe's theory  faces.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">I will say very little about Symington's dispute  with previous interpreters of Aquinas. Symington's interpretation is a  contender for understanding Aquinas's method of derivation, provided that Symington is  right that Aquinas intends to ultimately establish the ten categories by  appealing to modes of predication. Below, I will question whether this proviso is  true.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">I was puzzled that Symington provides <i style="">two</i> more or less independent presentations of Aquinas's method. The first appears after he has  surveyed previous contemporary scholarship on Aquinas's method (chapter 1); the  second is given right before he responds to Scotus's critique (chapter 3). (In  fact, I would recommend that readers begin with Symington's <i style="">second</i>  presentation of Aquinas's method for deriving the categories [pp. 92-109]. Here Symington finally steps back and examines Aquinas's underlying assumptions about being, which sheds some much needed light  on Aquinas's method.) This duplication is one of many symptoms of a deeper  problem with this book. Symington's work is not an integrated whole. Rather, it  appears to be a collection of related papers, perhaps originally drawn from a  more unified dissertation, which have been hurriedly pieced back together.  This lack of integrity manifests itself in other ways which make this book more  difficult to read than it should be.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Clearly, Symington wants this book to appeal not  only to specialists in medieval philosophy but also to contemporary metaphysicians.  Unfortunately, I suspect that many contemporary metaphysicians will find chapters 1  through 3 a bit daunting. No real effort is made to introduce readers to the jungle  of Aristotelian distinctions at work. For example, we have terms of "first" and "second intention"; we have a distinction between not only <i style="">per se</i> and <i style="">per accidens</i>  being, but also <i style="">per se</i> and <i style="">secundum se</i>  being. We are told that Aquinas distinguishes between four kinds of <i style="">per se</i> predication, three of which are relevant for deriving categories. (To make matters  more confusing, in chapter 4 the modes of predication that are deemed to be important are reduced to two.) It is only once we reach chapter 4 that Symington stops and attempts to translate medieval distinctions into a contemporary idiom (pp. 132-33). But by this point, I suspect that many a contemporary metaphysician will have given up on the book.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In general, the introduction misses several  opportunities to contextualize the highly specific and highly technical proceedings in  the main parts of the book. We get the history of interpretation and debate  over Aristotle's categories in fits and starts. For instance, we do not learn  until chapter 2 -- after we have looked at Aquinas -- that there was a debate  among the early medieval schools over whether the categories were words,  concepts, or things (p. 51). Only a modest effort is made to characterize the impact  that Aquinas's theory had on the thirteenth-century thinkers between Aquinas  and Scotus. While it is true that the period between Aquinas and Scotus  requires further study, we do know of some developments that are crucial for understanding what Scotus was doing when he criticized any and all  attempts to derive the categories of being from predication.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Instead, the introductory chapter is mostly an  ahistorical and highly general survey of categories as such. But even this has its problems. We are told that there are numerous issues pertaining to  categories. Indeed, we get several lists of them (see pp. 3-4, p. 7, and p. 11). But  these questions are often raised only to be ignored. For example, there is the question whether categories are things, and if so, what <i style="">sort</i>  of things they are. (Are they Platonic archetypes, immanent universals, sets, collections of particulars, or something else?) It is  fairly clear that all three protagonists in this book think that categories are  items or features of mind-independent reality. But while there are some  passing remarks about Lowe's position (see, e.g., p. 158), there is no prominent statement of Aquinas's or Scotus's view on what kind of thing a category  is. Symington asserts that all three protagonists are <i style="">Aristotelian</i>  realists, but anyone at all familiar with this family of theories knows that the term "Aristotelian" is often liberally applied.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">No real effort is made to justify the focus on  realism and, specifically, Aquinas's version of Aristotelian realism. In the  end, this is a book about Aquinas's theory of the categories; Lowe and Scotus turn  out to be foils. However, it would be nice to see some motivation for  Aristotelian realism, especially since Symington makes no secret of his allegiance to  the approach favored by Aquinas. It is also odd that Symington altogether  ignores other medieval positions on the categories, such as, most glaringly, the reductivist "Aristotelian" position of Ockham. Like Aquinas, Scotus claims that there are ten and only ten categories, but Scotus thinks  that this fact <i style="">cannot be proved</i>. In short, it seems that we are witnessing an internecine feud and that we are not  going to get a thorough vetting of Aquinas's position.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">It should be appreciated that Scotus is  attacking a <i style="">family</i> of methods for deriving the categories from facts about predication, because I think this truth  lessens the impact of Symington's defense of Aquinas from Scotus's assault. I agree  with Symington that, on the whole, Scotus's specific arguments against this  family of methods fail to undermine Aquinas's position. But they fail to do  much harm to Aquinas's theory because Scotus seems to be aiming his arguments at positions advocated by <i style="">Scotus's</i> near contemporaries. Many of these theories were perhaps <i style="">inspired</i>  by Aquinas's method of deriving the categories from modes of predication, but the targeted theories seem to have started from  different assumptions about the nature of predication and the nature of being  itself. We learn that Aquinas holds an "inherence" theory of predication, whereas Scotus assumes that his targets subscribe to an "identity" theory. Aquinas thinks that something's essence must be distinguished  from its existence; Scotus believes that they are one and the same. Scotus's  criticisms also rely on a theory of language and concepts that is significantly  distinct from (and arguably much more refined than) Aquinas's corresponding  theories.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Hence, as Symington presents them, Aquinas and  Scotus spend much of their time talking past one another. Moreover, when  Symington does have the chance to find a proper forum in which Scotus and Aquinas  might clash, he balks. For instance, he never tries to adjudicate between the different conceptions of being. When the opportunity arises to challenge  the identity theory of predication, Symington merely notes that the theory  is considered to be defunct by some thinkers (i.e., Geach) on logical  grounds (p. 119).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">It is troubling that Aquinas is allowed to "win" this clash with Scotus, even though Aquinas's position has not been subjected to much serious criticism. Despite my previous concession  about the weakness of Scotus's actual arguments, Scotus is right to be  skeptical of any method which attempts to establish and justify ontological claims by appealing to linguistic or logical facts.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Symington's Aquinas and Scotus both consider  predication to be a linguistic (or equivalently, for our purposes, mental) relation  between terms (or concepts). Hence, if Symington is right, Aquinas thinks that  the categories are to be individuated and justified by examining the ways in  which one term is related to another. However, Aquinas never actually works  through the derivation of all ten categories using this method, a fact that  Symington concedes is "unfortunate" (p. 44). Later, he tells us that the derivation of the full list of categories is beyond the scope of his investigation (p. 122). This is a striking admission, given that  Aquinas's method is supposed to be a viable way of individuating all <i style="">ten</i>  categories. Are we not entitled to see how the full derivation will proceed? It does not help to learn that, in addition to the list of  ten Aristotelian categories, Aquinas's method can be used to derive a  different set of four categories (chap. 4).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Even if we stick with the categories that have  been derived (Substance, Quantity, Quality, and Relative), there is still an  issue that must be addressed. It is an issue that Scotus understood, even if  he got distracted by certain details: can facts about the relationship between words give  us any definitive insight into the structure of things? Consider three  syntactically similar sentences:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;">  </span></span></span>"Socrates is tall."</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;">  </span></span></span>"Socrates is pale."</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;&quot;;">  </span></span></span>"Socrates is blind."</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">For Aquinas, the first two predicates name items  that fall under the categories of Quantity and Quality, respectively. The  third does not. "Blind" names a lack or privation. Many philosophers, both medieval and modern, deny that lacks or privations are things, let alone  that there is a category Privation. But nothing about the nature of the terms  <i style="">qua</i> terms seems to indicate that "tall" and "pale" name instances of categories whereas "blind" does not. Syntactically, the terms function in the same way. Symington's reply is that Aquinas's method of derivation only  establishes "an exhaustive list of non-reducible modes of being" (p. 127). The method will not tell us that some specific predicate, such as "blind", fails to name a form that is actualized in a substance. It only will tell us that if "blind" named a form, that form would belong to the category of Quality.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Privations do not trouble Symington because the definitions of privations must always appeal to positive attributes, and  it is supposedly differences between the modes of predication of positive  attributes, such as "tall" and "pale", which establish the non-reducible modes of being. But rebuttals of this sort make it all the  more evident that the modes of predication are not the true principles of individuation for the categories. On Symington's picture, we must always ultimately appeal to definitions. A predicate like "tall" is distinct from a substantial predicate because the definition of tall is not  present in the definition of the subject. "Pale" is determined to not be a substantial predicate in a similar fashion. Sentences (1) and (2)  signify distinct non-substantial categories because "tall" can be a subject for another <i style="">per se</i> predication, such as "this tall thing is white", whereas "pale" cannot be the subject of a <i style="">per se</i> predication. Definitions, however, are linguistic representations of essences. Some  term is in a definition because the referent of that term is a cause of the  being of the thing referred to by the <i style="">definiendum</i>. The causal relationships between different essences determine the  differences which are represented or "expressed" by the rules that dictate what term may be predicated of another term (see p. 120 and p. 156). Hence,  the real principles of individuation of the categories are the causal  relationships that obtain between different essences. It is misleading, then, to claim that  the modes of predication are what individuate and justify the distinctions  between categories.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Interestingly, if we look back to Aquinas's  texts, it is not obvious that the categories are established by the modes of <i style="">predication</i>. For example, in his commentary on the <i style="">Physics</i>, Aquinas says the following:</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">It should be  understood that being (<i style="">ens</i>) is divided into ten predicaments (<i style="">praedicamenta</i>), not univocally (as a genus is into its species), but with respect to  distinct modes of existing (<i style="">essendi</i>). Now, the modes of existing are proportional [i.e. bear a likeness] to the modes of predicating. For when we predicate something of something else, we say  that this <i style="">is</i> that (<i style="">hoc esse illud</i>). Hence,  the ten genera of being are called the ten predicaments. (<i style="">In Phys</i>., book 3, lectio 5, n. 322)</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">What I see here is not a claim that the  categories (the "predicaments") are derived from modes of predication. Rather, we get an explanation of the reason why Aristotle calls the basic genera of  being categories. Granted, we also get the claim that the modes of predication  are comparable to the modes of existing. But this is a far cry from the  claim that one can derive the categories from the modes of predication. As Aquinas proceeds to discuss the modes of predication and the categories in the remaining portion of this excursus in the <i style="">Physics</i> commentary, it appears that the modes of existing are doing the actual  work.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In his presentation and defense of Aquinas,  Symington emphasizes the role that the modes of predication play in establishing  the categories. When he turns to Lowe's derivation of categories, he insists  that logical facts "can be examined in order to establish aspects of reality, although the correspondence between logic and reality is not perfectly isomorphic" (p. 144). Symington contrasts his stance with Lowe's. Lowe  is much more skeptical of the prospect of establishing ontological claims  by appealing to linguistic and logical facts. Even after reading this book,  I find myself leaning toward Lowe's position.</p>
