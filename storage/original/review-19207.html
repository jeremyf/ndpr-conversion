	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This  book aims to explain reasonable disagreement over questions of political morality. Disagreement is reasonable when  competent engagement with the relevant considerations is compatible with reaching different conclusions (19). Examples of reasonable disagreement  discussed include the issues of whether fairness requires the public provision of assisted living for the elderly, whether justice requires that the  highly talented be paid a lot more for contributing in the socially most useful  way or that they not receive special benefits because they cannot claim credit  for the talents they possess, and whether a democratic socialist or a democratic capitalist arrangement is the proper form of political cooperation. In  such cases, the task is to explain both the reasonableness -- that both sides  can be competent <span class="SpellE">reasoners</span> -- and the disagreement  -- that each persists in viewing the other as mistaken. McMahon argues that the  theory fulfilling this explanatory task is "moral <span class="SpellE">nominalism</span>," a  kind of constructivist theory occupying an intermediate position  between realist and non-<span class="SpellE">cognitivist</span> theories of  political morality.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Moral <span class="SpellE">nominalism</span> is <span class="SpellE">cognitivist</span> in holding that moral  judgment expresses belief, but is not realist in holding that moral truths are  the products of perspectives rather than existing independently of any  actual or hypothetical perspective. McMahon argues that realist theories have  difficulty explaining reasonable disagreement. For example, non-naturalist moral  realists might assert that humans do not have full epistemic access to the moral  truth, with the result that equally competent <span class="SpellE">reasoners</span>  on a given issue could come to different conclusions. McMahon counters that  parties to reasonable disagreements about political morality are often adamant  about the correctness of their views, whereas epistemic competence leads to a  retreat from certainty when epistemic access is doubtful (30). One could imagine realist replies to this criticism, e.g., that one party to such  disagreements may <span class="GramE">not</span> recognize that the other side is as  competent as it is (in matters of political morality, after all, each side often  has a stake in failing to come to such a recognition; furthermore, lack of  full epistemic access could result in each side's failing to recognize  adequately the force of the other side's case). McMahon does not pursue an extended critique of such competing possible explanations from moral realism.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Against naturalistic forms of  realism that identify moral properties with natural properties, McMahon argues <span class="GramE">that <span style=""> </span>do</span> not account for the <span class="SpellE">normativity</span> of moral judgment.  Advocates of this form of realism typically employ a <span class="SpellE">Humean</span>  theory according to which the <span class="SpellE">normativity</span> of a  practical reason to perform an action rests on the action's conduciveness to  satisfying a desire of the agent. However, McMahon holds that a distinction must be  made between desires whose objects the agent has genuine reason to pursue and desires the agent merely happens to experience (32). He lodges the same complaint against <span class="SpellE">noncognitivist</span> theories  that construe moral judgments as expressing or otherwise grounded in desires the agent happens to have. McMahon does not address the various ways in which  moral realists or <span class="SpellE">noncognitivists</span> might try to  explain how desires are subject to critical scrutiny in ways compatible with a <span class="SpellE">Humeanism</span> of practical reasons, e.g., through  higher-order desires that one's life take a certain shape.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This book is best read as  developing a positive alternative to the more-established and familiar theories,  rather than as engaging in a developed critique of these theories. The considerable  value of this book lies in the ways moral <span class="SpellE">nominalism</span>  is developed and applied to the explanation of reasonable disagreement.  McMahon does this with subtlety and care, often with admirable perceptiveness  about the ways in which normative reasoning and extra-normative forces on the  personal and social levels interact and mutually influence one another. The book  is not an easy read. Moral <span class="SpellE">nominalism</span> is presented  on a high level of abstraction that makes demands on the reader, and even the  examples of reasonable disagreement, though helpful, are also stated at a high level  of abstraction. Nevertheless, those who take seriously the possibility of reasonable disagreement will appreciate the theoretical resources that  McMahon has developed for understanding it. Those who deny reasonable  disagreement because they fear that its recognition will slide into a radical  subjectivism or relativism will need to deal with McMahon's argument that it does  not.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">McMahon calls his view <span class="SpellE">nominalist</span> partly because it views moral judgment  as involving (in roughly a <span class="SpellE">Goodmanian</span> spirit)  the making and remaking of moral worlds. These worlds arise from human attempts to construct normative structures for social cooperation. The view is also <span class="SpellE">nominalistic</span> because it takes the possession of a  moral concept to lie in mastery of the corresponding moral term, which in turn  is explained without invoking moral properties. McMahon presents a <span class="SpellE">Wittgensteinian</span> picture of the structure of moral  concepts, in which a learner is first presented with examples of a term's correct application and then masters its usage by going on to apply it to new  cases through picking out relevant similarities with the exemplar cases. In  doing so, the learner demonstrates proper functioning of her linguistic and  motivational capacities, including dispositions to pick out the relevant  similarities. These dispositions, in fact, <i style="">constitute</i> the relevant similarities; the similarities do not exist independently of  them.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Because they are practical,  evaluative concepts involve "target-setting." For example, in identifying something as good, we label it as worthy of some kind of response, such  as choice. Worthiness of response can be spelled out in terms of reasons to respond. In accordance with his criticism of a <span class="SpellE">Humean</span> conception of desire-based reasons, McMahon does not identify reasons  with the desires an agent happens to experience but rather with the features of  actions and circumstances that merit a response. Learning from examples of the  correct application of an evaluative concept is learning not only the  descriptive features that merit response but also learning to experience the correct response. Learning "to go on" in applying an evaluative concept is learning to take descriptive features of new cases as relevantly similar  to the features in the examples of correct application and also learning to  experience motivations that register in these new cases as relevantly similar to  the motivations experienced in the examples. A child who learns from  examples how to apply the concept of beauty will not only extrapolate to relevantly  similar descriptive features but also experience relevantly similar motivations  in the new cases, such as choosing an object with those features or  contemplating it. The descriptive and motivational aspects of relevant similarity will  mutually influence one another. When I take an object to possess the relevant descriptive features, I will tend to experience the motivations merited  by beauty, and when I experience those motivations, I will tend to take  certain descriptive features of the object as relevantly similar to the features  I learned from examples. This picture of the developing mastery of  evaluative concepts, therefore, involves the interweaving of cognitive and <span class="SpellE">conative</span> elements. It is an interesting and  plausible implication yielding a robust practicality for evaluative concepts  without sacrificing the cognitive element that allows deliberative moral  discourse and logical inference among normative judgments.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The relevant motivational  disposition in the case of judgments of political morality is a disposition to  contribute to a cooperative venture with an outcome the agent judges to be good on  balance, and to make concessions from the agent's preferred cooperative scheme so  that other potential <span class="SpellE">cooperators</span> can find participation worthwhile (51-52). People with this disposition are "reasonable," and when they agree on the fairness of a cooperative scheme, no one is motivated to make or seek further concessions.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">In mastering the concept of  fairness, individuals learn from examples of what is fair that certain features of cooperative schemes constitute reasons for their collective choice; extrapolation to new cases involves mutual influence between the  disposition to pick out relevant descriptive similarities between the exemplar cases  and the new cases and the disposition to cooperative motivation. Cooperative  motivation takes on a certain intentional direction as it engages with picking out  reasons to choose cooperative schemes with certain features. As McMahon  emphasizes, the motivation does not emerge from pure practical reason in Kantian  fashion: "Motivation must present itself, to be accepted, rejected, and  ultimately shaped by judgments whose content is provided by target-setting  concepts" (62).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">No single cooperative scheme  can be expected to emerge as <i style="">the </i>fair scheme. An individual engaged in the process of making mutual  concessions with others may regard a proposed scheme as possessing features that support  or undermine its choice-worthiness. Which schemes get serious consideration depends on the socially available normative and evaluative concepts. For example, socially available concepts within a group may include ones  that present effort as a basis for distributing benefits and burdens of a cooperative venture. Other concepts might present need as a basis for distribution (56). Participants in shared deliberation will likely  differ in how they apply these concepts to the issue at hand and in the priority  they would accord, say, to effort versus need.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Consider disagreement over  the question of whether fairness requires public provision of assisted living. Most  people addressing this question will reason by analogy. Those <span class="SpellE">favoring</span> public provision will hope to establish relevant similarity to policies  that are already seen as fairly required, such as public provision of  hospital services to the elderly. Those opposing public provision of assisted  living might hope to establish relevant similarity to policies already seen as  not required by fairness, such as household maintenance or companionship for  the elderly. Shared deliberation will focus on a set of such cases  collectively assembled. Agreement is unlikely, McMahon asserts, when the issue is  organization of political cooperation. When each member has a long history of  experience with application of the relevant concepts, it will not be feasible for  each individual to present all the examples of correct application that  influence her thinking. Individuals may simply fail to see the analogies that  others see. They will vary in their ability to express relevant personal experience,  and some of this experience will be non-conceptual and resist full  expression in speech. While unreasonable views will be winnowed out by shared  deliberation, there will remain a "zone" of reasonable disagreement, a range of reasonable views. </span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The zone is subject to change  over time and across different groups and societies, since shared deliberation  within a given community must start with a variable and contingent set of  evaluative and normative concepts, and the course of deliberation will depend on  numerous variable factors. For example, the motivational idiosyncrasies of the  people with whom a given individual is interacting can affect the pattern of concessions he finds acceptable (63). However, all zones of reasonable disagreement fall within certain broad boundaries defined by a set of  core judgments that possess universal validity, such as prohibitions on  murder and chattel slavery. Such requirements are "obviously in accord with the proper functioning" of the disposition to make concessions (123).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">McMahon holds a realist  construal of the proper functioning that underlies the correct deployment of moral  concepts. As a "real normative attribute of persons," proper<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b>functioning  involves a form of self-awareness that one is not failing to make sense in the  exercise of one's cognitive capacities. Moral realists can be expected to ask, given  that McMahon is willing to posit it as a real attribute of persons, why he  does not instead or in addition posit real moral properties. His answer is likely  that such a move would not provide enough space for reasonable disagreements,  and this leads back to the need to pursue and evaluate what explanations  might be available for the moral realist, or alternatively whether the moral  realist is best off denying the phenomenon of reasonable disagreement.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">On the other hand, those who  are <span class="SpellE">skeptical</span> about real normative  properties could ask what work a realistic construal of proper functioning does, especially if  McMahon denies that a single correct outcome of shared deliberation can be  expected. Criteria of consistency and coherence apply without need for a realistic construal of proper functioning. And once one specifies that political  morality <span class="GramE">concerns</span> the disposition to make concessions  so that other potential <span class="SpellE">cooperators</span> can find  participation worthwhile, one seems able to make a case for prohibitions against  murder and chattel slavery without having to give a realistic construal of proper functioning.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The one job that a realistic  construal might do for McMahon is a job that McMahon apparently does not want  done. On a realistic construal, someone who wholly lacks the cooperative  disposition is not as he ought to be. By McMahon's association of 'ought' statements  with the assertion of reasons to do what one ought, it would seem that person has  a reason to cooperate. This line of reasoning comports with McMahon's  criticism of <span class="SpellE">Humean</span> instrumental reasoning as tying  reasons to an agent's desires in a way it ought not to. However, McMahon rather surprisingly asserts that a person who wholly lacks the cooperative  disposition lacks a reason to be fair (64). He expresses doubt that a sociopath who  lacks the cooperative disposition could learn what reasons of fairness are,  and this makes sense given his claim that experiencing relevant dispositions to  respond plays a crucial role in a person's mastering evaluative concepts.  However, a person's failing to grasp a set of reasons does not entail that he does  not have those reasons.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">There is much else in  McMahon's book from which the reader can profit: judicious discussions of whether  Western liberal democracies are required everywhere in the contemporary world,  whether the dominance of capitalism may narrow the range of political moralities  about which there can be reasonable disagreement, how zones of reasonable disagreements change over time, such that acceptance of forms of  political hierarchy that are alien to modern Western sensibilities might not have  been unreasonable in the past, and whether it was reasonable for colonizing  European powers to have suppressed indigenous forms of spirituality. This book is  highly recommended as a fresh perspective on central questions in <span class="SpellE">metaethics</span> and political morality.</span></p>    <div style="">

See David B. Wong, <i style="">Natural Moralities: A <span class="SpellE">Defense</span> of Pluralistic Relativism</i> (New York:  Oxford UP, 2006). Though McMahon contrasts his theory with relativism, this author  has a more expansive conception of relativism. This author therefore writes  from a point of view that is fundamentally sympathetic to McMahon's theory,  though some challenges will here be raised for his theory.</span></p>  </div>  </div>
