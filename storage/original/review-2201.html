	<p class="MsoBodyText">Nathan Oaklander has for years been a central player in the debate between so-called A-theorists and B-theorists about time.<span style="">  </span>This a collection of his essays on that topic going back to the early eighties.<span style="">  </span>It's an excellent collection, full of interesting and subtle arguments, a must read for anyone interested in the state of the art in contemporary philosophy of time.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The collection has four major parts.<span style="">  </span>The first part comprises three essays in which Oaklander explains the debate between the A-theorists and the B-theorists and argues that McTaggart's paradox makes trouble for A-theorists.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The second part consists of eleven essays in which Oaklander mounts a sustained attack against three major versions of the A-theory: presentism, the view that only present things exist; the so-called "growing block" view, on which there are past and present things but no future things; and the hybrid A/B view, on which spatiotemporal reality (a) comprises past, present and future entities related to one another by the primitive, B-theoretic temporal relations <i>earlier/later than</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>simultaneous with</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and (b) undergoes A-theoretic temporal becoming as its constituent parts are successively characterized by the primitive, A-theoretic properties </span><i>being past</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>being future</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The third part comprises eleven essays in which Oaklander defends the B-theory against the objections that (a) it cannot account for our experience of temporal becoming and the difference in our attitudes toward past, present and future, and (b) an adequate semantical treatment of tensed language requires an A-theoretic ontology.<span style="">  </span>He proposes that B-theorists can give a perfectly adequate account of our experience of time and our differing attitudes toward past, present and future, and that the so-called new B-theory of language can be defended against objections recently put against it by <i>inter alia </i><span style="font-style: normal;">Quentin Smith and William Lane Craig.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The fourth and final part comprises five essays in which Oaklander treats the connection between the A-theory/B-theory debate and other topics in philosophy, including personal identity, moral responsibility, divine foreknowledge and freedom.<span style="">  </span>It concludes with a nice defense of the B-theory against the oft-made (and, I think, misguided) charge that a B-theoretic ontology is incompatible with the existence of human freedom.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">A central theme running through these essays is that McTaggart's paradox renders the various A-theoretic views of time untenable.<span style="">  </span>A few comments about that.<span style="">  </span>McTaggart's celebrated paradox presents the observer of contemporary philosophy of time with a puzzling state of affairs.<span style="">  </span>On the one hand, you've able philosophers -- <i>inter alia </i><span style="font-style: normal;">Oaklander and Mellor --claiming that McTaggart has shown irrefragably that A-theoretic views of time are incoherent; on the other, you've able philosophers -- </span><i>inter alia </i><span style="font-style: normal;">Broad, Prior, Chisholm, and more recently, Sider, himself no friend of the A-theory -- who think of McTaggart's argument as manifestly bad, a "howler" even.<span style="">  </span>Strange.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">So why does Oaklander think that McTaggart's paradox makes trouble for A-theoretic views of time?<span style="">  </span>Well, you get a slightly different answer depending on the version of the A-theory at issue, but the same basic themes recur.<span style="">  </span>So that we can get a feel for those themes, let me get a version of presentism on the table, one closely connected to a version defended by William Lane Craig and critiqued by Oaklander in Essays 6, 7 and 8 of the volume.<span style="">  </span>Then I'll say something about why Oaklander thinks it runs afoul of McTaggart.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Presentism, roughly, is the view that everything is present.<span style="">  </span>Less roughly, it's the view that, it's always the case that, quantifying unrestrictedly, nothing is at any temporal distance from anything.<span style="">  </span>(I leave undefined the notion of temporal distance in play here, though the intuitive idea should be clear enough.<span style="">  </span>If our most inclusive domain of quantification includes past as well as present entities, it presumably includes Lincoln's assassination.<span style="">  </span>Suppose so.<span style="">  </span>Then the temporal distance between his assassination and the present is a bit less than 140 years.)</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">So presentism: nothing is at any temporal distance from anything; it always has and always will be this way.<span style="">  </span>But, one wonders, what is meant by 'always' here?<span style="">  </span>We could give the standard answer in terms of the tense operators of orthodox tense logics like Prior's, but then we'd be left with the question of what the presentist means by the tense operators.<span style="">  </span>Oaklander, rightly in my view, complains that there is something deeply unsatisfying about versions of presentism that invoke primitive tense operators and then say nothing about the ontology that underlies them.<span style="">  </span>So, he wants to know, what is the ground or truthmaker for statements of the form '<i>WAS</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(</span><i>S</i><span style="font-style: normal;">)'?<span style="">  </span>What is the bit of reality that makes it true, say, that </span><i>WAS</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(dinosaurs exist)?<span style="">  </span>I agree with Oaklander that these questions need an answer; here is one way of answering them.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Let us join Prior, Chisholm, Zalta and others in thinking of a "time" as certain sort of abstract object.<span style="">  </span>A time, let us say, is any proposition that satisfies the following schema:</p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is a time =<sub>df.</sub> For some class </span><i>C</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of propositions such that </span><i>C</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is </span><i>maximal</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>consistent</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is the proposition that </span>∀<i>y</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(</span><i>y</i>∈<i>C</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span>⊃ <i>y</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is true),</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">where (i) a class <i>C</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of propositions is maximal iff, for every proposition </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, either </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> or its denial is a member of </span><i>C</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, (ii) a class </span><i>C</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of propositions is consistent iff, possibly, every member of </span><i>C</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is true, and (iii) all verbs in the schema are tenseless.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">We can use these abstract times to give a presentist friendly account of the tense operators.<span style="">  </span>Here's a bare bones sketch.<span style="">  </span>Just as modal metaphysicians take there to be a <i>logical</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> accessibility relation connecting possible worlds, we might suppose there is a </span><i>temporal </i><span style="font-style: normal;">accessibility relation connecting certain of the abstract times -- a primitive, unanalyzable relation on abstract times that is transitive, irreflexive and asymmetrical and orders the times (better: some of the times) into an "ersatz" B-series representing the history of the world.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Three comments about this ersatz B-series.<span style="">  </span>First.<span style="">  </span>It's abstract: it's members are abstract times at no spatial or temporal distance from anything.<span style="">  </span>Second.<span style="">  </span>One and only one time in the series is true: the "present" time.<span style="">  </span>Times that are "later than" the present time (i.e., accessible from it) represent how things will be; times that are "earlier than" the present time (i.e. such that the present time is accessible from them) represent how things were.<span style="">  </span>Third.<span style="">  </span>It's a brute fact that times are connected up in the way they are by the temporal accessibility relation.<span style="">  </span>Pick two times <i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> and </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> in the ersatz B-series and there's this question: why does </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> bear the </span><i>is temporally accessible from </i><span style="font-style: normal;">relation to </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub>?<span style="">  </span>On the view presently under consideration, the answer is: it just does.<span style="">  </span>(Just as, for many B-theorists, the answer to the question why concrete time </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> bears the B-theorists' version of the </span><i>earlier than</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> relation to concrete time </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> is: it just does.)<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Thus armed, we can give a presentist friendly account of the tense operators, as follows.<span style="">  </span>'<i>WAS</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">)' and '</span><i>WILL</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">)', we can suppose, are predicates, expressions that combine with a singular term </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to yield a sentence that expresses a proposition about the referent of </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Both predicates, we can suppose, express properties.<span style="">  </span>The property </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, we can say, is just the property </span><i>being true</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> -- the property a proposition has iff it is true.<span style="">  </span>'</span><i>WAS</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">)', then, expresses the property </span><i>being past</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, the property a proposition has iff<sub>df.</sub> it is true </span><i>at </i><span style="font-style: normal;">a time earlier than whatever time happens to be the present time -- i.e., iff it is </span><i>entailed </i><span style="font-style: normal;">by a time in the ersatz B-series earlier than the present time.<span style="">  </span></span><i>Mutatis mutandis </i><span style="font-style: normal;">with '</span><i>WILL</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">)'.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">We can also say something about how the presentist will understand talk of presentness "moving" along the series of times.<span style="">  </span>(What I'll say, though, is very nearly vacuous.<span style="">  </span>Such, I think, is the nature of temporal becoming: it admits of no very informative explanation.)<span style=""> </span>Say henceforth that the expression got by enclosing a sentence S in square brackets is an abbreviation for the expression consisting of ‘the proposition that’ followed by S.  So, e.g., ‘[John is tall]’ abbreviates ‘the proposition that John is tall’.  Say too that, henceforth, underlined verbs and copulae are tenseless. <span style="font-style: normal;">(A quick note about this.<span style="">  </span>As I'm thinking of things, a tenseless predication of the form '</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> <u>is</u> </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">' predicates </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">-ness of </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, but indicates nothing about </span><i>when</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> has </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">-ness.<span style="">  </span>This as opposed to '</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is (present tense) </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">', and '</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is now </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">', which, arguably, indicate relative to a context of utterance </span><i>C</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> has </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">-ness at the time of utterance in </span><i>C</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Note well that to say of a predication that it's tenseless is not to say that it is always true if true or always false if false.<span style="">  </span>Presentists who think there are such things as tenseless predications will think of them as changing their truth values over time: e.g., [Bush <u>is</u> president] was false, is now true, and will be false again.)<span style="">  </span>Then on the version of presentism under consideration, to say that presentness moves along the ersatz B-series is to say something like this: </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">(*) The B-series <u>is</u> such that (i) one and only one of its members <i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>α</sub> <u>has</u> the property </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, (ii) for every time </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> in the series such that </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> <u>is</u> earlier than </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>α</sub>, </span><i>WAS</i><span style="font-style: normal;">[</span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> <u>has</u> </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;">], and (iii) for every time </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> in the series such that </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> <u>is</u> later than </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>α</sub>, </span><i>WILL</i><span style="font-style: normal;">[</span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> <u>has</u> </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;">].</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">So far, then, a version of presentism, one similar in many ways to the versions critiqued by Oaklander in Essays 6, 7 and 8.<span style="">  </span>Let us look now into one of his chief complaints, that presentism runs afoul of McTaggart.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">If I'm following, his argument will go something like this.<span style="">  </span>If there is temporal becoming in the sense that the property <i>being present </i><span style="font-style: normal;">moves along the members of the ersatz B-series, then it follows that every term in the series has </span><i>each </i><span style="font-style: normal;">of the properties </span><i>being past</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>being future</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, something that, given the above characterization of these properties, is manifestly impossible.<span style="">  </span>On the other hand, if each of the terms in the series has only </span><i>one</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of the properties </span><i>being past</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>being future</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, then </span><i>being present </i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style=""> </span>does not move along the members of the B-series and there's no temporal becoming, no A-theoretic temporal passage, no tensed time.<span style="">  </span>But the latter option won't do -- presentism without A-theoretic temporal becoming is a poor thing.<span style="">  </span>So our presentist looks to be stuck with the unfortunate consequence that, on her view, every term in the ersatz B-series has </span><i>each </i><span style="font-style: normal;">of the properties </span><i>being past</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>being future</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (henceforth, "the A-properties"), a manifest impossibility.<span style="">  </span>So much the worse for our presentist.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Similar reasoning recurs again and again in Oaklander's critiques of the various versions of the A-theory.<span style="">  </span>I find it puzzling though.<span style="">  </span>First, I don't understand why we should think it follows from the claim that the property <i>being present </i><span style="font-style: normal;">moves along the members of the B-series that every term in the series has each of the A-properties.<span style="">  </span>To say that presentness "moves" along the members of the B-series is to say what is said by (*).<span style="">  </span>But I don't see any reason for thinking it follows from (*) that every time in the series has each of the A-properties.<span style="">  </span>Pick two times </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> and </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> such that </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> <u>is</u> later than </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> and suppose that </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> <u>has</u> </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and that </span><i>WILL</i><span style="font-style: normal;">[</span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> <u>has</u> </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;">].<span style="">  </span>Oaklander's argument seems to presuppose that a proposition like [</span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> <u>has</u> </span><i>being present </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>WILL</i><span style="font-style: normal;">[</span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> <u>has</u> </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;">]] is true only if the relevant </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> and </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> </span><i>both </i><span style="font-style: normal;"><u>have</u> </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>But why think that?<span style="">  </span>Imagine someone trying to argue against actualism in the same vein.<span style="">  </span>Actualists, they say, hold that one and only one world </span><i>W</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> <u>has</u> the property being actual but that for some distinct world </span><i>W</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> logically accessible from </span><i>W</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub>, </span>POSS[<i>W</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> <u>has</u> </span><i>being actual</i><span style="font-style: normal;">].<span style="">  </span>But this won't do, says our objector, because if </span><i>W</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> <u>has</u> </span><i>being actual</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span>POSS[<i>W</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> <u>has</u> </span><i>being actual</i><span style="font-style: normal;">], then, contrary to actualism, </span><i>both W</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>1</sub> and </span><i>W</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><sub>2</sub> have </span><i>being actual</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>This isn't an impressive objection to actualism.<span style="">  </span>But is it interestingly different than objecting to presentism by claiming that if (*) is true, then every abstract time has each of the A-properties?</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Second, I don't understand why we should think that if each of the terms in the ersatz B-series <u>has</u> only one of the A-properties, then <i>being present </i><span style="font-style: normal;">does not move along the members of the B-series and there is no temporal becoming, no tensed time.<span style="">  </span>Why think this?<span style="">  </span>There's temporal becoming, movement of the NOW across the members of the B-series, iff (*) is true.<span style="">  </span>But, so far as I can see, (*) is perfectly compatible with its being the case that each of the terms in the ersatz B-series <u>has</u></span><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">only one of the A-properties.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Oaklander says things that suggest maybe he's thinking that, for any <i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, if </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> <u>is</u> </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> -- where the underlined copula, remember, indicates that it is tenseless -- then it's always the case that </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> <u>is</u> </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Tenseless predications, on this view, are not the sorts of things that can change truth value over time.<span style="">  </span>Suppose they aren't.<span style="">  </span>Then if, as (*) says, one and only one time <u>has</u> </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, it will always <u>have</u> </span><i>being present</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and there's no temporal becoming.<span style="">  </span>But I can't see that there's any reason for thinking that tenseless predication behaves in this way.<span style="">  </span>Consider the tenseless predication 'Smarty Jones <u>is</u> a horse'.<span style="">  </span>It is plausibly thought of as indicating the existence of a two-term connection between Smarty and the property </span><i>being a horse</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as opposed to a three-term connection between Smarty, </span><i>being a horse</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and some time or other.<span style="">  </span>Were eternalism true and presentism false -- i.e., were reality spread out in time as well as space, comprising past, present and future entities -- 'Smarty Jones <u>is</u> a horse', I should think, would be true relative to any time of utterance: utter the sentence whenever you like, and given eternalism, its subject term designates something -- viz., Smarty -- located in the past, present or future and connected by the two-term </span><i>having </i><span style="font-style: normal;">relation to the property </span><i>being a horse</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Given presentism, though, the right thing to think about 'Smarty Jones <u>is</u> a horse', I think, is that it is true but will, when Smarty dies, go false.<span style="">  </span>At any rate, I can't see any reason why a presentist shouldn't think this way about tenseless predication.<span style="">  </span>Consequently, I can't see why we should endorse the principle expressed by the first sentence of this paragraph.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">I doubt, then, that Oaklander's version of McTaggart's paradox makes any serious trouble for the version of presentism adumbrated above.<span style="">  </span>There are various sensible complaints one could make about this version of presentism -- that it gives no informative explanation of temporal becoming, for instance -- but that it founders on McTaggart's paradox, so it seems to me, isn't one of them.<span style="">  </span>And since the above presentism is a not-too-distant cousin of the presentisms considered by Oaklander in Essays 6, 7 and 8, I'm convinced that the same goes for them.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Be that as it may, I've merely scratched the surface of Oaklander's critique of the A-theory and haven't talked at all about his defense of the B-theory.<span style="">  </span>His arguments on both fronts are complex and penetrating.</p>
