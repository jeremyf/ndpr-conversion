	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Signals are ubiquitous in nature. But what is a signal, and how could the  members of so many species end up being able to successfully send and interpret  signals -- or alternatively, what is meaning and how can it appear? These are the two questions that Brian Skyrms tackles in his most recent book, mostly  focusing on the latter. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is no complete answer yet.  However, Skyrms argues that at least elements of the correct answer now seem  within reach. Most of the book consists in a progressive exposition of tools  and conceptual ideas (borrowed from a wide palette of theories) which are likely to be  part of such an explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The paradigmatic situations that Skyrms analyzes are modeled by Lewisian  signaling games, that is, games where senders observe states of the world and can  send signals to receivers who in turn must choose an act. The theorist's goal  is then to find ways by which either a learning process or an evolutionary  one can lead to the appearance of efficient signaling systems -- systems in  which receivers choose actions that maximize their payoffs or their fitness  depending on the actual state of the world. How could signals, which may only be  more or less random sounds in the beginning, end up being well correlated both  with states of the world and with actions?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The sheer variety of cases and models that Skyrms considers asks for a  rather detailed summary. The book contains fourteen reasonably short, varied  chapters, which can be roughly divided up in thematic parts. The first chapter  lays out Skyrms' project: to understand natural meaning (that is, meaning which  'depends on associations arising from natural processes', p. 1) by using Lewis' signaling games, evolution theory, information theory, trial-and-error  learning and networks. Chapter 2 reviews evidence that every characteristic of  natural meaning to be described, or at least some rudimentary form thereof, can  already be found among animal species. Signal use is flexible; signals can be interspecific and manifest some syntactic structure. The fact that  certain signals are salient -- that they resemble what they signal -- is not a necessary property. Chapter 3 contains Skyrms' naturalistic definition  of meaning, or rather information content (to be detailed below). This in  turn allows one to measure the efficiency of a signaling system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Chapters 4-6 adopt an evolutionary point of view, from which signaling games turn  out to be structurally unstable: small variations in structure can drastically  affect their dynamics. From this point on, Skyrms studies cases of increasing complexity and decreasing degree of idealization, starting with the  elementary case of two equiprobable states of the world, two signals and two acts.  One can then fiddle with the number of states, signals or acts, as well as  considering states with unequal probabilities. Signaling systems can be evolutionary equilibria, but so can 'pooling equilibria': cases in which senders send identical signals whatever the state of the world is and receivers  choose the same act regardless of the signal. To evolutionarily justify signaling  systems, one must explain how pooling equilibria can be avoided or at least  rendered improbable. Introducing correlated encounters, or rates of mutation,  partially helps.<i style=""> </i>Skyrms then discusses cases of misinformation and deception, showing that, contrary to intuition, there  exist some equilibria in which <i style="">all</i> signals are deceptive (or 'half-truths', as Skyrms puts it): they do not inform  about the actual state of the world.<i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Chapters 7-10 bring learning theory into the mix, distinguishing between two  kinds of learning (differing about the speed with which agents settle upon a  strategy). Like evolution, learning processes can explain the stabilization of  signaling systems, but here the results are seldom analytical and mostly emerge  from simulations. Again, unequal probabilities of states and more complex  games lead to difficulties, which most of the time can be overcome by adjusting parameters. Skyrms then studies two extensions of the previous models.  First, some signaling systems can contain synonyms (several signals  corresponding to the same state) or bottlenecks (one signal for several states).  Secondly, by considering invention of new signals, he shows that reinforcement  learning can lead to the appearance of signals themselves.<i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Finally, chapters 11-14 tackle the role played by networks in signal  transmissions. After considering the interaction of signals -- giving some hints about  how logical combinations of signals can themselves become signals -- the  emphasis is put on the interaction of agents. In different cases of  teamwork-homeostasis, dialogue-signaling systems can still appear. But the more interesting  models are those in which network formations themselves evolve. A ring is the  optimal shape for a network; it can appear at the price of some sophistication  of the models. When it does not, many mechanisms lead instead to a star-shaped network.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Lewis introduced signaling games in <i style="">Convention</i> (1969) in order to justify the existence of conventions of language  without falling into circularity, that is, without presupposing previously existing conventions. Ironically, even if the use of some of his conceptual tools  has become widespread (e.g., his definition of common knowledge or  convention, as well as signaling games, of course), Lewis' goal has been rather  neglected. Skyrms gives Lewis much more than the customary lip service (ch. 11),  and although their approaches are distinct, they are also complementary to a certain extent. Skyrms aims to explain natural meaning (that is to say  meaning itself since for him 'all meaning is natural meaning', p. 1), of which conventional meaning is a subspecies. But while Lewis concentrated on a definition of conventions based on rational and epistemic conditions,  Skyrms is interested in explaining the appearance of meaning in general and systematically downplays the extent to which rationality and complex  epistemic attitudes are needed. Not only does it not matter whether conventions  are characterized in a Lewisian way, but the learning processes that lead to  them can also be attained by low-rationality agents following simple  heuristics (ch. 8). <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">This stance is by no means unfortunate and mirrors the changes that game  theory as a whole has witnessed during the past two decades, clearly shifting from  an emphasis on epistemic aspects of equilibria to a focus on evolutionary processes -- this reflects the well-known distinction between proximate  and ultimate explanations. The usual snag is that the link between those two accounts of convention is left unanalyzed. If conventions can be a  result of processes which are cognitively undemanding, why is it that they are  typically defined by complex sets of intertwined epistemic conditions? Skyrms  seems to be raising our expectations concerning this issue (see the end of ch. 7)  but does not discuss it, which can be judged as a drawback or as an asset of the  book depending on one's taste as to whether epistemic issues should be  altogether absent from evolutionary explanations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">However, it would be incorrect to imply that Skyrms is content with applying an evolutionary framework to a topic which was originally dealt with by  using analytic tools. For he also refuses to take for granted the classical  signaling games, however useful, and he ceaselessly wonders about whether any  result would be conserved if the games were enriched or if one started being interested in the evolution of the signaling games themselves. Skyrms  does certainly look the gift horse in the mouth, and one of the book's  strengths is that hardly any model is left unchallenged. A full-fledged evolutionary analysis of signaling should not only use signaling games but should  also explain how signals could appear in the first place. Again, this  attitude, which is made clear from the outset ('Signaling games themselves  evolve', p. 2), is not dissimilar to a recent trend in another part of the literature on  evolutionary theory, namely that concerning evolutionary transitions, according to  which it is not deemed sufficient to presuppose that evolutionary entities are hierarchically nested -- how such a hierarchy itself arose has to be  explained in the first place. In other words, for Skyrms it is not enough to  substitute analytical definitions for evolutionary accounts. The latter also have  to be as thorough as possible, that is, each of the elements that constitute them  has to receive its own evolutionary explanation. This is a praiseworthy  attitude.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Now for the solutions themselves. The array of mechanisms that can lead to the emergence of signaling systems turns out to be quite vast. In the case  of evolutionary processes, allowing for mutations and correlated  interactions can sometimes eliminate pooling equilibria. In the case of learning  processes, adjusting the parameters of a learning process (e.g., choosing to  consider an 'exponential response', p. 99) helps, as well as introducing signal  invention and noisy forgetting. Neural nets, imitation and networks can also be  summoned to produce efficient signaling. In some cases, no solutions are  available yet. In other words, Skyrms provides nuts and bolts that lead to partial  solutions allowing signaling to emerge, or at least to emerge most of the time,  but the general picture is lacking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Far from staying in the abstract, Skyrms practices empirically-informed  philosophy and never hesitates to base the models he discusses on multiple examples of signaling, ranging from ape eavesdropping and bird syntax to  quorum-sensing bacteria. Sure enough, there is abundant evidence about various  explanatory factors, but what the evidence does not tell us much about is how these  factors interact. As they are introduced as partial remedies which work in  specific contexts, when it comes to explaining signaling in a new situation, one  must either combine some previously obtained factors or find a new one. In  other words, little is said about how the factors can be combined or about how  many of them we should introduce. It is sometimes hard to shake the feeling  that since we are exploring many possibilities, the underlying philosophical  lesson is lacking. Bring in invention of new signals, the rate of which you can calibrate. If too many signals are created, bring in some noisy  forgetting, the degree of which can be adjusted. As mechanisms and parameters multiply,  explanatory power decreases and ad hocness looms large.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Note that this is not a criticism of the book's enterprise. If general  solutions and satisfying analytic accounts do not exist yet, we have to make do with  what is available, in this case simulations, and grope our way along. Skyrms understands this perfectly, and the book is explicitly presented as a  work in progress, clarifying the basic issues and suggesting basic models that  call on further elaboration: 'We now have a simple, tractable model [that]  invites all sorts of interesting variations.' (p. 135) Moreover, that a multitude of partial solutions exist is not specific to signaling, but rather is  testimony to the motley aspect of most evolutionary explanations today: most of  the factors which can explain a phenomenon appear to be well identified, but  the specifics about how they actually interacted or to what extent some of  them were purely contingent are not. Have analytic solutions collapsed into simulations and should we mainly look for 'recurrent patterns [to]  emerg[e]' (p. 177)? On topics plagued by high complexity, maybe there is no other  avenue for philosophy to take.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">A small digression here: one virtue according to which a philosopher can assess a  model is its robustness. The bigger the range of variation of parameters that preserve a given result, the more acceptable becomes a model that  contains many parameters; likewise when a large number of similar models provide  similar results. Skyrms makes clear that his exploration of various models,  especially in the case of learning processes, is driven by the need for a robust explanation of the emergence of signaling (e.g., p. 93). But the  emphasis put on robustness can only be a second-best strategy. For instance, Skyrms  mentions at one point favorable results obtained when a model has been calibrated  in order to fit experimental data about learning (p. 100; but he notes that different competing models equally fit the data). Surely, once this  happens there is no need to care about robustness with respect to the model's parameters. The robustness of a model is to then be understood as  correlated to the prior probability that things happened this way, or that the factors involved actually played a role. In other words, robustness supplies a  priori, revisable reasons to choose a model before empirical evidence steers us  towards a more restricted range of parameters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Apart from these evolutionary considerations, Skyrms makes several claims  pertaining to more classical philosophical issues. However, they are likely to make  some philosophers cringe, because they are both deceptively simple and  unabashedly provocative. First, his model in which all signals are half-truths is  hailed as a counterexample to Kant's claim that universal deception is impossible.  Although the model is surely interesting, its sting becomes less acute when one  realizes that half-truths are not completely deceptive and that Skyrms adopts a naturalistic definition of deception that strips it of its intentional dimension. It might also have been interesting to see how the degree of  shared interests influences how general deception can be. Secondly and more importantly, Skyrms also provides a naturalistic account of meaning as informational content that refines possible-world semantics. To  classical meaning, qualitatively defined as a proposition<b style=""> </b>(a set  of possible worlds), Skyrms adds a quantitative dimension that conveys the amount by which a signal would affect the objective probabilities of possible states, that is, the list of the quantity of information it would carry in every possible state. However, the  extremely brief remainder of the chapter that follows does not discuss the  philosophical implications of this claim, which is, disappointingly, never to be  touched upon again. Whereas there is virtue in introducing ideas and concepts with a  certain levity -- Skyrms' tone is continuously and pleasantly off-hand -- the  downside is that one sometimes wishes the meal was heartier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <span style="" lang="EN-GB">In a nutshell, the book is reader-friendly, as all basic concepts (evolution, reinforcement learning, networks, etc.) are clearly presented. Skyrms  provides the bulk of the explanations, referring to papers for most technical  details. The book partly offers a survey of existing literature, on which it adopts a  bird's eye-view, and partly presents the author's personal insights. It treads  the fine line between non-formal discussion and an exposition of the gist of  the main technical results. Overall, this is an extremely stimulating  introduction to a fast growing literature, most of which calls upon further  contributions. 'How do these results generalize? This is not so much a single question as an invitation to explore an emerging field.' (p. 19) The book is  impressively successful in demonstrating the sheer variety of links that signals have  to many philosophical themes, as well as the daring scope for future work.  One can only hope that this signal<a name="_GoBack"></a> is successfully  received.</span>
