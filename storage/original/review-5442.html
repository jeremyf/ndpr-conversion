	<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Leibniz</i><span style="font-style: normal;">:</span><i><span style="">  </span>Nature and Freedom</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is an excellent volume of original essays on the philosophy of Leibniz.<span style="">  </span>Donald Rutherford and J. A. Cover have succeeded in bringing together a strong collection of essays from leading Leibniz scholars.<span style="">  </span>The essays are unified by their addressing the work of Robert Sleigh, to whom the volume is dedicated. Sleigh's work on Leibniz's fundamental metaphysics, especially as it appears in Leibniz's middle period, and on theodician issues, are explicitly discussed in nearly all the contributions.<span style="">  </span>The essays provide an overview of the current state of Leibniz research, and advance our understanding of his philosophical system on a number of fronts.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Rutherford and Cover have written a useful introduction to the volume.<span style="">  </span>The initial sections, which describe the development of Leibniz studies in the twentieth century, and provide a lucid and concise overview of Leibniz's philosophical system, will prove invaluable to any non-specialists who happen to pick up the book.<span style="">  </span>Using the <i>Monadology </i><span style="font-style: normal;">as a point of reference, they introduce the central features of the Leibnizian system, and isolate some of the major interpretive controversies concerning it.<span style="">  </span>They also place Leibniz's views in their proper seventeenth-century context, particularly in relation to the views of Descartes, Spinoza, and Malebranche.<span style="">  </span>The introduction also includes a helpful summary of each of the articles included in the volume.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Mark Kulstad begins "The One and the Many and Kinds of Distinctness" by noting several forms of the problem of the one and the many that Leibniz engages throughout his philosophical career.<span style="">  </span>The main issue that Kulstad discusses in the paper is whether Leibniz ever embraced monism as a solution to this problem.<span style="">  </span>It is well known that Leibniz vehemently rejects monism in his mature metaphysics, but a few early texts are, in fact, suggestive of such a view.<span style="">  </span>Kulstad provides a helpful framework for the discussion by distinguishing monism (roughly the view that there is only one substance) from pantheism (roughly the view that God is all and all is God), and then articulating four versions of monism and four versions of pantheism.<span style="">  </span>He utilizes four kinds of distinctness -- numerical, mereological, "constituential," and real (in something like Descartes's technical sense) to achieve this eight-fold classification.<span style="">  </span>Kulstad's main thesis is that Leibniz endorses real distinction pantheism (the doctrine that God exists and nothing is really distinct from God) and real distinction monism (the doctrine that substance exists and there exist no <i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>y </i><span style="font-style: normal;">such that </span><i>x </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>y </i><span style="font-style: normal;">are substances and </span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is really distinct from </span><i>y</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) in a 1676 text.<span style="">  </span>In his careful reconstruction of the 1676 argument, Kulstad appeals to Descartes's account of real distinction.<span style="">  </span>This is a plausible move, for the text bears striking similarities to the famous real distinction passage of the </span><i>Meditations</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>However, it is crucial to note a fundamental difference between the Cartesian account and that found in the 1676 text.<span style="">  </span>Kulstad reads the latter text as affirming that things are really distinct only if one can be perfectly (Descartes would say "clearly and distinctly") understood without another.<span style="">  </span>And to understand one thing apart from another is to understand the requisites of one thing without understanding the requisites of the other.<span style="">  </span>It is at precisely this point that Leibniz diverges from Descartes, for Leibniz's conception of a "requisite" is "that without which a thing cannot exist."<span style="">  </span>According to Descartes, one need not conceive all the requisites of a thing in order to perceive it clearly and distinctly.<span style="">  </span>This means that two things (e.g., mind and body) can be really distinct even if they share a requisite.<span style="">  </span>As a matter of fact, all finite Cartesian substances, and even the monads of Leibniz's mature metaphysics, </span><i>do</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> have a common requisite, namely God.<span style="">  </span>We are thus led to a surprising conclusion:<span style="">  </span>according to the 1676 account of real distinction, both Descartes and the mature Leibniz are real distinction monists and pantheists!<span style="">  </span>The moral of the story is that the conditions on real distinction in the 1676 text are so hard to satisfy that it is difficult to see how any theistic philosopher could escape real distinction monism or pantheism.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Christia Mercer's, "Leibniz and Sleigh on Substantial Unity," sets out to tackle a problem set by Sleigh's treatment of the middle Leibniz.<span style="">  </span>The question comes about in this way.<span style="">  </span>Suppose (contrary to fact as Sleigh would have it) that in his middle period Leibniz thought that corporeal substance, realistically construed, could derive its substantiality from the soul.<span style="">  </span>This means that the soul must confer completeness, causal autonomy, unity, and contain a developmental law.<span style="">  </span>How can the soul meet all these requirements?<span style="">  </span>Mercer convincingly shows that the thinking of the young Leibniz carefully tracked an amalgamated<span style="">  </span>Neoplatonism.<span style="">  </span>This philosophy has the soul, an active principle, emanate its influence through the body, a passive principle, resulting in humans (for example).<span style="">  </span>Although they did not do much to articulate the details of this theory, Mercer shows that the Neoplatonists verbally (at least) made all the theoretical connections that the middle Leibniz (at least) took to be important.<span style="">  </span>One feels that Mercer must be right that an examination of these texts and issues sheds much light on the structure of Leibniz's metaphysics, even his most mature metaphysics, but her work also intensifies the problem of dating Leibniz's final idealistic rejection of realistically construed bodies.<span style="">  </span>This problem is addressed in the next two articles -- a neat example of the organic unity of the whole volume.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Samuel Levey's "Leibniz on Precise Shapes and the Corporeal World" extends his recent work to a defense of an interpretation of the middle Leibniz that makes him a realist about the corporeality of corporeal substances.<span style="">  </span>Leibniz argued that shape is unreal and this has, naturally, been taken as part of an argument that extension is ideal and that bodies must be understood idealistically.<span style="">  </span>Levey means to block this particular anti-realist argument.<span style="">  </span>His main device is to take Leibniz to be concluding that shapes are infinitely complex, instead of unreal.<span style="">  </span>So a corporeal substance is a composite of a substantial form and prime matter resulting in bodies that are real and have fractal structure.<span style="">  </span>This would commit Leibniz to real motion as well; Levey is aware of the implication and proposes to handle it by taking absolute, non-relative motions to be fully real.<span style="">  </span>This leaves us with the question, first forcefully posed by Daniel Garber, of whether Leibniz blundered into this Aristotelianism about corporeal substance only to realize his mistake in the 1700's when he completely overhauled his philosophical system.<span style="">  </span>An alternative view is that the texts of the middle years express the later, explicit idealism in a more cautious, conservative-sounding manner.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Garber's contribution, "Leibniz and Idealism," returns to this question.<span style="">  </span>In this paper he softens his controversial and highly influential claim that Leibniz was a realist about corporeal substance in the middle years.<span style="">  </span>But he does not soften it to the point of embracing the alternative proto-idealistic view.<span style="">  </span>After providing meticulous analyses of a number of key middle-years texts, he concludes that Leibniz simply does not have a firm opinion on whether idealism or one of its contraries is true.<span style="">  </span>Garber suggests that the issue of idealism is not at the forefront of his mind during this period.<span style="">  </span>Leibniz is primarily concerned with refuting the Cartesian account of body, and replacing it with his own account, according to which body is composed of corporeal substances.<span style="">  </span>The notion of corporeal substance, in turn, is not subjected to a deep enough level of analysis for Leibniz to fully address the question of idealism.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine Wilson's, "Compossibility, Expression, Accommodation," addresses the relationship among these Leibnizian notions.<span style="">  </span>Leibniz understood them as very tightly connected, but how tightly?<span style="">  </span>Sleigh, in his work on the middle Leibniz, argued that Leibniz was not entitled to claim that they mutually entail one another.<span style="">  </span>One response to Sleigh would be to display the equivalence Leibniz saw at the foundational level of simple substances.<span style="">  </span>For a set of simple substances to be understood by God as eligible for creation, it is trivially true that they be compossible.<span style="">  </span>But what it is to be a monad is to express its worldmates and, to some degree, God.<span style="">  </span>This in turn is naturally described by saying that each monad's perception is constrained by the perceptions of its worldmates.<span style="">  </span>And that is enough for a metaphysical accommodation.<span style="">  </span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Wilson, however, provides a richer account in which we understand Leibniz as getting expression and especially accommodation at the phenomenal level and not the most basic metaphysical level.<span style="">  </span>Her idea is that the "value added" concepts of expression and accommodation are projections of the basic level to our spatiotemporal world of bodies in motion.<span style="">  </span>Brute mathematical expression is not to be divorced from the harmonization of bodies (one of Sleigh's worries) because such "curve fitting" abstracts from all the connections to be discovered among bodies.<span style="">  </span>Wilson elegantly uses examples to drive home the point that our aesthetic or unscientific appreciation of apparent disharmony in our own best of all possible worlds is fully compatible with underlying order.<span style="">  </span>The Three Stooges on a camping trip are unable to accommodate their actions to each other and their surroundings in a thick, value-laden sense of 'accommodate.'<span style="">  </span>But all their actions are fully consistent with laws of physics so the Stooges "accommodate" each other in a more basic sense.<span style="">  </span>The thick sense of 'accommodate' is perceptually relative; in other possible worlds thick accommodation would be harder for its inhabitants to find.<span style="">  </span>This would seem to solve Sleigh's problem.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In "Leibniz on Spontaneity" Donald Rutherford provides an illuminating treatment of Leibniz's views on that subject.<span style="">  </span>The general aim of the paper is to explain how Leibniz's views on spontaneity relate to his account of freedom.<span style="">  </span>Rutherford argues that Leibniz is committed to two accounts of spontaneity, monadic and agent, which he explains in considerable detail.<span style="">  </span>All of the states of a substance are spontaneous in the former sense (roughly put, they "arise from a substance's own depths"), but only some of them are spontaneous in the latter, namely, those that are brought about by a substance's desire for some future good.<span style="">  </span>The account of agent spontaneity thus allows Leibniz to distinguish between cases in which a substance acts freely and cases in which a substance is constrained by external causes.<span style="">  </span>This does not mean, however, that monadic spontaneity is unrelated to Leibniz's account of freedom (as many commentators have supposed), for Leibniz's account of agent spontaneity presupposes the truth of monadic spontaneity.<span style="">  </span>Rutherford is thereby able to explain Leibniz's well-known assertion in the <i>Theodicy </i><span style="font-style: normal;">that spontaneity constitutes the "body and basis" of freedom.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Leibniz has traditionally been interpreted as being a compatibilist with respect to the relation between freedom and determinism.<span style="">  </span>Michael Murray challenges this standard view in "Spontaneity and Freedom in Leibniz."<span style="">  </span>He argues that Leibniz appropriates an account of moral necessity found in the writings of Spanish Jesuits according to which the spontaneous actions of a substance are morally necessary, but not metaphysically or physically necessary.<span style="">  </span>On this account, the choice of the will follows infallibly from, but is not physically determined by, a substance's desires for things apprehended as good.<span style="">  </span>This version of moral necessitarianism is taken to occupy a conceptual space between full-blown libertarianism, which Leibniz repeatedly denounces, and strict compatibilism.<span style="">  </span>Murray concedes that some of Leibniz's metaphysical principles and doctrines (e.g., the principle of sufficient reason and his account of intra-substantial causation) seem to push him in the direction of compatibilism, but he thinks that theological considerations ultimately lead Leibniz to embrace an anti-compatibilist view.<span style="">  </span>He reads Leibniz as holding that the causal determination of a substance's actions would be sufficient to deflect moral responsibility from the creature to the creator, thereby making God the author of sin.<span style="">  </span>Murray thinks that nothing less than Jesuit moral necessity will allow Leibniz to block these unacceptable conclusions. </p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In "Moral Necessity" Robert M. Adams employs a methodology different from Murray's, and he achieves very different results.<span style="">  </span>He thinks that we should not rely on the Jesuit tradition to provide the content for an interpretation of Leibnizian moral necessity, suggesting instead that an accurate interpretation can be achieved through a careful and systematic analysis of Leibniz's own writings.<span style="">  </span>Adams argues that these texts -- including several that have been taken to intimate anti-compatibilist sympathies in Leibniz -- present a straightforwardly compatibilist account of moral necessity.<span style="">  </span>In the <i>Theodicy</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, for example,</span><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">Leibniz opposes moral necessity to physical and absolute necessity.<span style="">  </span>This opposition does not constitute a rejection of the determination of choice </span><i>tout court</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (as Murray supposes), but only the rejection of a </span><i>value free </i><span style="font-style: normal;">mechanism for determining choice.<span style="">  </span>Morally necessary choices are just as determined as the motions of bodies; the difference between these two cases is that only the former are determined by the value or apparent value of an end.<span style="">  </span>On Adams' interpretation, this value/apparent value is strictly sufficient to determine a substance's action -- a conclusion that draws support from the requirements of preestablished harmony, and Leibniz's use of mechanical analogies to explain the choice of the will.<span style="">  </span>Adams concludes his paper with an insightful discussion of the relation between moral and metaphysical necessity.<span style="">  </span>This discussion, which focuses on the principle of sufficient reason, underscores his conviction that Leibniz's remarks on moral necessity do not allow for a softer reading of his determinism.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Sean Greenberg assesses Leibniz's critique of the Molinist account of freedom in "Leibniz Against Molinism."<span style="">  </span>The Molinist account can be glossed as follows:<span style="">  </span>if all of the requisites for action have been posited, and a person is still able to act or to not act, then a person is free.<span style="">  </span>This conception of freedom, which emphasizes the indifference of the will, was criticized by Leibniz throughout his philosophical career.<span style="">  </span>Many of Leibniz's criticisms focus on the claim that Molinist freedom is incompatible with the principle of sufficient reason.<span style="">  </span>Greenberg challenges the verdict of several recent commentators who have taken this sort of criticism to be quite powerful, arguing instead that Molinists, such as Suarez, have the resources to rebut this charge.<span style="">  </span>But he thinks that Leibniz has a deeper and more powerful objection that stems from his theory of the mind.<span style="">  </span>Molinist freedom presupposes an account of the will in which it is functionally distinct from perceptions.<span style="">  </span>The Leibnizian will, however, is <i>not </i><span style="font-style: normal;">functionally distinct from perceptions; it consists in the consciousness of appetitions (which are only conceptually distinct from perceptions).<span style="">  </span>There is thus no room in the Leibnizian mind, as it were, for the Molinist will.<span style="">  </span>Leibnizian freedom, according to Greenberg, is essentially freedom of the understanding.<span style="">     </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In the final essay of the volume, "<i>Video Meliora Probque, Deteriora Sequor</i><span style="font-style: normal;">," Jack Davidson explores Leibniz's view on the source of sin.<span style="">  </span>It is uncontroversial that Leibniz should be broadly construed as an intellectualist (one who holds that a person never willingly does wrong), but there are different versions of intellectualism.<span style="">  </span>Davidson distinguishes strong intellectualism (the view that sin only involves cognitive error) from weak intellectualism (the view that sin always involves cognitive error, but not necessarily only cognitive error), arguing that Leibniz affirmed the former in some of his earliest works (e.g., the </span><i>Confessio</i><span style="font-style: normal;">), and the latter in his philosophical maturity.<span style="">  </span>Davidson's reconstruction of Leibniz's weak intellectualist account emphasizes the essential embodiment of Leibnizian minds.<span style="">  </span>Embodied creatures have passions, and passions can occlude the intellect's perception of the good.<span style="">  </span>This allows Leibniz to explain how an agent at </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;">2 can act contrary to what she judged to be right at </span><i>t</i><span style="font-style: normal;">1 (a phenomenon that Davidson calls "synchronic akrasia").<span style="">  </span>The final sections of Davidson's paper relate Leibniz's weak intellectualism to his views on moral therapy, spiritual enlightenment, and culpability.<span style="">  </span></span></p>
