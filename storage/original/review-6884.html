	<p class="MsoBodyText">This valuable treatise is a comprehensive examination of foundational matters in the philosophy of religion.<span style="">  </span>Schellenberg makes a serious effort to define the basic ideas in this area (sensibly enough, the first challenge he takes up is that of defining <i>religion</i><span style="font-style: normal;">).<span style="">  </span>As part of this effort, he proposes definitions of four basic responses to religious claims: </span><i>religious belief</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>disbelief</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>skepticism</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and </span><i>faith</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Another aspect of Schellenberg's examination of foundational matters in philosophy of religion is his effort to formulate general principles of justification for these four basic responses to religious claims.<span style="">  </span>In this context, he distinguishes the justification of responses, propositions, and persons, as well as the justification of response-types and response-tokens.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">On the whole, the book is well argued; a number of the arguments are ingenious.<span style="">  </span>One of the main arguments is highly original.<span style="">  </span>The conclusion of this argument is that religious faith does <i>not require religious belief</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and that in its most basic form, religious faith is </span><i>incompatible with</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>religious belief</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>This conclusion conflicts with the commonly held idea that faith requires belief.<span style="">  </span>It also conflicts with the traditional doctrine that to have faith is to have a belief which is held in the absence of adequate epistemic justification for that belief.<span style="">  </span>Since many readers will find the notion that faith does not entail belief counter-intuitive, it is likely that </span><i>Prolegomena to a Philosophy of Religion</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> will generate considerable controversy and discussion.<span style="">  </span>Although it clearly falls within the mainstream of the analytical tradition, Schellenberg's book is free of logical formalities and technicalities.<span style="">  </span>The book is effectively organized, but given the considerable density of the argumentation, it is not an easy read.<span style="">   </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In chapter 1, Schellenberg investigates the basic idea of <i>religion</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (or of </span><i>the religious</i><span style="font-style: normal;">).<span style="">  </span>He argues that religion in the </span><i>personal sense</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is more basic than religion in the </span><i>institutional sense</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and so focuses on the concept of the former.<span style="">  </span>Schellenberg criticizes the claim that religion is a family resemblance concept, and hence rejects the notion that there is no single factor common to every case of religion.<span style="">  </span>He also provides a strong defense of the thesis that there are four conditions (paraphrased below) which are jointly necessary and sufficient for personal religion: (1) frequent ideas of a transmundane reality, (2) emphasis on a significant good, for oneself and others, realizable via a relation to this reality, (3) cultivation of such a relation, and (4) a tendency to ultimize the elements of the foregoing three conditions, for instance, to think that our deepest good involves our relating ourselves in the appropriate way to the aforementioned reality.<span style="">  </span>Based upon his definition of the religious, Schellenberg develops a closely related account of a person's being </span><i>religious</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> in the sense that is of special interest to </span><i>the philosophy of religion</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In chapter 2, Schellenberg examines <i>belief</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>He attempts to provide an enlightening definition of </span><i>belief that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and based on that definition, a definition of </span><i>religious belief in</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>He dismisses the proposed definition that "to believe that </span><i>p </i><span style="font-style: normal;">is to think of the state of affairs reported by </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and to take that state of affairs to obtain."<span style="">  </span>According to Schellenberg, this proposed definition is vague and, more seriously, circular.<span style="">  </span>The definition of </span><i>S</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> believes that </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> favored by Schellenberg is that "</span><i>S</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is disposed to apprehend the state of affairs reported by </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, when that state of affairs comes to mind, under the concept </span><i>reality</i><span style="font-style: normal;">."<span style="">  </span>Unfortunately, it appears that if Schellenberg's criticisms of the first proposal to define </span><i>belief that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> are cogent, then similar criticisms also apply to his proposed definition of </span><i>belief that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Schellenberg's account of propositional belief seems to entail that belief </span><i>de dicto</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is reducible to belief </span><i>de re</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, though he does not point this out explicitly.<span style="">  </span>Of course, to carry out such a reduction is not to offer an account of belief in general.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In chapter 3, Schellenberg explores religious belief and religious disbelief and proposes definitions of <i>propositional religious belief</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>affective religious belief</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>propositional religious disbelief</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and </span><i>affective religious disbelief</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In chapter 4, Schellenberg distinguishes <i>doubts</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>doubting</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>passive</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>active</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> skepticism, and identifies a variety of forms of religious skepticism, including the following three basic forms: (1) </span><i>common skepticism</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (doubt about some specific religious proposition or some limited group of religious propositions), (2) </span><i>categorical skepticism</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (doubt that an ultimate and salvific reality exists), and (3) </span><i>capacity skepticism</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (doubt that we have the capacity to discover at least some basic truths about an ultimate salvific reality).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In chapters 5 and 6, Schellenberg defends the novel and provocative thesis that propositional religious faith is incompatible with propositional religious belief.<span style="">  </span>His argument is based upon the distinction between one's <i>voluntary acts </i><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>states </i><span style="font-style: normal;">of oneself that are caused </span><i>involuntarily</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>One's voluntary acts, in the relevant sense, appear to be those of one's acts which are not performed under coercion and which are such that one has the power to </span><i>directly</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> control whether one performs them by means of one's volitions.<span style="">  </span>Schellenberg argues that while </span><i>having</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>faith that</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is a </span><i>voluntary</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>act</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>believing that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is a</span><i> state</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that is caused </span><i>involuntarily</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>From these two premises, he concludes that having</span><i> faith that p </i><span style="font-style: normal;">does not involve </span><i>believing that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Based upon this conclusion, Schellenberg argues that there are two sorts of faith, neither of which entails belief:<span style="">  </span><i>faith in</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (or </span><i>operational faith</i><span style="font-style: normal;">), and </span><i>faith that</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (or </span><i>propositional faith</i><span style="font-style: normal;">).<span style="">  </span>Below, I paraphrase, and then discuss, Schellenberg's proposed definitions of these two sorts of faith. </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i></i></p> <blockquote>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i>S has faith in x</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> =df.

whereas propositional belief cannot be acquired or lost voluntarily in this sense.<span style="">  </span>Schellenberg appeals to various pieces of intuitive data according to which it is up to the individual to determine whether he or she has </span><i>faith that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>He then claims that this body of intuitive data is best understood as entailing that one can </span><i>directly control</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> whether one has </span><i>faith that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by means of one's volitions.<span style="">  </span>But I am not persuaded that the data in question is best understood in this way.<span style="">  </span>It is not apparent that</span><i> faith that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> requires anything more than one's being able to </span><i>voluntarily</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> exert </span><i>indirect control</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> over whether one has </span><i>faith that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>And this is compatible with the assumption that </span><i>faith that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> entails </span><i>belief that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and hence that </span><i>faith that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> cannot be </span><i>directly</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> controlled by means of one's volitions.<span style="">  </span>For example, as Pascal famously argued, one can voluntarily self-induce </span><i>faith that God exists</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by adopting a policy of conformity to religious customs and practices.<span style="">  </span>Similarly, it seems that one can voluntarily self-induce </span><i>faith that God exists</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by adopting a policy of assenting to the proposition</span><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">that God exists (in Schellenberg's sense of </span><i>assenting to a proposition</i><span style="font-style: normal;">), or a policy of representing the world to oneself as including the state of affairs that God exists (in Schellenberg's sense of </span><i>representing the world to oneself as including a state of affairs</i><span style="font-style: normal;">).<span style="">  </span>Thus, it appears that even if the traditional understanding of propositional religious faith as entailing propositional religious belief is correct, a variety of methods can be voluntarily employed by faith-seekers as an </span><i>indirect</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>means</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of acquiring </span><i>faith that God exists</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">   </span>For these reasons, I find myself unpersuaded that </span><i>faith that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is incompatible with </span><i>belief that p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Still, even if Schellenberg's account of propositional faith turns out to be mistaken, it seems that, at least, it provides a significant addition to our understanding of the psychology of voluntarily self-induced propositional religious faith.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In chapter 7, Schellenberg attempts to answer the question "What are the most general aims of philosophy of religion?"<span style="">  </span>The answer that is usually given is that these aims concern the meaning and justification of religious claims.<span style="">  </span>After critically assessing this standard answer, Schellenberg presents his answer to the question.<span style="">  </span>Schellenberg sums up that answer in the following [lengthy] statement on p. 191. </p>   <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"></p><blockquote>The aims of philosophy of religion should be to bring to bear methods and results from the rest of philosophy in (1) a comprehensive study of prolegomenous issues, including the questions of what religion, the various (actual and possible) religious propositions or claims, and the various responses to religious claims, as well as the proper evaluation of the latter and of those who embrace them, most fundamentally amount to; and in (2) an inquiry geared to determining whether any religious claims are justified, and also which responses to religious claims are justified, and to what extent persons who instantiate such responses -- in particular, religious responses -- are justified in doing so (these I have called the lower-level aims, whose realization is facilitated by work on prolegomena); and all of this not just for its own sake but in order to facilitate (3) an investigation of what bearing religious claims may have on theoretical problems in other areas of philosophy and (4) a rational evaluation of religious practice (these last are two higher-level aims).</blockquote>
<p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In chapter 8, Schellenberg defends what he takes to be the most general principles for evaluating the justification of responses to religious claims. <span style=""> </span>Here Schellenberg is concerned with the justification of response-types rather than response-tokens, for example, with the justification of belief-types rather than belief-tokens.<span style="">  </span>He discusses the dispute between <i>justificational monism</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, the view that </span><i>epistemic </i><span style="font-style: normal;">principles pertaining to truth-conduciveness are the only relevant ones, and </span><i>justificational pluralism</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, the view that </span><i>practical</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> evaluative principles pertaining to goods other than truth-conduciveness are also relevant.<span style="">  </span>Schellenberg finds it difficult to decide between the two views.<span style="">  </span>On p. 210, after what I would describe as a very detailed and powerful critique of justificational pluralism, he states that he is inclined to think that </span><i>justificational monism is correct</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, while on p. 217, he suggests that in the final analysis </span><i>justificational pluralism is correct</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>The appearance of inconsistency is unfortunate.<span style="">  </span>In any event, Schellenberg's final position seems to be that while justificational pluralism is </span><i>correct in principl</i><span style="font-style: normal;">e, it is </span><i>unlikely</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that goods other than truth-conduciveness will ever </span><i>actually</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> trump truth-conduciveness, at least within the context of evaluating the justification of response-types.</span></p>
