	 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Cosmopolitans encourage us to consider ourselves as citizens of the world and to take this allegiance to the world community as relevant in our moral deliberations. Cosmopolitanism is often thought of as a demanding view with strong responsibilities to bring about change on a global scale. In his latest book, <i>Cosmopolitanism: A Philosophy for Global Ethics</i></span><span lang="EN-AU">, Stan van Hooft provides a masterfully accessible survey of various cosmopolitan positions, explaining the values, rights, and responsibilities that follow from the position in developing his own account of what cosmopolitanism entails. According to van Hooft, the "genuine outlook of ethical cosmopolitanism" (19) is characterized by no less than 21 particular features: <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(1) measured endorsement of patriotism;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(2) opposition to nationalism and chauvinism;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(3) willingness to suspend narrow national interests in order to tackle global problems such as those of environmental degradation or global justice;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(4) respect for human rights as universally normative;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(5) acknowledging the moral equality of all peoples and individuals;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(6) respect for the peoples of the world as united by reason, sociability and a common humanity;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(7) belief in a globally acceptable concept of human dignity;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(8) benevolence to all others irrespective of race, caste, nationality, religion, ethnicity or location;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(9) willingness to come to the aid of those suffering from natural or man-made disasters, including extreme poverty;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(10) commitment to justice in the distribution of natural resources and wealth on a global scale;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(11) global solidarity with struggles for human rights and social justice;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(12) commitment to the liberalization of immigration and refugee policies;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(13) acknowledging the sovereignty of nation-states while insisting on limitations to that sovereignty in order to secure human rights and global justice;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(14) quest for lasting world peace;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(15) respect for the right to self-determination of peoples;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(16) preparedness to prosecute crimes against humanity internationally;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(17) acknowledging the rule of international law;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(18) commitment to open and participatory political processes globally;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(19) religious and cultural tolerance and an acceptance of global pluralism;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(20) dialogue and communication across cultural and national boundaries;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">(21) seeing the world as a single polity and community. (19-20)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Van Hooft offers justification for these claims in the five chapters of the book. In chapter 1, he defends the first three. By discussing a number of well-known debates between cosmopolitans and critics more committed to patriotism or nationalism, he argues for the idea that one needs to be a patriot to be a cosmopolitan, as one must operate within one's polity and therefore have some commitment to it. While he offers a measured endorsement of patriotism, he rejects nationalism on the grounds that it tends too easily towards obnoxious consequences such as "chauvinism, militarism, and the prioritizing of one's national interests over global responsibilities" (54). But here van Hooft's position does not seem to do justice to some of the more sophisticated contemporary defenses of nationalist positions (such as those of Yael Tamir and David Miller).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> As recent defenders have argued, there are forms of attachment to nations that are not necessarily obnoxious. A key issue is how non-nationals are treated, and there is no necessary connection between love of nation and ill-treatment of non-nationals. Indeed, some have argued for forms of "rooted cosmopolitanism" that show commitment to both is entirely possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Claims (4)-(7) are defended in Chapter 2, with the key focus being defending respect for human rights as a core feature of the cosmopolitan's positive commitments. Van Hooft points out that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which was endorsed by the UN in 1948, expresses an important international consensus on member states' aspirations concerning individuals' social and political entitlements. The concept of human rights has been given a certain universal legitimacy through the fact that all member states of the UN have signed up to the UDHR, which "enables fruitful discourse on human rights and global justice in all parts of the world" (63). Van Hooft also provides a more philosophical justification for human rights. Here he reflects on basic elements of human life. Drawing on work of mine in which I argue that a central feature we share as human beings is that we are agents of a certain kind, van Hooft attempts to develop the argument by pointing to subjectivity as a feature of human existence that is yet more basic.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup> This entails that human beings require those conditions that allow voluntary action and also those that allow reflection on our existence. Indeed, our subjectivity renders any social conditions that prevent us from reflecting on our circumstances and seeking to improve them on the basis of such reflection unjustifiable. It is in this capacity for reflection and change that "our dignity as human beings consists" (69). The conditions required for subjectivity give rise to our basic human needs, and basic human rights stem from these needs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Chapter 3 on Global Justice defends claims (8)-(12). As in other chapters, van Hooft tries to cover considerable ground in this, perhaps too much given recent debates on especially claims (10) and (12). I note that the defense of claim 12 is particularly concise (pp. 106-109) and therefore not completely convincing as its stands. Indeed, some cosmopolitans have argued for rethinking the wisdom of liberalizing immigration policies on cosmopolitan grounds, especially if we take the well-being of those left in source countries seriously.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup> Having read the chapter eagerly awaiting a clear statement of the content of (10), or an argument concerning it, it is not clear exactly what commitment to justice in the distribution of natural resources and wealth on a global scale amounts to from the van Hooftian perspective. I suspect it would be "sufficientarian" given the arguments of chapter 2 and perhaps linked to adequate resourcing for human rights, but this could certainly be clarified. The chapter focuses rather too much on the morality of rescue (especially Peter Singer's arguments) and the framework of justice versus the ethic of caring. However, some of that focus seems a bit dated now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Chapter 4 on "Lasting Peace" deals with claims (13)-(16). In defense of these ideas he considers issues such as sovereignty, world government, and humanitarian intervention. Drawing on the work of Henry Shue, he argues that gross violations of human rights are better dealt with through appropriate police action to rescue victims and prosecute<b><i> </i></b></span><span lang="EN-AU">rights-violators than through recourse to military action.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup> Police power can be a legitimate tool that cosmopolitans can rightfully use to protect human rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Chapter 5, "Towards a global community", tackles the remaining claims. Here van Hooft argues that a global community already exists in a rudimentary form, but it can be further refined to realize better cosmopolitan aspirations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Overall, the book is a good introduction to a rich field, with an enormous and increasing literature. As the catalog of claims above makes clear, there is much ground covered and this reasonably concise book will greatly assist those unfamiliar with key views in the debate. It would be ideal for adoption in courses both at undergraduate and graduate levels, but scholars unfamiliar with the field will also find this a useful guide. The chief strengths of the book are its accessibility and breadth, though van Hooft also offers important contributions to the literature at a number of points, perhaps especially in chapter 2.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">However, there is still work to be done on those central arguments in chapter 2 before they can ground the normative claims van Hooft believes follow from our human nature. Some of the trouble appears when he tries to derive some normative claims from some descriptive ones. This is his basic strategy:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">1.<span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal;  line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">     </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">Human nature is defined by what gives dignity and worth to human life “by fulfilling that nature” (79).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">2.<span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal;  line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">     </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">The description of human nature is, according to van Hooft, already a normative one.<span style="">  </span>[He thereby aims to have circumvented the so-called “naturalistic fallacy”.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">Therefore,<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">3.<span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal;  line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">     </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">All people should have what is needed to exercise their human capabilities, specified in (1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">4.<span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal;  line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">     </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">People need resources to exercise those capabilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">Therefore,<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">5.<span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal;  line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">     </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">Institutions and individuals should not prevent the exercise of the relevant capabilities and moreover should provide “whatever assistance or resources are needed for such exercise” (79).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">6.<span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal;  line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">     </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">Obligations and rights are symmetrical.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">7.<span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal;  line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">     </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;&quot;;">From 5 and 6, he concludes that all human beings have a right to have their needs met (though it is a further question how we allocate obligations with respect to those rights).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">If human nature described in premise 1 is already a normative account, then it might escape the so-called naturalistic fallacy, but perhaps at the expense of being highly contestable. After all the history of philosophy is replete with philosophers arguing for different accounts (both descriptive and prescriptive) of our human nature or what gives dignity and worth to human life. The staunch libertarian, for instance, might say (and indeed has said) that what gives dignity and worth to human life is independence and self-sufficiency; therefore what is most consistent with such a view is an account whereby the only rights that are justified are (so-called "negative") rights to non-interference. While I do not find such libertarian arguments at all convincing, they are unfortunately quite popular, so van Hooft may need to do more to convince such opponents of the plausibility of his preferred normative account of human nature, and the entitlements that follow from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <div style="">
