	<p class="MsoBodyText">"Not the truth which someone possesses or believes he possesses, but the honest effort he has made to get at the truth, constitutes a human being's worth. For it is not through the possession of truth, but through its pursuit, that his powers are enlarged, and it is in this alone that his ever growing perfection lies. Possession makes us inactive, lazy and proud." (98).</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">There is something peculiar about Lessing's (1729-1781) philosophical works. The reader is not likely to find in these texts any systematic exposition of a difficult issue. Yet, the more one reads the text the more one gets the impression that something interesting <i>philosophically</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is being done here. It is not difficult to trace the philosophical and literary tradition to which these writings belong; Montaigne, Bayle, and (under some interpretations) Kierkegaard are three names that come easily to mind. The skeptical sympathies of these philosophers seem to have a close connection to their ability to write polyphonic texts and </span><i>real</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> dialogues (rather than Socratic preaching to the surrounding straw men). For the skeptic, the success in creating a philosophical polyphony (i.e., a text in which several competing positions are presented in their force) may usefully lead to the desired conclusion of suspension of judgment. Yet neither Lessing nor the other aforementioned figures were in any sense pyrrhonic skeptics.<span style="">  </span>In their case (or perhaps cases) skepticism has much more to do with the politics of tolerance than with any metaphysical conviction.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The non-systematic nature of Lessing's philosophical works may provide a partial explanation for the sparse interest paid to him in the Anglo-American philosophical world. Indeed, as of today the standard English study of Lessing's philosophy is still Henry Allison's remarkable, yet forty-year-old, book: <i>Lessing and the Enlightenment</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1966). Obviously, the availability of high-quality translations is also necessary for a development of wide and serious engagement with Lessing's philosophical writing, and in this respect Cambridge's "Green" series -- the </span><i>Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, in which the current volume appears -- continues the highly important task of widening the scope of historical texts that are taught and discussed in Anglo-American philosophy programs.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The translator and editor, H.B. Nisbet, has produced some of the best translations of German philosophical texts into English.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="">1</span></span></span></a></sup> The present edition follows the same high standards. The fine translation is accompanied by an editorial introduction and notes that are very helpful in clarifying the various contexts of the essays.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The essays collected in the book belong mostly to two main groups. One group deals with Lessing's reception and evaluation of Spinoza and Leibniz (and of Leibniz's relation to Spinoza), while the other focuses on the controversy that ensued following Lessing's publication of Reimarus' boldly anti-Christian <i>Fragments</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. To the first group belong the early short pieces, "The Christianity of Reason" (c. 1753), "On the reality of things outside God" (1763), "Spinoza only put Leibniz on the track of pre-established harmony" (1763), the essay "Leibniz on eternal punishment" (1773), and Jacobi's report on his conversation with Lessing in August 1780, shortly before Lessing's death. A careful reader of the early texts will easily find in them a deep sympathy with Spinoza's philosophy which appears to go as far as endorsing Spinoza's pantheism (see Lessing's denial of "the reality of things outside God", pp.<span style="">  </span>30-1), but it is the latter text -- the conversation with Jacobi -- that initiated one of the major events in the history of modern philosophy: the </span><i>Pantheisumusstreit</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">As we shall soon see, by 1780 Lessing could hardly be suspected of orthodoxy. Yet when in 1785, four years after Lessing's death, Jacobi published the alleged transcription of their 1780 conversation which included the following lines, it became immediately clear that something of great consequence had happened.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">"Lessing: I have no more use for the orthodox concepts of the deity; they give me no satisfaction. '<i>Hei kai pan'</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> ['One and all']. I know nothing else . . .</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Jacobi: Then you would be pretty much in agreement with Spinoza.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Lessing: If I must call myself after anyone, I know of no one else" (243).</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Lessing did not stop just by revealing his own sympathy to Spinoza, but went further and suggested that he was not the only Spinozist around.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Lessing: ". . . Good. But what sort of conceptions do you have of your personal, extramundane deity? Those of Leibniz, perhaps? I fear that he was himself a Spinozist at heart.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Jacobi: Do you really mean it?</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Lessing: Do you really doubt it?" (247).</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The accusation that Leibnizians were crypto-Spinozists had loomed since the beginning of the century, and the endorsement of this view by a respected figure such as Lessing could not pass silently. The detailed story of the development of the Pantheism-controversy cannot be told here for obvious reasons,<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="">2</span></span></span></a></sup> but it will suffice here to suggest that one of the immediate results of the controversy was the rehabilitation of the philosophy of the "damned" Spinoza, a rehabilitation that played a crucial role in the formation of German Idealism a decade later.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The Jacobi-Lessing conversation dealt with some of the more general features of Spinoza's philosophy, and it seems that for Lessing the endorsement of Spinozism was primarily an endorsement of Spinoza's pantheism, and of his rejection of free will<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="">3</span></span></span></a></sup> (and perhaps also of final causation (249)). It was not an endorsement of the delicate machinery of the <i>Ethics</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, but it was still markedly a bold and significant expression of agreement with Spinoza.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Incidentally -- or perhaps not so much so -- Jacobi first revealed the content of his conversation with Lessing in a letter -- dated July 21, 1783 -- to Elise Reimarus, the daughter of Herman Samuel Reimarus.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="">4</span></span></span></a></sup> The latter was the unmentioned author of the <i>Wolffenbüttler Fragmente</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, whose publication by Lessing enraged the German Protestant establishment (and which are at the center of the other group of essays in this volume). Reimarus (1694-1768) was an impressive scholar of wide interests. He was a proponent of natural religion -- which was for him constituted primarily by the beliefs in a beneficial and wise creator and the immortality of the soul -- and a bold critic of revelation and miracles. Upon his death in 1768 Reimarus left a thick manuscript -- entitled </span><i>Apology or Defense of the Rational Worshippers of God</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> [</span><i>Apologie oder Schutzschrift für die vernünftigen Verehrer Gottes</i><span style="font-style: normal;">] -- which circulated among his friends. The treatise argued that the bible is a collection of lies, absurdities, and contradictory testimonies, whose aim was to promote the political ambitions of the biblical authors and the apostles. In 1770 Lessing was appointed Librarian to the Prince of Brunswick at Wolffenbüttel (a position formerly held by Leibniz). Shortly before assuming this position he got an early draft of Reimarus' </span><i>Apologie</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> from the latter's daughter, Elise. Lessing was astonished by the content of the treatise; later he would claim that the treatise's author "has mounted nothing less than a full-scale onslaught on the Christian religion" (96). It was clear that no censor would ever permit the publication of the treatise. However, when in 1772 Lessing was granted permission to publish rare manuscripts from the Wolffenbüttel library collection without submitting them first to the censor, he seized the opportunity and published a single and rather innocuous excerpt from the treatise that advocated the toleration of deists (1774). When the latter's publication passed calmly he went on, and in 1777 published five more fragments. This time, however, the content of the fragments was far more provocative. Among other things the fragments pointed out various contradictions in the story of the resurrection, and suggested that Jesus was a Jewish nationalist whose aim was the "temporal redemption of Israel" rather than "becoming a suffering spiritual savior of men."<span style="">  </span>Lessing published the texts under the title "</span><i>Wolffenbüttler Fragmente" </i><span style="font-style: normal;">pretending to find them in his library collection, while intentionally withdrawing the name of the author. Lessing accompanied the publication with editorial commentary (61-82) that made clear that although he considered the </span><i>Fragments</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to be highly important he did not endorse the views of their author. Since Lessing's editorial commentary included an explicit criticism of the religious importance of the bible -- "[I]t must also be possible for everything that the evangelists and apostles wrote to be lost once more and for the religion they taught to continue to exist" (63) -- and of the Lutheran adherence to the letter of the bible, he could hardly have expected that the publication would pass quietly.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style=""> </span>It is hard to figure out Lessing's intent in publishing the <i>Fragments</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Seemingly, Lessing, the foremost German dramatist of the day, was about to test his talent in authoring a real-life drama. Nisbet sensibly suggests that Lessing's primary aim was to provoke the 'neologists' or liberal protestant camp which Lessing viewed as "a half-baked religion, as well as half-baked philosophy, inferior both to the older Lutheran orthodoxy and to the radical deism of Reimarus, both of which at least possessed the virtue of intellectual honesty" (7). Yet, as one could expect, the characters in this plot refused to play their role, and the major and most furious response came from Johan Melchior Goeze, one of the leading figures of Lutheran orthodoxy (and a figure who was held in high respect by Lessing). Thus came about what turned out to be "the greatest controversy in German Protestantism in the eighteenth century, if not since the Reformation era" (8).</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Lessing's response to Goeze is a polemic masterpiece, and the reader is invited to consult the text itself. If I were to change anything about this fine edition it would be to include parts of Reimarus' <i>Fragments</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and of Goeze's criticism,</span><sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Garamond;"><span style="">5</span></span></span></a></sup> in the absence of which we remain somewhat in the dark regarding the controversy, especially the perspectives of the other parties to the dispute. Be that as it may, the current edition is a marvelous contribution to the corpus of English translations of modern philosophy, and I have little doubt that it will be highly appreciated by both students and scholars.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"> <o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText"> <o:p></o:p></p>
