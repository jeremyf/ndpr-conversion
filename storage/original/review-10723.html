<p>On the occasion of Isaac Levi&#39;s retirement, Erik Olsson collected twenty essays exploring Levi&#39;s philosophical ideas, in particular, ideas motivated by Levi&#39;s allegiance to pragmatism.<span>&nbsp; </span>The authors are distinguished philosophers, and their essays insightfully present and assess Levi&#39;s views.<span>&nbsp; </span>The volume begins with Olsson&#39;s introduction to the essays and concludes with Levi&#39;s replies to them.</p>  
<p>A group of essays examines Levi&#39;s brand of pragmatism, which rests on C. S. Pierce&#39;s belief-doubt model of inquiry.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to this model, beliefs are the origin of inquiry and change when doubts arise.<span>&nbsp; </span>Inquiry does not begin with Cartesian doubts that beliefs must overcome.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to Levi, a person&#39;s current beliefs do not need justification.<span>&nbsp; </span>Only a change in beliefs requires justification.<span>&nbsp; </span>This type of pragmatism is a type of epistemic conservatism.<span>&nbsp; </span>Beliefs have epistemic status in virtue of being held and are justifiably retained unless undermined by experience.</p>  
<p>Cheryl Misak presents C. S. Peirce&#39;s pragmatism.<span>&nbsp; </span>It involves accepting current beliefs as the start of inquiry and doubting them only for good reason.<span>&nbsp; </span>Experience may generate changes in belief such as expansion, contraction, and replacement.</p>  
<p>Andr&eacute; Fuhrmann presents William James&#39;s pragmatism.<span>&nbsp; </span>It distinguishes two types of truth, one relative to the current context and the other absolute.<span>&nbsp; </span>Inquiry may converge on absolute truth but uses current truth as its guide.<span>&nbsp; </span>An inquirer changes beliefs in response to experience according to her temperament for belief formation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Convergence may require that members of the community of inquirers eventually agree in temperament.<span>&nbsp; </span>Levi holds that an inquirer should seek belief and not permanent belief.</p>  
<p>Philip Kitcher elaborates pragmatism so that it encompasses public institutions of knowledge acquisition and dissemination.<span>&nbsp; </span>He adopts a functional account of belief and explores belief&#39;s role in communication.<span>&nbsp; </span>Reliability of sources facilitates transmission of beliefs, but a pragmatist may sacrifice reliability for informational value.<span>&nbsp; </span>A pragmatist has an interest in improving rather than grounding current beliefs.<span>&nbsp; </span>This interest may extend to improvement of public institutions of inquiry.<span>&nbsp; </span>Kitcher proposes advancing public and not just individual epistemic welfare.<span>&nbsp; </span>Levi&#39;s system addresses primarily an individual inquirer because public systems of inquiry are bound to generate inconsistencies.</p>  
<p>Bengt Hansson explicates the distinction between infallibility and incorrigibility.<span>&nbsp; </span>An infallible belief is maximally certain at the moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>An incorrigible belief is maximally robust and resistant to change.<span>&nbsp; </span>A pragmatist may take current beliefs as infallible while acknowledging that they are corrigible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hansson, however, thinks that an attractive alternative is to take current beliefs as sufficiently certain and to acknowledge that they are not sufficiently robust.<span>&nbsp; </span>Levi resists this suggestion.<span>&nbsp; </span>He holds that belief has no point if it is not absolute certainty.</p>  
<p>Erik Olsson in Chapter 11 argues that Levi should distinguish cognitive options and potential answers to a question.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consider a question about the color of a liquid after a chemical reaction.<span>&nbsp; </span>A potential answer is red.<span>&nbsp; </span>Other potential answers are blue and also white.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, if evidence is incomplete, a reasonable cognitive option may be belief that the color is red or blue.<span>&nbsp; </span>Levi calls that cognitive option a potential answer.<span>&nbsp; </span>He maintains that clarifying terminology prevents confusing his sense of potential answer with other senses of the term.</p>  
<p>Sven Hansson notes that a theory of rationality employs two types of idealization.<span>&nbsp; </span>One type simplifies and the other type presents goals that rational agents aspire to attain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Probabilism offers an account of the doxastic states of cognitively unlimited agents.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the behavior of ideal agents may not guide the behavior of nonideal agents.<span>&nbsp; </span>Accounts of belief change formulate goals for cognitively limited agents.</p>  
<p>Levi&#39;s pragmatism concerning belief leaves some issues unresolved.<span>&nbsp; </span>For instance, the type of justification he provides for belief change does not address the reliability of perception.<span>&nbsp; </span>He takes reliance on perception to be a matter of routine and attends mainly to deliberative methods of belief change.<span>&nbsp; </span>The view that current beliefs do not need justification also raises several questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>It leaves unexplained our attempts to gather evidence to test and support current beliefs.</p>  
<p>Another group of essays addresses Levi&#39;s account of belief change.<span>&nbsp; </span>By belief, Levi means certainty.<span>&nbsp; </span>An agent holds current beliefs to be infallible but not incorrigible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Levi&#39;s principles of belief change respect epistemic entrenchment and informational economy.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, beliefs at the core of a corpus of knowledge are the last to be abandoned when an agent confronts evidence challenging her beliefs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Levi calls his principle for removing beliefs &quot;mild contraction&quot;.</p>  
<p>Ot&aacute;vio Bueno argues that accounts of belief change gain realism and versatility by adopting a paraconsistent logic that allows for contained inconsistencies.<span>&nbsp; </span>A useful theory need not be true.<span>&nbsp; </span>An inconsistency need not be damaging to a theory that makes no claim to express the truth.</p>  
<p>Maurice Pagnucco compares two accounts of abduction.<span>&nbsp; </span>One takes abduction as identification of potential answers to an inquiry.<span>&nbsp; </span>The other takes abduction as consistent explanation of observations.<span>&nbsp; </span>Only the first is abduction in the traditional sense.<span>&nbsp; </span>The second is a form of induction.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both abduction and induction have significant roles in belief change.</p>  
<p>Hans Rott examines Levi&#39;&#39;s mild-contraction method of belief removal.<span>&nbsp; </span>It yields the same results as a method of contraction that Rott and Pagnucco introduce and call &quot;severe withdrawal&quot;.<span>&nbsp; </span>Levi&#39;s motivation for mild contraction applies decision theory to the promotion of informational value.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rott and Pagnucco&#39;s motivation for severe withdrawal relies on axiomatic principles of belief change.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rott believes that Levi does not provide enough detail about informational value to support his arguments for mild contraction and adopts too many constraints on contraction.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to Rott, severe withdrawal is just one of several sensible methods of contraction.</p>  
<p>Horacio Arl&oacute; Costa favors mild contraction because it has suitable regard for entrenched beliefs.<span>&nbsp; </span>His main project is to propose appropriate standards for sequences of changes in belief.<span>&nbsp; </span>The sequences may appear in nested conditionals or may appear in the dynamics of actual belief changes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Levi holds that the changing context of beliefs during the course of time authorizes radical changes in belief.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is therefore hard to identify interesting constraints on the dynamics of actual beliefs.</p>  
<p>Taking belief to be absolute certainty makes beliefs rare.<span>&nbsp; </span>People are absolutely certain of very few propositions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Levi holds that belief has no role if it is not absolute certainty.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, belief has a role in communication among cognitively limited agents even if it does not express absolute certainty.<span>&nbsp; </span>Taking it as absolute certainty is at best a simplifying idealization.<span>&nbsp; </span>For instance, models of inference are simpler if beliefs are certainties.</p>  
<p>A third group of essays discusses Levi&#39;s views about credal probability.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is probability resting on beliefs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Beliefs are in flux, and after each belief change, credal probabilities arise anew.<span>&nbsp; </span>Conditionalization fails because beliefs may change radically.<span>&nbsp; </span>A proposition assigned minimum probability at one time may receive maximum probability at another time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Beliefs may fail to generate determinate probabilities.<span>&nbsp; </span>When probabilities are indeterminate, a set of probability assignments representing them is convex.<span>&nbsp; </span>If two probability assignments in the set assign different probability values to a proposition, then for every probability value between those different values some assignment in the set accords that value to the proposition.</p>  
<p>Nils-Eric Sahlin distinguishes outcome risks and epistemic risks.<span>&nbsp; </span>The latter arise from ignorance about the former.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consuming genetically modified food, for instance, may involve an epistemic risk because of its unknown long term consequences.<span>&nbsp; </span>Indeterminate probabilities and utilities of possible outcomes generate epistemic risks.<span>&nbsp; </span>The precautionary principle, although vague, licenses regulations to reduce epistemic risks.</p>  
<p>Henry Kyburg argues that admissible probability assignments need not form a convex set.<span>&nbsp; </span>One may know that a coin is either biased for Tails or biased for Heads so that the admissible assignments for Heads are just 0.4 and 0.6.<span>&nbsp; </span>Convexity adds the assignment 0.5 although it is inadmissible.</p>  
<p>D. H. Mellor takes chances to be propensities, that is, dispositions that manifest themselves in relative frequencies of outcomes of endlessly repeated chance set-ups.<span>&nbsp; </span>The dispositions are place holders for their categorical non-chance bases.<span>&nbsp; </span>His account of chance grounds direct inference from knowledge of chances to degrees of belief concerning the outcomes of chance set-ups.</p>  
<p>Wolfgang Spohn uses ranking functions to elucidate the structural similarities of probability assignments and belief changes.<span>&nbsp; </span>He does not claim that these functions provide a common reductive base for probabilities and belief changes, however.<span>&nbsp; </span>Theories of probability and belief may be separate.<span>&nbsp; </span>There may be no bridge principles governing the interaction of probabilities and beliefs.<span>&nbsp; </span>As the lottery paradox shows, the relation between probabilities and beliefs is vexed.</p>  
<p>Erik Olsson in Chapter 12 analyzes the lottery paradox and draws some conclusions about knowledge from it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because knowledge has a social role, a person should not assert that he knows that his lottery ticket will not win.<span>&nbsp; </span>Other more cautious people in his epistemic position may not draw the same negative conclusion.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence he is not entitled to claim knowledge that his ticket will not win.</p>  
<p>Mark Kaplan argues that probabilities express the force of epistemic considerations, whereas attributions of knowledge blend epistemic and pragmatic considerations.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may not regard yourself as knowing that <em>P</em> if at the same time you are unwilling to act as if </span><em>P</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence in a context where the stakes are low, one may self-attribute knowledge that </span><em>P</em>, whereas in another epistemically identical context where the stakes are high, one may withdraw the attribution.<span>&nbsp; </span>Assertions of knowledge require taking account of the pragmatic circumstances of others and do not rest solely on evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>On page 230, Kaplan observes that Levi&#39;s account of belief expansion neglects all goals except cognitive goals, such as informational value, and so gives cognitive goals absolute priority over all other goals.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, using informational value to justify adding a belief, taken as a certainty, uses pragmatic rather than epistemic reasons to boost a proposition&#39;s probability.</span></p>  
<p>Wlodek Rabinowicz refines diachronic pragmatic arguments for the principles of conditionalization, reflection, and transitivity of preferences.<span>&nbsp; </span>The refinements accommodate foresight and sophisticated choice.<span>&nbsp; </span>They use persistent bookies and persistent offers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although the refinements do not settle the rationality of following the principles, they escape common objections to the pragmatic arguments for the principles.<span>&nbsp; </span>In general, the pragmatic arguments exhibit ways that people may be exploited if they make decisions in a piecemeal rather than a unified way.</p>  
<p>According to Levi, whether an agent&#39;s inquiry should culminate in accepting a hypothesis <em>h</em> depends on the expected epistemic value for the agent of believing that </span><em>h</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Suppose that </span><em>Q<sub>K</sub></em> assigns for the agent a credal probability of a hypothesis according to her current corpus of knowledge, </span><em><span>a</span></em></span> is the agent&#39;s degree of caution in belief formation, and <em>V</em><sub><span><em>a</em></span></sub></span> assigns for the agent an epistemic value with respect to <em><span>a</span></em></span> of believing a hypothesis given a truth value for it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then the following formula expresses the agent&#39;s expected epistemic value with respect to <em><span>a</span></em></span> of believing <em>h</em>.</span></p>  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><em>EV</em><sub><span><em>a</em></span></sub></span>(<em>h</em>) = </span><em>Q<sub>K</sub></em>(</span><em>h</em>) &bull; </span><em>V</em><sub><span><em>a</em></span></sub></span>(<em>h</em>, true) +<span>&nbsp; </span></span><em>Q<sub>K</sub></em>(~</span><em>h</em>) &bull; </span><em>V</em><sub><span><em>a</em></span></sub></span>(<em>h</em>, false)</span></p>  
<p>Rival hypotheses have expected epistemic values also.<span>&nbsp; </span>An agent should accept <em>h</em> only if the expected epistemic value of believing </span><em>h</em> is at least as great as the expected epistemic value of believing any rival hypothesis.</span></p>  
<p>If probabilities guide action but rest on beliefs adjusted to promote informational value, then cognitive goals are double counted.<span>&nbsp; </span>They count once in adjustments of beliefs and a second time in decisions about action.<span>&nbsp; </span>Action thus accords excessive weight to an agent&#39;s cognitive goals.<span>&nbsp; </span>An agent who follows Levi&#39;s principle of expansion may be exploited as a result.<span>&nbsp; </span>Suppose, for example, that she boosts from 0.8 to 1.0 the probability of a hypothesis because accepting the hypothesis maximizes expected epistemic value in light of the hypothesis&#39;s high informational value.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before accepting the hypothesis, she may sell for $0.80 a ticket that pays a dollar if the hypothesis is true and otherwise nothing.<span>&nbsp; </span>After accepting the hypothesis, she may buy back the ticket for $1.00.<span>&nbsp; </span>She loses $0.20 from these transactions.<span>&nbsp; </span>The selling and repurchasing indicate a preference reversal that occurs without any change in basic goals or evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>The combination of transactions is irrational.</p>  
<p>Probabilities should represent strength of evidence and should not be influenced by cognitive goals such as informational value.<span>&nbsp; </span>Letting pragmatic considerations influence beliefs that in turn influence probabilities makes probabilities unreliable guides to action.<span>&nbsp; </span>If probabilities are to guide action well, probabilities that have purely epistemic grounding should replace the credal probabilities that appear in Levi&#39;s system of pragmatically grounded belief change and probability assignments resting on updated beliefs.</p>  
<p>Letting informational value guide belief change appears to create a form of wishful thinking.<span>&nbsp; </span>One accepts a hypothesis one would like to believe because of its informational value.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pragmatically grounded beliefs may, however, serve a useful role in communication between cognitively limited agents.<span>&nbsp; </span>Assertions of belief condense prohibitively expensive communication about probabilities and utilities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, pragmatically grounded beliefs may usefully guide the acts of cognitively limited agents in circumstances where probabilistic analysis has unjustified costs.<span>&nbsp; </span>The simplification may yield some misguided acts, but may also yield on average a balanced response to epistemic and pragmatic considerations.<span>&nbsp; </span>One may acknowledge pragmatic considerations in a theory of belief formation but should not let any beliefs other than evidential beliefs control probability assignments.</p>  
<p>A last group of essays addresses psychology and dispositions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Wolfram Hinzen considers the psychology of belief change.<span>&nbsp; </span>He advocates naturalizing normative theories of belief change so that they may predict and explain behavior.</p>  
<p>Akeel Bilgrami holds that dispositions have a categorical base and are nonnormative, whereas commitments are normative because they involve agency, intentionality, and a first-person perspective.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mental health requires dispositions and commitments to be in agreement, and psychoanalysis promotes their agreement.<span>&nbsp; </span>In his reply, Levi explains his view of commitments.<span>&nbsp; </span>He holds that they are not moral commitments, may obtain even if meeting them is beyond an agent&#39;s capabilities, and are not such that an agent&#39;s failure to meet them entails the agent&#39;s acceptance of criticism.</p>  
<p>Johannes Persson compares Levi&#39;s account of dispositions with Jon Elster&#39;s account of dispositions.<span>&nbsp; </span>He finds that dispositions according to Levi are surefire and fit into laws, whereas according to Elster they are not surefire and yield mechanisms producing effects.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dispositions as Levi sees them yield etiological explanations of why events occur, whereas dispositions as Elster sees them yield constitutive explanations of how events occur.</p>  
<p>This book treats important topics in epistemology and metaphysics, and its essays uniformly reach a high level of scholarship.<span>&nbsp; </span>Theorists in philosophy, computer science, and psychology will profit from reading it thoroughly.</p>
