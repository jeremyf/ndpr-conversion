	<p class="MsoBodyText">Although Darwin has had a profound influence on philosophy, he generally is considered a biologist, not a philosopher.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless he was an active participant in philosophical discussions that are if anything even more relevant in our day than they were in his.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore it seems quite appropriate to include him, along with other philosophical scientists, such as Kant and Freud, in the <em>Routledge Philosophers</em><span style="font-style: normal"> series edited by Brian Leiter.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Tim Lewens describes his book as a &quot;philosophical introduction to Darwin.&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>He says that its ambitions are similar to those of my first book, <em>The Triumph of the Darwinian Method</em><span style="font-style: normal"> (University of California Press, 1969).<span>&nbsp; </span>It is of some interest to see how a book that was written by a young philosophical biologist at a time when the philosophy of biology was not yet a profession compares with one written by an outstanding representative of the new generation of professional philosophers of biology.<span>&nbsp; </span>The idea that Darwin was seriously interested in philosophy, and much better at it than many authors have claimed, has certainly stood the test of time.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the perspectives of a philosophical biologist and a philosopher of biology, however complementary they may be, give a somewhat different slant on the same subject matter.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lewens&#39;s professed goal is to consider what light Darwin&#39;s ideas can shed on matters of philosophical importance.<span>&nbsp; </span>We might differ somewhat with respect to the relative importance of such matters.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To avoid giving a misleading impression I should state from the outset that the book succeeds admirably in presenting Darwin and his ideas to its intended audience.</span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">In the first chapter Lewens gives his readers a general overview of Darwin&#39;s life and accomplishments.<span>&nbsp; </span>As one might expect, he draws attention to various philosophers who at least attracted his attention, beginning with James Mackintosh whom Darwin met at his uncle&#39;s home while still in his teens.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is all the more evident that Darwin was seriously concerned with epistemology, ontology, psychology, ethics and theology.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">The second chapter is on the philosophical implications of evolution and natural selection.<span>&nbsp; </span>One topic, or group of topics, that might have received more attention somewhere in the book, is the epistemology of the historical sciences.<span>&nbsp; </span>Darwin was a geologist, and a follower of Charles Lyell.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that Darwin&#39;s ability to deal with the apparent lack of evidence for evolution in the fossil record was a major intellectual accomplishment.<span>&nbsp; </span>He also was a comparative anatomist and a biogeographer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lewens not only says very little about such topics, he largely skips over the evidence for evolution both in general and for particular historical narratives.<span>&nbsp; </span>Perhaps such topics as the principles of phylogenetics are not of much interest to contemporary philosophers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Biologists on the other hand consider that aspect of their science very important, and that is one reason why systematic biology is so philosophical these days.</p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Lewens rather emphasizes the mechanistic aspect of Darwin&#39;s contribution, including the evidence for natural selection.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is good to see sexual selection treated as important, though the point that sexual selection provides evidence for selection theory in general might have been made more forcefully.<span>&nbsp; </span>In various places the exposition might have been improved by not saying that selection &quot;acts&quot; on something.<span>&nbsp; </span>Selection is not an agent, and talking about it that way can be most misleading.<span>&nbsp; </span>Perhaps this is as good a place as any to remark upon the tradition of treating philosophy as if it were just a lot of talk about talk.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am pleased to see Lewens getting away from that tradition and grappling with the more substantive ontological and epistemological issues.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Lewens says a lot about Darwin&#39;s views on purpose and design, and agrees with me that Darwin&#39;s use of the term &quot;contrivance&quot; was ironic.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, he goes along with the notions of Daniel Dennett, a philosopher who wrote a book on such matters without having understood either the biology or the philosophical problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is not a question of whether we might talk about evolution and sometimes mean the same thing irrespective of whether we invoke God or natural selection.<span>&nbsp; </span>As I pointed out in my book <em>The Economy of Nature and the Evolution of Sex</em><span style="font-style: normal"> (University of California Press, 1974), teleological thinking is undesirable because it so often leads to serious errors.<span>&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that a fallacious argument can sometimes lead to true conclusions does not mean that it never leads to false conclusions.<span>&nbsp; </span>We do not even need to ask what intentions are involved when we can get the right answer by asking the historical question of what has happened and why. </span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Lewens stumbles in his analysis of the struggle for existence.<span>&nbsp; </span><a name="OLE_LINK3"></a>He denies that modern evolutionary theory has an &quot;essential&quot; commitment to the Malthusian view.<span>&nbsp; </span>He claims to have established this by showing that when there is a surfeit of resources there is no struggle for existence.<span>&nbsp; </span>He uses the example of two kinds of wolves, slower and faster ones, with the faster wolves gaining relatively more resources than the slower ones.<span>&nbsp; </span>The race may or may not be to the swift, but a race is a struggle in the theories of Malthus and Darwin.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lewens should have read Malthus and Gause.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Chapter 3 deals with species and essences.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lewens discusses Darwin&#39;s views on species from the view of nominalism versus realism and comes up with a reasonable characterization.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would only object that treating the natural system as Darwin saw it as a hierarchical system of resemblance does insufficient justice to Darwin&#39;s ontological stance.<span>&nbsp; </span>The natural system is a hierarchy of genealogical relationships, not one of resemblances or similarities.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the risk of anticipating what is said later in this review, scholastic philosophy would say that the essence of the natural system is genealogy, whereas the resemblances are mere accidents.<span>&nbsp; </span>There follows a discussion on individuals and kinds, and especially whether species are individuals or kinds.<span>&nbsp; </span>That species are individuals, not kinds, was proposed by David Hull and me many years ago, and it would seem that all the young philosophers of biology now accept it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lewens is no exception.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was a bit puzzled by his assertion that &quot;the terms &#39;individual&#39; and &#39;kind&#39; are modern inventions&quot; (pp. 78-79), but I suppose he means simply that Darwin did not use those words as we do when discussing such matters.<span>&nbsp; </span>Darwin did say that families are individuals and in so doing he was using the term &#39;individual&#39; in a traditional philosophical sense.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lewens suggests that the polymorphism of species and other biological populations makes it hard to interpret them as kinds.<span>&nbsp; </span>There follows a discussion on population thinking versus typological thinking based on expositions of the distinction by Ernst Mayr.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that Mayr&#39;s exposition of the distinction was in many ways unfortunate, for it tended to reinforce the notion that the problem can be solved by treating populations as if they were sets.<span>&nbsp; </span>Darwin got away from typological thinking by treating species and higher taxonomic groups as historical entities.<span>&nbsp; </span>That makes them concrete particular things, i.e., ontological individuals, though as Lewens points out, Darwin&#39;s statements about such matters are not very clear.<span>&nbsp; </span>If one accepts the individuality of species, then no species has an essence, for only classes and not individuals can have essences.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore human nature, at least in the sense of an essence, is a metaphysical delusion.<span>&nbsp; </span>I come back to that point later in this review. </p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Chapter 4, on evidence, interprets Darwin&#39;s epistemology as inference to the best explanation.<span>&nbsp; </span>It includes a substantial amount of discussion on William Whewell and John Herschel, philosophers with whose works Darwin was intimately acquainted.<span>&nbsp; </span>There might have been a bit more discussion on Darwin&#39;s actual arguments for evolution, but there seems nothing objectionable in Lewens&#39;s account.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of Darwin&#39;s arguments were obviously directed against special creation, and understandably a book intended for philosophers pays a lot of attention to that.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lewens has a good bit to say about intelligent design creationism and for the intended audience it seems reasonable to include some material on that current topic.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Chapter 5, on mind, addresses the kind of topic that interests philosophers very much.<span>&nbsp; </span>We biologists have tended to leave it to psychologists, but again Lewens quotes my remark that for psychologists, &quot;The natural inclination would be merely to impose an oversimplified evolutionary rationalization upon the observations.&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>Lewens provides ample grounds for thinking that this is a serious problem these days.<span>&nbsp; </span>He discusses Darwin&#39;s major psychological work, <em>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</em><span style="font-style: normal">, and notes how little it has to do with natural selection.<span>&nbsp; </span>That leads, indirectly of course, to a discussion on what has been called the psychic unity of mankind.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such unity suggests an essence, or what is often called human nature, that has to be rationalized in the face of polymorphism.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Chapter 6, on ethics, includes some discussion on Darwin&#39;s debt to Adam Smith and other moral philosophers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Darwin seems to have been quite hesitant to embrace normative evolutionary ethics.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is a good criticism of Robert Richards&#39;s notions on such matters, which turn out to be a form of ethical intuitionism.<span>&nbsp; </span>That same author has some other odd notions about Darwin, and perhaps his reliance upon intuition explains them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Richards has attempted to portray Darwin as a <em>Naturphilosoph</em><span style="font-style: normal">, or German mystic, rather than a sensate intellect who worked in the rationalist tradition of Erasmus Darwin, Charles Lyell, and &Eacute;tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Beyond pointing out that Chapter 7 provides a good discussion on evolutionary epistemology and related topics, I pass it over to go directly to Chapter 8, which is on politics.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <em>The Descent of Man</em><span style="font-style: normal"> Darwin says much that has been taken up by political writers, left, right and center.<span>&nbsp; </span>Evolution by natural selection seems disappointing to everybody with a political axe to grind.<span>&nbsp; </span>The notion of human nature keeps creeping into discussions of such topics, and to make matters worse, what is meant by human nature is rarely made explicit.<span>&nbsp; </span>All too often it means an essence.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let us hope that philosophers who read this chapter will be stimulated to exercise their analytical and critical faculties and bring some clarity into the discussion.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText">Chapter 9, on philosophy, is something of a miscellany.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is much of interest on contingency and necessity, using the argument between Stephen Jay Gould and Simon Conway Morris as an example.<span>&nbsp; </span>There follows a consideration of Darwin&#39;s views on progress, something that Darwin did not consider necessary to the degree that Lamarck did.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think that Lewens&#39;s treatment of Darwin&#39;s views on progress in organic evolution would have been somewhat better had he viewed it as analogous to economic, technological, and scientific progress.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this connection it is amusing that Lewens attributes the rise of naturalism among philosophers to a realization that lack of progress in philosophy during the middle of the twentieth century resulted from too much concern for language and not enough for empirical enquiry.<span>&nbsp; </span>By naturalism he means &quot;a position which advocates some form of deference among philosophers to our best scientific theories.&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>Darwinian evolutionary theory is obviously one of our best scientific theories, but what makes it one of them or perhaps even the very best?<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that Darwin introduced ways of thinking that have been fruitful in exploring a wide range of phenomena.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was always asking new kinds of questions that give new kinds of answers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lewens draws attention to the breadth of Darwin&#39;s interests, and contrasts that with the narrow specialization of most scientists these days.<span>&nbsp; </span>Philosophy has taken on, he says, the work of synthesizing the results of scientific research.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let us hope that both philosophers and scientists will work together to achieve such synthesis.</p>
