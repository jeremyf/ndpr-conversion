	  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">"Philosopher" was a label that Michel Foucault sometimes resisted, especially in the earlier decades of his career, but Timothy O'Leary and Christopher Falzon have assembled an excellent  anthology of articles demonstrating Foucault's engagement with and contributions to contemporary philosophical practice throughout his life's work. The book examines and situates Foucault's work in relation to several major  strands of philosophical tradition. It consists of an introduction and one paper  each by the editors and an additional nine papers by well-known Foucault  scholars including Gary Gutting, Jana Sawicki, Amy Allen, and Paul Patton, among  others. There is no lack of interpretive disagreement in the group, which is  especially notable in Gary Gutting's explicit critique of BÃ©atrice Han-Pile's work  and Barry Allen's implicit challenge to C.G. Prado. However, the  disagreements and alternative perspectives are informative and thought-provoking.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Obviously it is impossible in one review to do  justice to all eleven articles, and O'Leary and Falzon do an excellent job of  summarizing them in their introduction. Here I will simply discuss four themes, each  of which runs through several different papers. The first is Foucault's  relation to his predecessors, including Hegel (Gutting), Nietzsche (Hans Sluga),  and Heidegger (Timothy Rayner). The second is Foucault's relationship to  and, in some cases, value for contemporary philosophical debates, including  critical theory (Falzon and Amy Allen) and queer theory (Sawicki), as well as  other discussions less easily categorized (Prado and O'Leary). Aligned with  the second theme, the third theme that emerges very strongly in this  collection is the question of truth and Foucault's epistemological positions. This  comes out to some extent in Rayner's article on Heidegger, but it is foregrounded  in Barry Allen's essay entitled "Foucault's Theory of Knowledge." Finally, I will conclude this review with a look at the theme of  political theory and practice, with a focus on Paul Patton's essay, "Foucault and Normative Political Philosophy: Liberal and Neo-Liberal Governmentality  and Public Reason."</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">O'Leary and Falzon set out a central question in  their introduction: in what sense can we say that Foucault was a philosopher?  Gutting takes an historical and contextual approach to this question with a  careful examination of what philosophy actually meant and encompassed in  Foucault's formative years. After discussion of Wahl and Hippolyte, Gutting  concludes that Foucault's possibilities as a philosopher in the 1950s would have been  defined by "the turbulent space delimited by the two unacceptable resting points of existential phenomenology and Hegelian absolute knowledge" (25). But Foucault wanted "a complete break with the past," Gutting holds (28); therefore, it makes sense that for many years he resisted the label "philosopher," despite his training and interests. For a variety of reasons, some philosophical and some political, Foucault rejected  philosophies that put the subject at the foundation of analysis and took experience  as the object of description. He undertook instead projects of  de-subjectivation, projects that create experiences as opposed to merely describing them,  projects that pull away from established identities. Foucault's work was not  philosophy in the sense that was accepted in his time, Gutting argues; he was not a builder of new theoretical structures. "His intellectual enterprise was the critique of disciplines and practices that restrict the freedom to transform ourselves," and thus "he was a philosopher in the ancient sense of someone who sought, if not to know the truth, then to live the truth" (34).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Two philosophers whom Foucault did embrace were  Nietzsche and Heidegger. In the last interview before his death, he pronounced  himself "simply a Nietzschean" (36), a declaration with which Sluga takes issue. Foucault departed from Nietzsche in at least three important  ways, Sluga argues. Foucault downplays the question of origins of morality; he sees genealogy primarily in relation to history rather than politics; and he minimizes Nietzsche's interpretive understanding of the method (38).  Sluga discusses these departures in helpful detail. In that same final  interview, Foucault also discussed his relationship with Heidegger's work, an issue  that Timothy Rayner takes up with a very informative discussion of both philosophers' attention to how subjectivity becomes the locus of truth  (62).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Turning to contemporary debates, Amy Allen  defends Foucault against the charge of the genetic fallacy and a range of other  accusations from Habermas and his followers. She argues, effectively, that in fact  Foucault has a lot to offer critical theorists, who she claims often make the  very errors they see in Foucault. Falzon takes a less direct approach but  also criticizes narrow readings that can be found in the work of some  critical theorists. His concern lies chiefly in defending Foucault against the  charge of radical individualism and in showing that Foucault's critique of  justifications as historical does not amount to the claim that justifications are  non-existent (240). Sawicki notes that very few philosophers have taken Foucault's homosexuality seriously enough to examine his works from that angle -- a mistake, on her view -- but queer theorists have made the error of  trying to ally Foucault and psychoanalysis. Sawicki argues persuasively against  the latter and urges that more attention be paid to Foucault's social and  political position as a philosophical departure point.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This volume has a surprising number of essays  that deal in one way or another with epistemology. Rayner's essay (already  mentioned) focuses on the history of truth, an issue that should command the  attention of all epistemologists but currently does not. Prado offers a reading of  Foucault that makes him compatible with the work of Donald Davidson and, in fact, furthers the project that Davidson only sketches out. Foucault, unlike Davidson, is able to account for how people acquire the ability to  understand propositions whose literal meanings are quite different from their  meanings in context. (Davidson refers in this connection to "prior" and "passing" theories.) To a great extent, this discussion assimilates Foucault and Dewey, as well as some of Searle, which may be of great  interest to scholars whose work crosses the analytic/continental divide. It does  not satisfy Barry Allen, however, who argues that Foucault's archeology is  not a good alternative to epistemology. In fact, Allen finds Foucault's work  to be "hostile to epistemology" (154) in its indifference to normative concepts of knowledge and truth. One suspects, however, that most  Foucault scholars will not be convinced by this account and will wish that Allen  had considered more of Foucault's work beyond <i style="">The Archeology of Knowledge</i>.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Many of these essays deal with the political  dimensions of Foucault's work. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a good analysis  of his work that ignored power, historical contexts and struggles, and  genealogy's political effects. Patton's essay stands out, however, because he places Foucault in the context of traditional political philosophy and reads  his work as a critique of normative political theory.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Beginning with a quick overview of Rawls, Patton  suggests that "Foucault's approach to the forms of governmental reason are an important supplement" (207) to Rawls' project. Rawls calls for basic economic and social justice but focuses most of his attention on the  state's constitution; he gives little analytic attention to other aspects of  political culture. Foucault, by contrast, is adamant that the state must be  understood as an historically shifting apparatus that exists -- where it does in fact  exist -- as a production of governmentality. As modes of governmentality  alter, so too will the state form. States are neither monolithic nor logically  necessary for government on Foucault's view. It is a mistake, therefore, for  political philosophers to focus their attention exclusively on the state, whether  their purpose is simply to describe the political field or to critique an  existing state or secure its legitimacy. </p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In <i style="">The Birth of Biopolitics</i> (Foucault's 1979 lectures series and Patton's primary  text), Foucault critiques what he calls "state phobia" (see Patton, 208) and puts it in historical perspective as a quest for ways to limit state  power in response to the ascendance of <i style="">raison d'etat</i> and the belief that the state form has an inherent tendency  to expand. "Foucault's objection to this essentialist conception of the  state is, firstly, that it allows its protagonists to deduce a political  analysis from first principles and avoid altogether the need for empirical and historical knowledge of contemporary reality" (208-9). This allows conflation of historical specificities to an extreme point where  important distinctions are utterly obliterated -- where, as Patton puts it,  "social security ends up referring to concentration camps" (209). It also tends  to perpetuate the idea that the state -- no matter which state might be at  issue -- is a devouring monster. Foucault's second objection to state phobia  on the left is that it can only be maintained in ignorance of the ways in which anti-state liberalism has been engaged in "an effective reduction of the state" (209) since World War II. If leftist thinkers had paid more  attention to what liberals and, now, neoliberals have been doing, they would see  that the state is not necessarily the central issue or danger anymore. It is  imperative to look at the state apparatus in the context of governmental reason and practice -- i.e., governmentality.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This is where Foucault begins his analysis of neoliberalism, according to Patton. Whereas welfare state programs used disciplinary techniques to govern, Patton maintains, "neo-liberal governmentality relies much more on the autonomy and responsibility of  citizens and, for that reason, may provide a more effective counter to the  techniques of disciplinary power" (214). Patton suggests that Foucault pursued his analysis of neoliberalism at such great length in these lectures because  he thought it might present a viable alternative to leftist critiques and techniques of resistance.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Patton's discussion is interesting and  provocative, and there is much in it that is very helpful. (And we will return to this  shortly.) However, a somewhat different reading of Foucault's interest in  neoliberalism is certainly possible. In the course summary that Foucault prepared  after the end of the semester, he acknowledged that (as <i style="">per</i> the  course title) the lecture series was supposed to have been about the birth of biopolitics, not liberalism or neoliberalism. It was necessary, he says in his own defense, to lay out the context in which biopolitics emerged, and that context was liberalism; hence the amount  of time spent on its development and variations. Divergent as it may be,  neoliberalism is not an alternative to the liberalism that spawned biopolitics.  Foucault implies that, had the series run longer, he could have shown how  neoliberalism furthered the development of biopolitics from the late 1940s forward and  how, at the time of his lectures, it may have been reshaping liberal  governmentality to accommodate and extend biopolitics in the aftermath of the collapse  of the Bretton Woods Agreements in 1971. On this reading, the analysis of neoliberalism is part of a genealogy, not a moment of advocacy for a  favored player in the political field.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">At the end of his essay, Patton returns to a  discussion of the Rawlsian citizen, a subject of interests. Foucault's work puts  this way of thinking of subjectivity into historical perspective, Patton notes,  which has the effect of putting it in question. This work, along with the  analysis of neoliberalism and examination of "new kinds of governmental reason," Patton claims, "raises questions about the adequacy of normative  political philosophies that remain grounded in juridical reason" (219). This is certainly true, and it ought to be said again and again to encourage  better work in political philosophy in general. In this respect, among others, Patton's essay does a great service.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In sum, then, O'Leary and Falzon have brought  together a good and interesting set of essays that are well worth reading. This  volume will be of interest to all scholars who work with Foucault's texts and  might be recommended to advanced undergraduate students.</p>
