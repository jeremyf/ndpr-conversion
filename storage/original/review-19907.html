	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">This  richly rewarding book brings together thirteen articles that Allen Buchanan has published over the past ten years on the topics of the  content and justification of human rights, the legitimacy of international  law-making institutions and the use of force in international relations. The  articles collected here together constitute a major contribution to the  underdeveloped field of the philosophy of international law, a field in which Buchanan  has been a leading light over the past decade. The philosophy of  international law, as distinct from international political philosophy, is characterized by  close attention to the norms currently embedded in treaty-based and customary international law, and to the moral standing of the institutions through  which those norms are specified and interpreted.
</span></p><p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">While Buchanan would, I  think, accept this characterization, he would also warn against exaggerating  the distinction between such topics and those that animate neighboring  fields, such as the ever-expanding body of philosophical work on global distributive justice. This is because one of the central take-home points of  Buchanan's book is the need to embed philosophical theorizing about international law  within a more comprehensive moral-political theory. This theme is one thread in a  more general resistance on Buchanan's part to what he sees as the excessive compartmentalization of recent moral and political philosophy: the  sequestering of theorizing about domestic justice from theorizing about global  justice; the tendency of work on human rights, institutional legitimacy and the  morality of war to proceed in isolation from each other; and -- a point that  receives special emphasis -- the failure of philosophers to integrate their  analysis of moral norms with an empirically robust comparative evaluation of the institutions that might specify and enforce those norms. The value of  this refreshing book lies as much in its function as a general model of how  to fruitfully escape these tendencies as in the many penetrating insights  that its individual chapters offer into specific questions of international  morality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">The  first section of the book focuses on human rights, a topic to which, as Buchanan notes, mainstream political philosophers have until  late paid surprisingly little attention. The first two chapters involve  intensive critical exegesis of Rawls' <i style="">Law of Peoples</i>. The first examines the way in which Rawls' use of the political liberal  notion of "reasonableness" functions (for Buchanan, illegitimately) to truncate his list of human rights, and the second critiques Rawls'  rejection of the conventional idea that human rights are grounded in characteristics  that all humans share. These articles constitute an important contribution to  intra-<span class="SpellE">Rawlsian</span> debates about how to extend  political liberalism to the international sphere, but the clarification that they provide is arguably just as useful for those of us who are not <span class="SpellE">Rawlsians</span>, and who therefore (perhaps I am projecting) can't always muster the  sustained effort ourselves to attempt to understand the more obscure passages in  that frequently obscure book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">That  said, I found the most interesting chapters in this section to be those in which Buchanan develops his own alternative conception of human rights, which he terms the "Modest Objectivist View". On this attractive conception, human rights specify the conditions necessary to  protect basic human interests against standard threats to those interests. The  view is modest because it focuses on the requirements for a minimally decent  life; it is objectivist because it grounds human rights in morally relevant  features that all humans are assumed to possess. Buchanan is highly sensitive to  the risk of parochialism involved in the task of specifying the interests  and threats that underlie human rights. He argues, however, that the proper response to this risk is not to retreat to relativism or extreme  minimalism about human rights, but instead to work to ensure that the institutions  that articulate human rights possess certain "epistemic virtues" -- for instance, an ability to take into account changing factual circumstances  and to include and accommodate diverse perspectives (pp. 89-91). The key methodological point here is that political philosophers cannot answer  the parochialism challenge purely by means of abstract moral reasoning;  instead they need to get their hands dirty, by thinking in a serious and  empirically informed way about institutional design.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">This  theme carries through into the first two chapters of the second section of the book, which contains four essays on the legitimacy of international law-making institutions. The first two chapters propose a  global public standard for the legitimacy of global governance institutions,  essential to which is the idea that such institutions "must possess certain epistemic virtues that facilitate the ongoing critical revision of  [their] goals, through interaction with agents and organizations outside the institution" (p. 106). Buchanan considers renewed attention to the relationship between justice and legitimacy (roughly, the right to rule)  to be the second great revolution in political theory that Rawls has  bequeathed us (p. 13) and these chapters do an excellent job of further clarifying  that relationship by fleshing out what legitimacy might substantively require  in the domain of international law. The second two chapters in this section  explore the challenge to the legitimacy of international law that is posed by  the potential conflict between it and domestic democracy, the first chapter  by means of a critical review of the rational choice position taken in Eric  Posner and Jack Goldsmith's <i style="">The Limits of International Law, </i>the second by means of a systematic examination  of four distinct claims of incompatibility. Buchanan concludes that, although  charges of inherent conflict are overblown, cosmopolitans committed to the  project of bringing international relations under the rule of law have  underestimated the scope for tensions between this goal and constitutional democracy, and  need to address this neglected issue if their accounts of global justice are to  be persuasive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">The  final section of the book treats several central problems in contemporary philosophical/legal scholarship on the morality of war.  Chapter 9 addresses the neglected question of which conditions must be satisfied  if state leaders are to be able to justify "pure" humanitarian intervention (<i style="">i.e.</i>,<i style=""> </i>the kind that works against the interests of the intervening state)  to their own citizens, as opposed to other states or international actors.  Buchanan argues that, on what he takes to be the dominant philosophical  understanding of the moral function of the state -- according to which "the state is a discretionary association for the mutual advantage of its members" (p. 204) -- such interventions are impermissible. He then suggests that, on  closer examination, this view of the state turns out to be incoherent, and  advocates replacing it with an alternative view, according to which the state  should be viewed in part as an instrument for promoting global justice. This  alternative position has what Buchanan considers to be the attractive effect of  rendering humanitarian intervention not only permissible <span class="GramE">but</span> obligatory in certain circumstances. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Chapters  11 and 12 consider the permissibility of preventive war and forcible democratization. The structure of argument here is similar to  that which Buchanan employs in the earlier chapters on human rights.  Departing from the traditional norm according to which war is permissible only in  response to actual or imminent attack involves serious risks of error and abuse on  the part of intervening states. However, Buchanan argues, these risks can in  principle be alleviated by the creation of new institutions, such as a  "multilateral accountability regime" (p. 286) that subjects intervening states to an <i style="">ex post</i> evaluation of their actions and has the power to impose costs in the event of a negative assessment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Chapter  10 is the most comprehensive and accessible attack that I have yet come across on Realism (the position that states are morally free to  direct their foreign policy exclusively in accordance with the national  interest), and would be an excellent addition to an undergraduate or graduate syllabus  on global justice. The final chapter is a well-chosen capstone to the book  as a whole, bringing together a number of issues treated separately in  earlier chapters, including the moral value of the rule of law, the nature of legitimacy, the relevance of state consent, the importance of "epistemic responsibility" as a condition of reasonableness, and the need for philosophers to consider alternative "packages" of norms and institutions. This chapter considers another barely explored question:  that of whether it is permissible to violate existing international law with the  aim of ameliorating the system of international law (a question to which  Buchanan offers a qualified "yes"). A particularly valuable feature of this third section of the book is its engagement with real-world public controversies, including the NATO intervention in Kosovo (Chapter 13)  and the Bush administration's decision to go to war with Iraq (Chapter 11).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">The  general moral vision for international law and politics that emerges from these papers is one of considerable attractiveness<i style="">.</i> Buchanan displays a strong commitment to the project of extending the reach and strength of global governance institutions, tempered by an equally robust sense of the moral risks and practical difficulties involved in that project. His approach to the  issues that he discusses is not mired in the stale dichotomies between  cosmopolitan and statist positions on global justice or <span class="SpellE">consequentialist</span> and deontological positions on ethics that litter much contemporary work  on international justice, which should increase the breadth of its appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">The  book's general picture of Philosophy's relation both to other disciplines and to public debate is similarly appealing. In the task of developing norms for the creation of a legitimate and just international  order, Philosophy is to play an essential but restricted role. Philosophers are  urged to abandon their habit of constructing "a list of abstract norms to be supported or debunked by free-floating philosophical argumentation" (p. 96), and instead draw on the resources of social science as well as the  views of those whose lives are at stake in this project. The way in which  Buchanan philosophizes will also be familiar and congenial to those who work in  analytic political philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Buchanan's  writing throughout is characterized by careful, serious attention to detail. He frequently operates by means of exhaustive  surveys of the argumentative terrain, such as his examination of the four distinct arguments for the incompatibility of international law with democracy in Chapter 8 (pp. 184-193), and the four different <span class="SpellE">Rawlsian</span> arguments for human rights minimalism discussed in Chapter 2 (pp.  33-48). (As usual, the price one pays for the clarity thus achieved is that the book  is not a summer beach read; the prose is sometimes burdened by digressions, a  plodding structure and a fondness for acronyms.) The conclusion of such sustained analyses is generally balanced and moderate. A characteristic Buchanan  move is to argue that: 1) yes, <i style="">contra</i> some theorists, there is a tension between <i style="">x</i> and <i style="">y</i>, but, <i style="">contra </i>some other theorists,  not a strict incompatibility; 2) we need to get clearer on the nature of the tension at issue in order to  resolve it; and 3) this will involve reframing the debate, in part by situating  it within a broader normative and empirical perspective. (See, <i style="">e.g.</i>,  Chapters 8, 12 and 13.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Perhaps  the necessary flip side of all of this attractiveness and moderation is that the conclusions of the essays collected here are not  always of the kind to set one's soul on fire. Several of the theses that  Buchanan defends -- that human rights must have some connection to human nature (<i style="">contra </i>Rawls), that the rule of international law is not inherently incompatible with domestic  democracy, that preventive war cannot be categorically ruled out -- are, when stated in a self-standing fashion, not startling. Some of the opponents that  Buchanan selects for himself -- Posner and Goldsmith, Realists -- will come  across (to philosophers, if not to legal scholars or theorists of international  relations) as too easy a target. In addition, the passage of time since the  original publication of these papers has remedied some of the gaps in the  philosophical literature that Buchanan identifies. The concluding sentence of Chapter  3, for instance, which states that philosophers must "abandon the assumption  that one can develop an adequate theory of equality for the domestic case  without theorizing about global justice" (p. 68) reads as somewhat dated, now  that every theorist of domestic justice and his dog seem to be developing a  position on global justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">A  more troubling contributor to the unsurprising nature of some of Buchanan's conclusions is the minimalist moral agenda that Buchanan sets himself. There is a striking lack in these papers of the egalitarian  impulse that animates other self-described "cosmopolitans". According to Buchanan's Modest Objectivist View, <span class="SpellE">honoring</span>  human rights requires that everyone have the opportunity, although not the  equal opportunity, for a minimally decent life (p. 55). This requirement then  becomes the central moral touchstone guiding assessments of the legitimacy of  global governance institutions (p. 116) and the core of Buchanan's critiques of Realism (Chapter 10) and the "discretionary association view of the  state" (Chapter 9). Achieving the universal protection of human rights, thus understood, is not a moral goal to be sniffed at. But it quite clearly  falls short of the robust concern with relative (as opposed to absolute)  position that characterizes the views of philosophical egalitarians. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Buchanan  argues in section 4 of Chapter 3 that the minimalism of human rights is, in principle, compatible with the egalitarianism defended by prominent philosophers of equality, once we appeal to the distinctions  between domestic and global principles of justice, and ideal and non-ideal  theory (pp. 65-66). But Buchanan provides nothing here in the way of a substantive explanation for why global principles of justice <i style="">actually  should</i> differ from domestic principles, or why concerns of feasibility <i style="">really do</i> count against more extensive ambitions at present. The point I am making here can be interpreted in a Buchanan-<span class="SpellE">esque</span> light.  Coming to a definitive assessment of Buchanan's position on the content of human  rights, and on the role that they play in the legitimacy of international  institutions and justifications for the use of force in international relations, is difficult in the absence of a broader theory of global justice and  global politics in which to situate that position. Without that broader theory, worries will linger that Buchanan has set his sights too short.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <i style=""><span style="" lang="EN-AU">Human Rights, Legitimacy and the Use of Force </span></i><span style="" lang="EN-AU">mounts  a convincing case for the claim that the three topics featured in its title cannot be fruitfully theorized in  isolation from each other. Along the way it raises many questions that have  hitherto been unrecognized or under-addressed by philosophers. Can a commitment to the  rule of law require violating existing international law? Whether or not a  state's engagement in humanitarian intervention violates the rights of other  states, does it violate the rights of the state's own citizens? How might the  character of global governance institutions serve to justify moral norms rather  than to simply enforce them? It is hard to imagine anyone who finds such  problems compelling coming away from this excellent book without a barrage of new insights and a renewed sense of the extent and scope of work that  remains to be done in this exciting field.</span>
