	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT">This book, the third by the author to use the "from-to" formula in its subtitle, aims to distinguish itself from most other recent work on its topic by its basic approach. Paul Crowther  finds that recent work on Kant's aesthetic theory, for all its historical and exegetical virtues, tends "<span style="">to see Kant's aesthetic theory as the problem to be solved rather than a basis  for problem solving</span>." Because this approach typically yields "interminable toings and froings between [Kant's] texts," Crowther dubs it "interminabilism" (p. 1). "Interminabilist" approaches to Kant's aesthetics, in his view, have several unfortunate consequences: they fail to give "a proper degree of <i>critical scrutiny and revision</i> of [Kant's] key concepts and arguments"; they "tend to avoid a sustained use of concrete examples"; they are "unacceptably self-referential" in how they explain the content of aesthetic judgments; they "tend to be constrained by a narrow concentration on Kant's own main interest -- the theory of taste," to  the neglect of his theory of fine art; and, because of this neglect, they  remain "focused on the area of his theory that is no longer of the most  pressing contemporary concern" (pp. 2-3).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Crowther seeks to remedy this imbalance by  adopting what he describes as "a relatively <i>open </i>exegetical approach . . . which favours economy in how Kant's broad outlines of argument are  interpreted, and the maximization of their potential for solving general problems in aesthetics." In contrast to "interminabilist" approaches, Crowther embraces "a significant level of critique and/or willingness to revise concepts and arguments" offered by Kant (p. 5); makes, in a few places, sustained use of concrete examples; relates Kant's conception of aesthetic judgment in the third <i>Critique</i> to the transcendental  deduction of the first; and strives to make Kant's theory, or at any rate the  theory that he derives from Kant, applicable not merely to fine art as understood in  Kant's time but even to the avant-garde of our own age.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Such is Crowther's program. Certainly his  presentation of it is not well calculated to win acceptance. Consider the term "interminabilism." Though the author asserts that it is "not a peevish characterization" (p. 1), it is certainly an invidious one. The coinage of a special "-ism" to describe a certain interpretative approach to Kant's aesthetics implies that interminability is not simply  the <i>outcome</i> of that approach but its <i>aim</i>. Crowther gives no argument to  support this uncharitable implication, nor does he give any reason to believe that commentary on other areas of Kant's philosophy is any less given to "interminable toings and froings between his texts" than is this particular specialty. Are we supposed to believe that, if only students  of Kant's aesthetic theory would put less work into trying to understand it  and more into doing philosophical work with it, they would finally do what philosophers have never been able to do, namely to get problems solved  and to bring controversy to an end?</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Further, Crowther's assertion that recent  commentators fail to subject Kant's concepts and arguments to "a proper degree of critical scrutiny and revision" is either question-begging or patently false. What degree of criticism and revision is "proper"? Proper for what purpose? No one who has read the writings of Henry Allison, Hannah Ginsborg, Paul Guyer, or the other commentators on Kant's aesthetics  named by Crowther in his opening paragraph (p. 1) could find them to be  uncritical in their treatment of their subject. On the contrary, critical evaluation  is one of the driving forces of their interpretative arguments. To be sure, it  tends to serve as a basis of selection among different possible understandings  of Kant's thinking rather than a basis for replacing that thinking, or  elements of it, with something putatively better. But that is precisely the  difference between trying to understand Kant's aesthetics and simply doing  aesthetics, perhaps under the inspiration or guidance of Kant's example. Each  enterprise has its place in philosophy. To complain that there has been too much of  the one and too little of the other is not unreasonable. But to fault those  who do the one for failing to do the other is unfair if not positively  confused.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Crowther's execution of his program is hardly  more compelling than his statement of it. Take for instance his first  chapter, "The Transcendental Deduction: Objective Knowledge and the Unity of Self-Consciousness." After a brief exposition of the argument of the second-edition deduction, the author identifies two supposed  "weaknesses" of it: first, it provides no explanation of the specific roles played by  the various categories in experience; and second, it rests on "the hugely problematic notion of the ideality of time" (p. 24). By way of remedy,  he draws on writings of Gareth Evans and Shaun Gallagher to formulate a way  of understanding the relations among self-consciousness, objectivity, and  the use of categories that makes it possible to specify the roles of the various categories, or at least structures of experience bearing some analogy to Kantian categories, without the doctrine of the transcendental ideality  of time.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">It is not clear what one is to make of such an  effort. Crowther finds fault with Kant for not providing an account of the roles  of the several categories in the "Deduction," but makes no mention of the fact that the subsequent "Analytic of Principles" is devoted to that very topic. He hauls the reader through the dark jungle of Kant's  argument only to discard most of its details and to seek illumination in the writings  of more recent (and admittedly less obscure) philosophers. His treatment of the  text is too casual to deepen our understanding of it, while his treatment of the philosophical problems with which the text is concerned inherits too  much of the obscurity of the original to be satisfying in its own right.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The same objection may be made to the remaining  chapters of the book, though they offer somewhat more of potential profit to the  reader. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with Kant's notoriously murky ideas of the  schematism of concepts and the "harmony of imagination and understanding," respectively. Crowther's reconstructions, whatever their limitations,  are certainly less murky than the originals. In chapter 4, after examining  Kant's attempt at a deduction of judgments of taste and finding fatal defects  in it, Crowther proposes a way in which its place can be taken by a  consideration of the role of formal comparison in the justification of such judgments.  Chapter 5 makes some headway against the obscurity of Kant's use of the notions of "adherent beauty" and "perfection" in his treatment of judgments of taste. Chapter 7 (to skip one for a moment) revisits what  the author terms his "austere" reconstruction of Kant's conception of judgments of sublimity, in contrast to the "baroque" approach of the original text.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The most rewarding chapter of the book is surely  its sixth, "From Aesthetic Ideas to the Avant-Garde: The Scope of Fine Art." The very idea of applying Kantian aesthetic theory to avant-garde art may seem a hopeless undertaking, as the art that Kant takes as his  subject is specifically <i>fine</i> art or beautiful art (in Kant's German, as  in the French usage that he follows, there is no verbal distinction here),  while beauty simply is not a dominating value, or even always a value at all,  for the avant-garde. But, as Crowther shows, Kant's theory is not necessarily  confined to this initial definition of subject matter: his notions of  originality, exemplariness, and aesthetic ideas have wider application. Crowther  subjects each of these concepts to critical examination and modification, but without resorting to drastic renovation. The principal change that he makes is  to use the concept of artistic style to fill in Kant's rather schematic account  of what constitutes an aesthetic idea. Where Kant says that an aesthetic  idea represents a thing of a certain kind with a "completeness" not found in nature, Crowther proposes to understand such completeness as the  distinctive way in which the individual artist exercises imagination and selection  in his or her treatment of the subject matter. Because the identification of an artist's style requires comparison of his or her work with that of  others, identifying aesthetic ideas in works of art requires seeing them in  relation to specific artistic traditions or, as Crowther puts it, in terms of a "historical/critical horizon" (p. 154). This modification of Kant's concept of an aesthetic idea elucidates its connection to the concepts  of originality and exemplariness and enables Crowther, in the penultimate  section of the chapter, to apply it to several examples of avant-garde art (pp.  165-9).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Certainly <i>The Kantian Aesthetic</i> sheds  light on some points in Kant's theories of taste and fine art. But do those bits  of illumination make it worth the trouble of reading the entire book?  Beginning students of Kant's "Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment," especially those not well acquainted with the first <i>Critique</i>,  will find the book far too heavily involved in the technical intricacies of Kant's thought to provide much help. Readers already acquainted with the first  and third <i>Critiques</i> who wish to deepen their understanding of those  texts will find Crowther's engagement with them far too superficial to provide  much instruction. Readers who are primarily interested in questions of the  nature of art and who come to the book to learn what light Kant's thought sheds on  those questions are likely to be repelled not only by the obscurity of the  Kantian original but even by the degree of obscurity that lingers on in  Crowther's reconstructions. Thus the book succeeds neither as a work of  interpretation and commentary nor as an essay in aesthetics.</p>
