	<p class="MsoBodyText">The papers in this collection all revolve around the fundamental metaphysical question of whether truths require truthmakers.<span style="">  </span>Versions of most of the papers were written for a conference at the University of Manchester, though two were written expressly for the book.<span style="">  </span>The topic is, of course, important and any philosopher interested in the nature of truth would do well to read the papers collected here.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">I think that it is fair to suggest that the philosophical figure who dominates most of the discussion in these papers is David Armstrong.<span style="">  </span>Although he has his defenders in the book, most of the authors target some aspect of Armstrong's views for criticism. Armstrong takes it to be fairly obvious that most true propositions are made true by some feature of a world that exists independently of the way it is represented.<span style="">  </span>In their clear and useful introduction to the book, Helen Beebee and Julian Dodd formulate the unrestricted version of Armstrong's principle as follows:<span style="">  </span>Necessarily, if a proposition <i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is true then there exists at least one entity </span><i>X</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> such that the proposition that </span><i>X</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> exists entails </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;">. Notice that the principle talks about the existence of </span><i>X</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> entailing the truth of </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Properly speaking, the truthmaker is </span><i>X</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> but because on most views truthmakers are themselves neither true nor false, we can't straightforwardly speak of </span><i>X</i><span style="font-style: normal;">'s entailing </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>So to say something about the truthmaking relation in terms of entailment we need to come up with a </span><i>proposition</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> asserting the existence of X.<span style="">  </span>While probably harmless for some purposes, it is worth underscoring that the truthmaking relation as traditionally conceived by, for example, correspondence theorists of truth is </span><i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a relation of entailment.<span style="">  </span>Nor is it obvious that one can properly understand it or analyze it in terms of a relation of entailment.<span style="">  </span>Indeed, for all the discussion of truthmakers and the truthmaking relation by the authors of these papers, there is very little discussion of the critical question of how one might understand truthmaking except in terms of principles about entailment between propositions.<span style="">  </span>And I think that is unfortunate.<span style="">  </span>If truthmaking is unanalyzable it is understandable that not much is said by way of analyzing it.<span style="">  </span>But </span><i>that</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> it is unanalyzable is itself an important conclusion.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It is also interesting to me that most (though not all) of the authors want to talk about truthmakers without worrying too much about truthbearers.<span style="">  </span>Again, I'm not sure that's a good idea.<span style="">  </span>To put my cards on the table, I am entirely sympathetic with Armstrong's fundamental approach to the issue of truth.<span style="">  </span>But I don't think one can get clear about truthmakers without getting clear about the nature of truthbearers.<span style="">  </span>The fundamental reason that one needs truthmakers is that the correspondence theory of truth is correct.<span style="">  </span>And a defense of the correspondence theory of truth is a package deal.<span style="">  </span>One needs to develop and defend an account of truthbearers, truthmakers, and the critical relation of correspondence that holds between the two if one is going to defend the kind of picture that grips Armstrong.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">It is difficult to review a collection.<span style="">  </span>Rather than try to summarize and critically evaluate individual papers, I'll comment instead on a number of particular themes that emerge in some of the papers.<span style="">  </span>It will be a bit of a scattergun approach, but I hope it will give the reader a feel for the discussion in the book.<span style="">  </span>My discussion will also tend to be critical. That's what philosophers tend to do.<span style="">  </span>The reader shouldn't infer from an emphasis on the negative that the papers were anything other than of uniformally high quality.<span style="">  </span>I learned a great deal from reading them.</p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Let me begin with a very general methodological observation.<span style="">  </span>As I indicated, these papers deal with one of the most fundamental of metaphysical issues.<span style="">  </span>One of the more frustrating aspects of the debate is that one can read people who purport to be disagreeing with Armstrong, but who obviously want to acknowledge the almost trivial character of some of what he says.<span style="">  </span>So virtually everyone wants to agree that if it is true that the rose is red, then it will be so because (in <i>some</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> sense of "because") the rose is red.<span style="">  </span>The truth/falsehood of the sentence/thought/assertion/proposition will depend on the way the world is, specifically the way the rose is.<span style="">  </span>Alternatively, one might use the nominalization of a sentence and acknowledge that the truth of the proposition that the rose is red depends on the rose's being a certain way.<span style="">  </span>But is </span><i>a way that the rose is</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a truthmaker?<span style="">  </span>Some seem to think that the critical question is whether we are going to embrace the way a thing is as an </span><i>entity</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (see, for example, Jennifer Hornsby's suggestion in "Truth Without Truthmaking Entities" that we shouldn't think of the use of nominalizations as carrying "heavy" ontological commitment, pp. 46-57).<span style="">  </span>But try as I might I couldn't find in the discussions any clear, satisfying criteria for determining what counts as an entity.<span style="">  </span>If there are truthmakers they will be something like states of affairs or facts.<span style="">  </span>Are facts entities?<span style="">  </span>Is a way that the world is an entity?<span style="">  </span>I wouldn't touch the question with a ten-foot pole unless I knew precisely how it has been loaded.<span style="">  </span>Does it depend, as Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra suggests (in "Why Truthmakers?," p. 23), on whether we can "count, and quantify over" such ways?<span style="">  </span>That's fine with me, but people who don't want the ways things are to be entities will surely refuse to quantify over them, and will "count" them only derivatively as they count the corresponding truths.<span style="">  </span>How many ways are such that the rose is every one of those ways?<span style="">  </span>A lot.<span style="">  </span>But, the deflationist will argue, that only means that there are a lot of true things one can say about roses.<span style="">  </span>Ontologically, one doesn't need to commit oneself to the existence of anything over and above the rose and truths about the rose (See Melia's "Truthmaking with Truthmakers" p. 81).<span style="">  </span>Quine's criterion for ontological commitment never really helps us </span><i>settle</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> any fundamental ontological controversies.<span style="">  </span>If you have good arguments for universals or states of affairs you'll quantify over them.<span style="">  </span>If you reject the existence of universals or states of affairs, you'll find some way to avoid quantifying over them -- you'll come up with paraphrases that proliferate uses of ontologically "harmless" predicate expressions.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Most all of the participants in the debate over truthmakers try to weaken the truthmaking principle (and with it, perhaps, the correspondence theory of truth) by arguing that we clearly need to restrict the principle.<span style="">  </span>We don't need truthmakers in the form of states of affairs or facts for certain true attributions of essential properties, negative existential claims, or necessary truths.<span style="">  </span>It was surprising to me that there was so much agreement on this topic.<span style="">  </span>Consider the modal truths first.<span style="">  </span>I suppose the idea is that if <i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is essentially </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, then the existence of </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by itself is enough to make true the proposition that </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, necessarily true propositions are, of course, entailed by all propositions, so it would be trivially true that the existence of any randomly selected object would entail a necessary truth.<span style="">  </span>But all this just underscores a point made earlier.<span style="">  </span>We are not getting at an understanding of truthmakers or correspondence between truthbearers and truthmakers through principles concerning entailment.<span style="">  </span>I have no idea what ontological </span><i>de re</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> necessity is (where such necessity can't be successfully reduced to </span><i>de dicto</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> necessity), but whatever is supposed to make it true that </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is necessarily </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> it is surely not the mere existence of </span><i>a.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="">  </span>Similarly, whatever makes it true that the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees is </span><i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> Caesar's having crossed the Rubicon.<span style="">  </span>Again, the moral to draw is not that there aren't truthmakers for such </span><i>de re</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>de dicto</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> necessities -- it's only that we can't capture talk of truthmakers in the way attempted by most of the authors in the anthology.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Apparently most of the philosophers contributing to this collection are particularly worried about positing truthmakers for negative existentials.<span style="">  </span>Most seem to agree that there is something paradoxical about suggesting that it is the <i>existence</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of something that makes it true that there are no unicorns.<span style="">  </span>But again, if there are truthmakers they are almost certainly going to be something like states of affairs or facts, and I don't see why someone who thinks that there are such things is going to get all bent out of shape about there </span><i>being</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> such states of affairs or facts as nothing having the property of being a unicorn, or the property of being a unicorn being unexemplified.<span style="">   </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Chris Daly ("So Where's the Explanation?") seems to suggest that it is a mark against truthmakers and the correspondence theory of truth that requires them, that it is so <i>easy</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> to come up with truthmakers.<span style="">  </span>Indeed, he seems to suggest that it is a </span><i>reductio</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of the correspondence theory of truth that even its rival theories would succumb easily and trivially to the search for truthmakers.<span style="">  </span>The coherence theorist of truth agrees, after all, that a proposition </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is true in virtue of coherence between </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and other propositions believed.<span style="">  </span>But as soon as they admit </span><i>that</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> then we have found a truthmaker for </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>The truthmaker is the fact that the relation of coherence holds between the belief that </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and some person's or group's other beliefs.<span style="">  </span>The pragmatist who goes on about truth being a function of what ideal inquirers will ultimately accept has also inadvertently stumbled upon a truthmaker for </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>The truthmaker is this fact about what ideal observers would believe.<span style="">  </span>So I gather the criticism is supposed to be that Armstrong's correspondence theory of truth replete with its truthmakers is </span><i>vacuous</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>It fails to distinguish itself from any other view of truth.<span style="">  </span>But this seems to me an odd sort of criticism.<span style="">  </span>To be sure, philosophers have always walked a fine line between saying things that are trivially true and saying things that are obviously false.<span style="">  </span>That's the price you pay for engaging in investigation that is supposed to yield necessary truths.<span style="">  </span>People who think that the correspondence theory of truth is true don't think that it just happens to be true as a matter of contingent fact.<span style="">  </span>They think that it is necessarily true, that no other theory of truth could </span><i>possibly</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> be true.<span style="">  </span>And it's hard for me to see why I should worry about the fact that alleged alternatives to the correspondence theory are actually implicitly committed to the very conception of truth they are attacking.<span style="">  </span>I think what Daly has inadvertently shown is simply that pragmatists and coherence theorists are most plausibly construed as closet correspondence theorists with odd (and obviously false) views about the contents of, and truthmakers for, various sorts of propositions.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">In my introductory comments I complained about the relative lack of discussion of truthbearers in an attempt to get clear about truthmakers and correspondence.<span style="">  </span>In his paper ("Realism Beyond Correspondence") Michael Morris complains that the correspondence theory of truth leads to a kind of implausible idealism.<span style="">  </span>The idea is that the robust realist is committed to the view that there is a reality that exists independently of the way it is represented.<span style="">  </span>But to make plausible a correspondence theory, Morris argues, its proponent will have to argue that language and reality have similar sorts of structure.<span style="">  </span>And this will be plausible only if either reality has a structure that determines the structure of language, or language has a structure that determines the structure of reality.<span style="">  </span>Morris seems to argue that the former is implausible because if that were the way of things it should be possible for reality to have a structure that was independent of the structure of sentences.<span style="">  </span>And in that case it should be in principle possible to "characterize" that propositional structure of reality in ways that do not "depend essentially on reference to the structure of sentences" (p. 52).<span style="">  </span><i>That</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> no one can do, and so we are left with the anti-realist's position that it is the structure of language that somehow determines the nature/structure of reality.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The argument is, at best, suspect.<span style="">  </span>In general, one ought to be suspicious of someone who concludes that if the structure of reality is independent of representation that we ought to be able to represent that structure without relying on representation.<span style="">  </span>In any event, most of the historically prominent correspondence theorists never thought that the primary bearers of truth value are sentences, and that the structure of <i>sentences</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> must correspond somehow to the structure of facts.<span style="">  </span>If one takes the primary bearers of truth value to be something like thoughts, it is surely much more plausible to suppose that thought latches on to a structure that reality has independent of that thought.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Marian David's contribution to the collection ("Armstrong on Truthmaking") is one that does emphasize the importance of thinking carefully about truthbearers in evaluating the kind of correspondence theory of truth that requires truthmakers.<span style="">  </span>In criticizing Armstrong's view, he points out that Armstrong wants the correspondence between thoughts/representations and truthmakers to be an <i>internal</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> relation, i.e. a relation that necessarily obtains given the existence of the relata.<span style="">  </span>He then points out a tension in Armstrong's naturalistic account of representation and his thesis concerning the relata of this internal relation.<span style="">  </span>Put crudely David's idea is that for Armstrong belief states don't have their content essentially.<span style="">  </span>Therefore it seems possible that a belief state and its truthmaker in this world, can exist in some other world in which the relation of correspondence fails to hold.<span style="">  </span>Once again David's discussion brings to the fore the critical importance of analyzing the nature of truthbearers, truthmakers, and correspondence in any critical evaluation of the question of whether there are such things as truthmakers.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">To evaluate David's specific objection to Armstrong, we would need to settle some thorny issues of interpretation concerning Armstrong's philosophy of mind.<span style="">  </span>If Armstrong identifies belief tokens with brain states (as David suggests) and identifies their content with their functional role, then it is indeed unclear how he can take correspondence to be an internal relation between token beliefs/representations and the states of affairs that are their truthmakers.<span style="">  </span>But a clear-thinking functionalist should surely worry about identifying beliefs (types <i>or</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> tokens) with brain states.<span style="">  </span>The property of believing that </span><i>P</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> just </span><i>is</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> a functional property.<span style="">  </span>It is the property of being in a state that plays a causal role.<span style="">  </span>A brain state might "realize" the functional property, but that just means that a brain state might take the value of the variable in the complex predicate that picks out the functional property.<span style="">  </span>Properly speaking, belief states are not brain states, and the identity conditions for belief states are inseparable from the causal roles that determine their content (according to the functionalist).<span style="">  </span>In any event, whatever Armstrong thinks, thought/belief is neither a brain state nor a functional state.<span style="">  </span>The most plausible correspondence theories of truth </span><i>will</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> take correspondence to be an internal relation between truthbearers and truthmakers.<span style="">  </span>That view may require a somewhat mysterious (Putnam called it magical) view of both thought and its correspondence to the world.<span style="">  </span>But one of the most common mistakes a philosopher<span style="">  </span>can make is to attempt an analysis of the unanalyzable.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Clever deflationists will always be able to find ways of "translating" talk about truthmakers into talk about unanalyzed truth.<span style="">  </span>It is difficult to come up with an argument for truthmakers that doesn't already presuppose a fairly elaborate metaphysical framework.<span style="">  </span>I certainly don't think that one is going to get very far persuading anyone of the need for truthmakers by linking their posit with objections to phenomenalism and behaviorism as David Liggins does in "Truthmakers and Explanation."<span style="">  </span>It's not that one can't legitimately complain that the contingent subjunctives needed by both phenomenalists and behaviorists need a categorical ground, but deflationists can easily capture that thought by arguing that the relevant subjunctives can't be true unless there are non-subjunctive truths lawfully connected to the truths describing correlations among sensations/behaviors.<span style="">  </span>Nor do I think we will get very far thinking about truthmakers in the context of difficult issues in the philosophy of time and the question of whether there are truthmakers for propositions about the future or so-called tenseless propositions (a topic explored by Josh Parsons in "Truthmakers, the Past and the Future").<span style="">  </span>The presuppositions of arguments for or against truthmakers should ideally be less controversial than the existence of truthmakers.<span style="">  </span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">For a similar reason, I can't get myself to worry too much about Fraser MacBride's argument <i>against</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> states of affairs (in "Lewis's Animadversions on the Truthmaker Principle").<span style="">  </span>MacBride claims that states of affairs offend against the Humean principle that there can be no necessary connections between distinct states of affairs.<span style="">  </span>The state of affairs of </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;">'s being </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is distinct from both </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> -- </span><i>a </i><span style="font-style: normal;">can exist without the state of affairs </span><i>a</i><span style="font-style: normal;">'s being </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and so can </span><i>F</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>If Hume didn't recognize that there can be complex wholes that require the existence of their parts but are not simply identical with the </span><i>set</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> or </span><i>sum</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of their parts, he should have.<span style="">  </span>Anyone interested in defending states of affairs is going to junk the version of the principle that MacBride attributes to Hume.</span></p>   So how are we going to persuade someone who isn't already convinced that there are truthmakers in the form of states of affairs or facts?<span style="">  </span>Returning to a theme running throughout my comments, it seems to me that the most straightforward way of introducing truthmakers into one's philosophical picture is to <i>start</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by thinking about truthbearers.<span style="">  </span>To adopt an Armstrongian tone, the following seems patently obvious.<span style="">  </span>Without representations of reality there would be no truthbearers.<span style="">  </span>We can argue about what makes something a representation of reality, but we had better analyze representations in such a way that they are distinct from that which is represented.<span style="">  </span>In our search for truth, we had better leave room for falsehood.<span style="">  </span>If it is obvious that a representation is distinct from that which is represented, it is equally obvious that the accuracy/correctness/truth of a representation depends on whether things are the way they are represented.<span style="">  </span>I don't care whether you call the world's being the way it is represented an entity.<span style="">  </span>It is, nevertheless, a truthmaker.<span style="">  </span>You can try to be a deflationist with respect to representation, but it's a lot harder than being a deflationist with respect to truth.<span style="">  </span>And when deflationism with respect to representation fails, that which is represented by an accurate representation will be staring you in the face as the obvious candidate for a truthmaker.</span>
