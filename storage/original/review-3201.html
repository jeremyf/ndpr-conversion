	<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Semantics Versus Pragmatics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is a collection of ten papers by some of the most influential contemporary analytic philosophers of language, preceded by an informative and accessible introduction by the book's editor.<span style="">  </span>The book is important because the papers it contains reflect a wide range of views concerning the lively debate that is currently taking place concerning how, and whether, the distinction between </span><i>pragmatics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><i>semantics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is to be drawn.<span style="">  </span>Characterizing the central issue in this way, however, is somewhat misleading as it suggests that the issue concerns merely how the technical terms 'semantic' and 'pragmatic' are to be used.<span style="">  </span>Though there is a terminological aspect to the debate, it would be a mistake to suppose at the outset that the issue is merely terminological.<span style="">  </span>In what follows I will first characterize the central issue without using 'semantic' or 'pragmatic', thereby supporting the view that the central issue is not merely about how this jargon is to be used.<span style="">  </span>I will then introduce the ten papers in the volume, showing that each paper adopts one of three general perspectives on the central issue.<span style="">  </span>Finally, I will briefly describe what I take to be the central challenge faced by each of these three general perspectives.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Consider a particular instance of a declarative grammatical sentence, say my utterance of 'She smokes'.<span style="">  </span>In the typical sort of case, my utterance of this sentence to you will result in your forming a wide range of beliefs:<span style="">  </span>You will come to believe that I just uttered a sentence, that I believe of some female person or other that she smokes.<span style="">  </span>And perhaps, if you trust me and understand me, you will come to believe that a <i>particular</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> female person, whomever I refer to with my utterance of 'she', smokes.<span style="">  </span>Let us call all the beliefs that my utterance causes you to have the </span><i>informational effects</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of my utterance.<span style="">  </span>Now only a proper part of the informational effects of my utterance are </span><i>communicated</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by my utterance, for many of the informational effects, e.g. that at the time of the utterance I was not suffering from acute laryngitis, are unintended informational effects of my utterance; only beliefs that I intended you to form as a result of my utterance are </span><i>communicated</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by my utterance.<span style="">  </span>Moreover, only a proper part of the </span><i>communicated information</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is plausibly construed as </span><i>what I said</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, where </span><i>what I said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is that portion of the communicated information that is relevant for determining the truth or falsity of my utterance.<span style="">  </span>For example, my utterance probably communicated that </span><i>I believe</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> that a certain female person, say Uma Thurman, smokes, but it seems that I did not </span><i>say</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> anything about </span><i>my beliefs</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> concerning the smoking habits of Uma Thurman or anything else.<span style="">  </span>For, suppose I was being disingenuous -- suppose I did not believe that Uma Thurman smokes.<span style="">  </span>But further suppose that I was wrong -- Uma Thurman </span><i>does</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> smoke.<span style="">  </span>If, subsequent to my utterance, you were to discover all this, you could chastise me for being disingenuous, but you could not accuse me of saying something false:<span style="">  </span>If Uma Thurman smokes, and I uttered 'She smokes', where my utterance of 'she' referred to Uma Thurman, then </span><i>what I said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> was true, regardless of the false </span><i>communicated</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> information that </span><i>I believe</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> Uma Thurman smokes.<span style="">  </span>Some aspects of what is </span><i>communicated</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by my utterance result from (your tacit knowledge of) context-invariant properties and features, i.e. the </span><i>conventional meaning</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, of the sentence-type I uttered.<span style="">  </span>For example, the fact that much of the information I communicate concerns some female person, as opposed to, say motorcycles, is due to the fact that the third-person pronoun 'she' appears in the sentence-type I uttered. But much of what I communicate, and at least some of </span><i>what I said</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, is not determined by such context-invariant features and properties of the uttered sentence.<span style="">  </span>For example, that in making my utterance </span><i>what I said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> was about Uma Thurman, and not Nancy Reagan, cannot be gleaned from the conventional meaning of the sentence-type, for the sentence-type could, in another context, be used to </span><i>say</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of Nancy Reagan that she smokes.<span style="">  </span>Thus, that my utterance </span><i>communicated</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> information about Uma Thurman, and moreover that </span><i>what I said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> was about Uma Thurman, was somehow dependent upon features of the particular context in which my utterance occurred.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">According to the orthodox view (often attributed to Grice), even though the context-invariant features and properties of an uttered sentence do not suffice to <i>determine</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> what is said by utterances of the sentence, there is nonetheless a tight connection between these context-invariant features and properties and </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by utterances of the sentence-type.<span style="">  </span>According to this orthodox view, once one resolves the lexical and structural ambiguities (i.e. determines the logical form) and determines all the referents invoked by the utterance, including the referents of all the </span><i>context-sensitive</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> elements in the uttered sentence, one thereby -- as a consequence of semantic compositionality -- fixes </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by the utterance.<span style="">  </span>Recently, however, this orthodox view has come under pressure from a barrage of apparent counterexamples.<span style="">  </span>The apparent counterexamples have the following general structure:<span style="">  </span>there are two utterances, u and u', (typically of the same sentence-type) where all that is supposed to be relevant for fixing </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> -- logical form and invoked referents -- is the same between u and u', but nonetheless </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by u and u' is intuitively different; u and u' not only </span><i>communicate</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> different information, they moreover have distinct </span><i>truth-conditions</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>For example, consider two utterances of 'She only smokes'.<span style="">  </span>Even if the overtly context-sensitive 'she' has the same referent in both contexts of utterance, the intuitive truth-conditions of the two utterances might differ.<span style="">  </span>(I am here ignoring tense.)<span style="">  </span>For example, one utterance of 'She only smokes' might be true iff Uma Thurman smokes cigarettes, but does not drink alcohol, while another utterance might be true iff Uma Thurman smokes opium, but does not eat opium.<span style="">  </span>The problem for the orthodox view is that this difference in </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> occurs even though everything that is supposed to fix what is said (logical form and invoked referents) in the two utterances at least appears to be the same.<span style="">  </span>The central issue that underlies all the papers in </span><i>Semantics Versus Pragmatics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> concerns what perspective one ought to adopt concerning such apparent counterexamples against the orthodox view.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">One might think that the appropriate perspective to adopt in response to the apparent counterexamples is to simply reject the core idea of the orthodox view, viz. that there is a tight connection between the context-invariant features and properties of a sentence-type and <i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by utterances of the sentence-type.<span style="">  </span>From this first perspective, which (following Neale) I will call </span><i>pragmatism</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, the context-invariant features and properties of a sentence-type, the conventional meaning, are insufficient to determine </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by an utterance of the sentence, and additional contextually-bound properties and processes must come into play.<span style="">  </span>The perspective of pragmatism is represented by six of the papers in the volume.<span style="">  </span>In "Pragmatism and Binding," Stephen Neale first introduces the fundamental ideas of pragmatism by way of twenty-four "points." From the theoretical perspective thus introduced he addresses the vexing question of the relationship between </span><i>bound</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, </span><i>anaphoric</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and </span><i>deictic</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> occurrences of pronouns:<span style="">  </span>Are pronouns </span><i>semantically ambiguous</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> so that these different sorts of occurrence correspond to different conventional meanings?<span style="">   </span>Or are these different sorts of occurrence the result of different </span><i>uses</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of one semantically unambiguous term?<span style="">  </span>Neale argues -- and this is somewhat surprising given his allegiance to pragmatism -- that there is substantial empirical evidence suggesting that some English pronouns are semantically ambiguous.<span style="">  </span>The same issue is addressed by François Recanati in his paper, "Deixis and Anaphora," though Recanati argues -- as one might expect a defender of pragmatism to argue -- that the different occurrences of pronouns do not result from semantic ambiguity, but are instead results of the same word being put to different uses.<span style="">  </span>Another vexing phenomenon -- vexing from the perspective of the orthodox view -- is that of </span><i>presupposition</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, and this is the topic of Mandy Simons' paper, "Presupposition and Relevance."<span style="">  </span>Simons approaches the phenomenon from the perspective of </span><i>relevance theory</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (a version of pragmatism), and argues that the </span><i>presuppositions</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of an utterance are the propositions the hearer must accept if the utterance is to be </span><i>relevant</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> for him.<span style="">  </span>Robert Stainton's paper "In Defense of Non-Sentential Assertion" defends counterexamples involving </span><i>non-sentential assertions</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> -- e.g. a use of the fragment 'completely insane' to assert that a particular person is insane -- from objections raised by defenders of the orthodox view.<span style="">  </span>After defending the legitimacy of such counter-examples, Stainton further argues that, contrary to what defenders of the orthodox view seem to think, its demise is compatible with the very plausible thesis that </span><i>linguistic</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> communication is very different from other sorts of communication.<span style="">  </span>Scott Soames' paper "Naming and Asserting" is a particularly interesting contribution to the pragmatism cause, because in it Soames argues against his previous endorsement of the orthodox view.<span style="">  </span>(See Soames, </span><i>Beyond Rigidity</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002.) It is consideration of counterexamples involving propositional-attitude ascriptions that leads to Soames' rejection of the orthodox view:<span style="">  </span>Soames argues that the price of maintaining a tight connection between </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and the context-invariant features and properties of a sentence is being forced to deny that </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by an utterances is always </span><i>communicated</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by the utterance.<span style="">  </span>Soames finds this price too high, and he thus abandons the orthodox view.<span style="">  </span>Finally, in "Context ex Machina," Kent Bach draws some important distinctions and argues in support of a position that lies somewhere between the orthodox view and pragmatism.<span style="">  </span>In accordance with the orthodox view, Bach claims that the "conventional meaning" of an uttered sentence suffices to determine </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by the sentence (though Bach cautions that this sentence meaning is not be confused with what the </span><i>speaker meant</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by performing the utterance).<span style="">  </span>But, in conflict with the orthodox view, Bach maintains that </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by some sentences is not fully propositional; some grammatical declarative sentences do not express truth-conditions.<span style="">  </span>For such "semantically incomplete" sentences, an interpreter must engage contextually bound pragmatic processes in order to determine some truth-evaluable content, and in this respect Bach's view is a version of pragmatism.</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The remaining four papers advocate amending the orthodox view in light of apparent counterexamples rather than rejecting it, but there are two general perspectives concerning how it should be amended.<span style="">  </span>The first such perspective, which I call <i>semantic maximalism</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, responds to the apparent divergence between context-invariant features and properties of sentence-types and </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by utterances of those types by positing </span><i>more</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> relevant context-invariant features and properties. Thus, when faced with an apparent counterexample involving what appear to be relevantly similar utterances u and u' which intuitively </span><i>say</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> different things, semantic maximalism rejects the premise that u and u' have the same logical form and invoke the same referents (or semantic values).<span style="">  </span>A paradigmatic version of semantic maximalism is represented by Jeffrey King and Jason Stanley in their paper, "Semantics, Pragmatics, and the Role of Semantic Content," and a more nuanced version is defended in Michael Glanzberg's paper, "Focus: A Case-Study on the Semantics-Pragmatics Boundary."<span style="">  </span>King and Stanley begin by criticizing the other perspectives on the central issue (though they refer to </span><i>pragmatism</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as "semantic skepticism" and </span><i>semantic</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><i>minimalism</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as "semantic modesty") and then they address a number of related counterexamples.<span style="">  </span>King and Stanley's analyses of the apparent counterexamples involve an interaction between two sorts of factors:<span style="">  </span>(i) effects of </span><i>focus</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, which King and Stanley treat as a "weak pragmatic effect" that is not does directly affect truth-conditions and is not represented in logical form; and (ii) "hidden indexicals," i.e. context-sensitive elements in logical form that are not phonetically realized, or at least are not overtly indexical.<span style="">  </span>Glanzberg also considers apparent counterexamples that involve the phenomenon of focus, though, in contrast to King and Stanley, Glanzberg treats focus as being represented in logical form and as directly affecting truth-conditions.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">The second perspective that endorses amending the orthodox view responds to the apparent divergence between context-invariant features and properties of sentence-types and <i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by utterances of those types by distinguishing between what is </span><i>really said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by an utterance and what is </span><i>intuitively said</i><span style="font-style: normal;">.<span style="">  </span>Thus, when faced with an apparent counterexample involving relevantly similar utterances u and u' which apparently </span><i>say</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> different things, semantic minimalism rejects the premise that </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by u and u' is really different.<span style="">  </span>According to semantic minimalism, what is really said by an uttered sentence is always truth-evaluable, but the genuine, semantic, truth-conditions of an uttered sentence almost always differ from the intuitive truth-conditions of the utterance itself. Semantic minimalism is defended by Herman Cappelen and Ernie Lepore in their paper "Radical and Moderate Pragmatics:<span style="">  </span>Does Meaning Determine Truth Conditions?" and also in Nathan Salmon's paper "Two Conceptions of Semantics."<span style="">  </span>(Semantic minimalism is also the position criticized and abandoned in Soames' paper.)<span style="">  </span>Cappelen and Lepore's paper is primarily a criticism of pragmatism which proceeds in three steps: First, they distinguish between "moderate pragmatism" and "radical pragmatism"; second, they argue that moderate pragmatism collapses into radical pragmatism; and, third, they argue that radical pragmatism is internally inconsistent.<span style="">  </span>Salmon's paper is also primarily concerned to criticize pragmatism.<span style="">  </span>He first criticizes what many take to be the historical foundations of pragmatism, the so-called "use theory of meaning," and he then argues in support of "the expression centered conception of semantics," which is roughly equivalent to semantic minimalism.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">As I do not here have the space to adequately address any of the arguments presented in the papers in any detail, I will conclude by describing in general terms what I take to be the central challenge facing each of the three perspectives.<span style="">  </span>The main threat against semantic minimalism is this:<span style="">  </span>Semantic minimalism insulates the orthodox view from the apparent counterexamples by making a hard distinction between the truth-conditions of an uttered <i>sentence</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> and the intuitive truth-conditions of the </span><i>utterance</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (or what the speaker meant by making the utterance).<span style="">  </span>But because it separates the orthodox view from utterances in this way, semantic minimalism runs the risk of making the orthodox view completely irrelevant to the study of natural language.<span style="">  </span>If the minimal, purely semantic, truth-conditions of a </span><i>sentence</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> diverge drastically from the intuitive truth-conditions actual speakers interpret an </span><i>utterance</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of the sentence as expressing -- and in order to undermine the alleged counterexamples the semantic minimalist must allow for such divergence -- then </span><i>what is the point</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of assigning such theoretical truth-conditions to sentences?<span style="">  </span>Since actual language users do not judge sentences to have such minimal truth-conditions, what explanatory work could such an assignment play?<span style="">  </span>Semantic minimalism runs the risk of preserving the orthodox view only by rendering it explanatorily </span><i>irrelevant</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> with regard to actual linguistic understanding and communication.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Semantic maximalism attempts to preserve a tight connection between the context invariant features and properties of a sentence and the truth-conditions expressed by utterances of the sentence not by positing a special sort of truth-conditions tailor-made for the task, but rather by increasing the number and/or complexity of the relevant context-invariant features and properties.<span style="">  </span>The main threat to semantic maximalism is that by always positing these additional resources in order to undermine apparent counterexamples, it will render the orthodox view explanatorily inert.<span style="">  </span>Consider, for example, an apparent counterexample involving an indicative conditional:<span style="">  </span>'If gasoline is ignited, it explodes'.<span style="">  </span>This sentence gives rise to apparent counterexamples because utterances of it express different truth-conditions depending upon all sorts of aspects of the context in which it is uttered:<span style="">  </span>Said to a smoker at the neighborhood filling-station, we might judge it to be true, but said to an astronaut in outer-space, we might judge it to be false.<span style="">  </span>The semantic maximalist can (and does) attempt to undermine such counterexamples by claiming that the indicative 'if . . . then', though not overtly context-sensitive like 'I' or 'now', is nonetheless a context-sensitive expression that refers to different logical relations in different contexts. But if the only reason for supposing that 'if . . . then' is referentially context-sensitive in this way is that doing so preserves the orthodox view, then the semantic maximalist cannot turn around and <i>explain why</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> we judge different utterances of the same indicative conditional to express different truth-conditions by appealing to the just supposed covert context-sensitivity of 'if . . . then'.<span style="">  </span>Aside from the fact that positing this additional referential complexity enables one to preserve the orthodox view, what reason is there for thinking that 'if . . . then' constructions are referentially context-sensitive in this way?<span style="">  </span>The problematic phenomenon of different utterances of the same indicative conditional expressing different intuitive truth-conditions in different contexts cannot be denied; but what reason </span><i>independent of the orthodox view</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is there for supposing that this variance in truth-conditions is a result of referential context-sensitivity?<span style="">  </span>If the semantic maximalist is to preserve the explanatory power of the orthodox view, she must provide </span><i>independent</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> reasons for supposing that the context-sensitive referential machinery she posits actually exists.<span style="">  </span></span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, the main challenge facing pragmatism is that at present it is primarily a negative view, the essence of which is the rejection of the orthodox view.<span style="">  </span>Thus the primary challenge facing the pragmatist is to provide a <i>positive</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> account of how interpreters arrive at intuitive judgments of </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by utterances:<span style="">  </span>If tacit knowledge of the logical form of, and the referents invoked by, an utterance do not suffice for making such a judgment, then what does suffice?<span style="">  </span>Moreover, this positive account must provide a new explanation of the robust intuitive distinction between </span><i>what is said</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by an utterance as opposed to what is </span><i>merely communicated</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> by the utterance.<span style="">  </span>If this distinction is not to be drawn -- as it is on the orthodox view -- by appeal to information determined by context-invariant features and properties as opposed to information not so determined, then how is it to be drawn?</span></p>   <p class="MsoBodyText">These are, in my view, the central challenges facing each of the three perspectives.<span style="">  </span>In describing these challenges, I in no way intend to suggest that the advocates of each perspective are unaware of these challenges.<span style="">  </span>Indeed, one of the reasons <i>Semantics Versus Pragmatics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> is a valuable collection is that these challenges are addressed with insight and ingenuity, and in a wide variety of ways, by the contributors to the volume.<span style="">  </span>All of this of course raises the fundamental question:<span style="">  </span>Which perspective is correct?<span style="">  </span>Alas, no clear answer to this question emerges from the volume.<span style="">  </span>Taken as a whole, the papers in </span><i>Semantics Versus Pragmatics</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> do not point to any clear conclusion of the central issue, as I have described it; nor do they suggest that we are close to agreement concerning how the semantics/pragmatics distinction is to be drawn.<span style="">  </span>They do, however, provide ample evidence that analytic philosophy of language is in the midst of a lively debate that has produced, and is likely to continue producing, important clarifications and insights.<span style="">    </span></span></p>
