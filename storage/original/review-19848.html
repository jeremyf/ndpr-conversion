	â€€<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This impressive book is  characterized by three special virtues: first, it presents difficult philosophical ideas  and developments clearly; second, it manifests an unusual and admirable  facility with both analytic and continental positions and methodologies; and  third, it boasts an extraordinary level of scholarship. My strongest endorsement  of <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> book is that I dearly wish I'd  had it two decades ago.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">A Thing of This World</span></i><span lang="EN-AU"> is carefully  structured, both in terms of <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> discussion of  developments and in his handling of operant ideas and positions. While the substantial  structure is clear enough from the Contents page and the Introduction, the basics  of the working structure need to be appreciated to insure productive reading.  Braver provides a section he labels "Guide to Matrices" at the beginning of the book, in which he articulates twelve fundamental realist and  anti-realist theses as well as five other propositions basic to discussion of the philosophers he considers. For example, "R1" is Putnam's thesis that  "the world consists of some fixed totality of mind-independent objects," and  "A1" is Hegel's thesis that "consciousness will arrive at a point at which it gets rid of its semblance of being burdened with something alien" (xix-xx). Again, a basic proposition is the "<span class="SpellE">Heideggerian</span> paradigm" or "Historical Phenomenological Ontology," namely, the view that "There is <span class="GramE">Being</span> only in this or  that historical character" (xx). Braver then proceeds in a manner reminiscent of Spinoza, referring back to individual matrix theses and propositions  almost entirely as "R3" or "A5" and with initials like "HPO." Proceeding in this manner facilitates his exposition, but it imposes on  readers the need often to refer back to the list. Additionally, Braver uses  initials to refer to no fewer than 128 works by the nine major authors he discusses,  requiring frequent checks of the abbreviations list provided (xiii-xviii).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">I mention all of this to  preempt rather than to make complaints. If Braver didn't avail himself of these  devices, the book would have been considerably longer than its 600-some pages.  Moreover, the book is a comprehensive review of complex developments over a  significant period of time, so <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> devices are  appropriate and their <span class="GramE">use justified even though they sometimes  interfere with the narrative flow and introduce</span> minor inconveniences.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The Introduction begins with a comparison of the contemporary split between analytic and continental philosophy and the split between rationalism and empiricism at the end  of the eighteenth century, a split that culminated in rationalist metaphysical  excess and empiricist epistemological bankruptcy. Braver maintains that the  ground for reconciliation of analytic and continental philosophy is "the very idea that forms the core of the Critique of Pure Reason and the linchpin of  its rationalist-empiricist synthesis" and this is "the idea that the mind actively organizes experience" (5).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">This is where <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> originality shows itself, and also where things begin to get complicated  for readers who don't approach the book with an open mind. Braver goes on to  say that the mind's organizing activity is seen as entailing anti-realism by analytic philosophers and has been extensively discussed by such  notables as Davidson, <span class="SpellE">Dummett</span>, Goodman, Putnam, Quine,  and Wittgenstein. Given Kant's influence on continental thought, the mind's organizing activity is also pivotal for continental philosophers. <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> idea is that if the two traditions'  different vocabularies are properly understood and correlated by members of each,  we will be able to "identify Kant's idea as seminal for both camps" and thereby have a basis for "informed dialogue and debate" (5).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">My first reaction to <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> proposal was to think that differences in application of Kant's idea by analytic and continental philosophers go beyond diverse vocabularies,  with the latter taking anti-realism ontologically much further than a Putnam or  Quine who mainly try to accommodate the reality of the mind's  experience-organizing role without drawing skeptical, much less <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">irrealist</span></span>,  ontological conclusions. However, recalling my own efforts to show that Foucault is a  "tacit realist," I realized that my reading of Heidegger or Derrida could well  be distorted regarding ontological claims and implications by my failure to appreciate vocabulary differences.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Braver's</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> first chapter after the Introduction is given over to the  nature of realism. He articulates the six realist matrix propositions, the first  being Putnam's about the world consisting of mind-independent objects and the  second being that truth involves correspondence between words or thoughts and  external things (14-15). This is the chapter in which Braver lays out the basic  position that contrasts with continental anti-realism. In the process he makes a statement that struck me;<b style=""> </b>while discussing the way in which background and education dispose one to  accept certain ideas more readily than others, Braver remarks that "Common  sense is largely a matter of the ideas one is used to," which speaks directly  to my reading of his exposition of Heidegger and Derrida (29). The content  of this chapter poses no problems for readers with an analytic background and demonstrates <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> understanding and  appreciation of one side of the philosophical chasm he is trying to bridge.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Chapter Two, "Kant's Revolution," is the first of three in Part One. In it Braver offers an impressively clear and solidly supported account of Kant's making "the phenomenal world mind-dependent" and his changing of "the passive  substantial knower to an active organizer of experience" (57). The first  anti-realist matrix-propositions are referenced in connection with Kant's claim that  rather than being so many givens, "objects, as appearances, conform to our mode of representation" (33). Braver stresses how fundamentally Kant's view "alters the conception of knowledge and the role the subject plays in knowing" (35). The point is to articulate clearly the truly  revolutionary nature of Kant's vision to prepare the way for what follows regarding  Hegel and Nietzsche's responses to the idea of the noumenal and how "the  difference between [being] nothing to us and nothing at all becomes hard to pin  down" (41). The chapter also includes perceptive discussion of two ideas that  prove crucial in later discussion: correspondence and the reality of the self.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Prior to the second chapter  of Part One, on Hegel, <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> exposition is readily  accessible to readers having <span class="GramE">either an analytic or continental background and</span> related predilections. Discussion of Hegel is  where what I'll call "canonical impatience" may pose problems. That this is likely is not <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> fault; his exposition  of Hegel is clear, and while the chapter runs some 54 pages, the discussion is as concise as is compatible with responsible exposition. <span class="GramE">Problems center on abandonment of the noumenal and multiplicity of conceptual  schemes.</span> Braver sums up by saying that</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">Hegel's greatest  contributions to continental anti-realism are the introduction of historical change . . . into the self with the concomitant plurality  into conceptual schemes and reality . . . and the complete dismissal of  noumena (112-113).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">He adds that Hegel  "rigorously follows out the implications . . . to reach Objective Idealism, which eliminates the distinction between an objective given and our subjective projection" (113).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The problem is why an  acknowledged conceptual instability in Kant's work regarding postulation of the  noumenal has to be resolved in favor of our undoubtedly limited conceptual ability.  It seems to be philosophical egocentricity to conclude that because we can't  really make much sense of extra-conceptual, inaccessible noumena we must conclude  that historical phenomena are all there is. Physics, for instance, would have  long since become impossible if it could not postulate directly inaccessible  causes of phenomena. What would a Hegelian physicist do with string theory? I  make this point to indicate how <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> faith in  better understanding of mutual vocabularies might not be enough to ground  productive interaction between most analytic and continental philosophers.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The chapter on Nietzsche aims  to demonstrate<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b>that "Nietzsche is not free  of the Kantian paradigm" (160). The exposition is again first-rate. Braver describes "Step Six Physics" to establish that Nietzsche doesn't successfully rid himself of something beyond the purely phenomenal. Braver concedes that "Many commentators . . . believe that Nietzsche avoids the vestiges of realism  I have saddled him with," appealing to Rorty regarding the conceptual  difficulty of avoiding implications that mind "shapes facts out of indeterminate  goo" (151). There could be no question of omitting Nietzsche in a history of continental anti-realism, but the chapter left me feeling that it is  somewhat marginal. This is likely my own fault because of my experience of  hearing and reading Nietzsche interpreted in so many ways that no one interpretation  ever seems totally convincing. In any case, the chapter on Nietzsche closes  Part One; the next chapter, "Transition," is on the early Heidegger.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Braver's</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> two chapters on Heidegger -- one 90 pages, the other 84  -- are admirably clear and should make Heidegger more accessible or at least intriguing to analytic philosophers. Central to the first of the two  chapters is explication and criticism of how realists' "exclusive focus on presence-at-hand as the sole mode of Being" both distorts our understanding of <span class="GramE">existence</span> and precludes  understanding truth as anything but correspondence to the disposition of things in the  world (165, 168). Early in his discussion of realism Braver offers a succinct statement regarding Heidegger's understanding of Being, saying that</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><i style=""><span lang="EN-AU">Being and Time</span></i><span lang="EN-AU"> outlines three modes of Being . . <span class="GramE">. :</span>  readiness-to-hand . . . , presence-at-hand . . . , and existence. Equipment, objects or things,  and <span class="SpellE">Dasein</span> are then, respectively, the  entities that <i style="">are</i> [exist] in these different ways (165).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Against this, realism limits  existence to only one sort of Being: presence-at-hand or how the world's physical furniture exists, and in this way "profoundly distorts our daily lives" (165). What makes the early Heidegger's work transitory is that while he "radically redefines both subject and phenomena, there is a strong continuity with Kant's thought, as he himself recognizes" (176). The Heidegger of <i style="">Being and Time</i> is still working with the Kantian paradigm, but the work is transitory  because it paves the way for the <span class="SpellE">Heideggerian</span> paradigm.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Braver's</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> first chapter on Heidegger, well supplied with numerous  substantial quotations, begins his most concentrated attempt to establish that  identifying the Kantian paradigm as "seminal for both camps" will provide a ground for "informed dialogue and debate" among analytic and continental philosophers (5). Two key aspects are <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> lucid restatements and explanations of Heidegger's remarks, and his  criticism of Davidson's preclusive treatment of conceptual schemes (228-50). The criticism is necessary because the Hegel-Nietzsche-Heidegger progression depends on the at least potential proliferation of conceptual schemes<b style=""><i style=""> </i></b>that result from rejecting the idea of a noumenal world. Personally, I was unconvinced by the criticism of Davidson, and my siding with realists  like Searle remained unaffected, but <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> is a  most interesting discussion and often striking, as when he compares passages  from Heidegger and Davidson. The upshot of the chapter basically is the point  Braver makes early on: "without noumena, the experienced realm that is affected by <span class="SpellE">Dasein</span> is reality itself; hence our [conceptualizing, organizing] effects on it are not distortive but constitutive" (176). The "meaning of the Being of beings" for Heidegger, therefore, "is ultimately whatever is involved in becoming present to <span class="SpellE">Dasein</span>" (184). Nonetheless, this  is the early <span class="GramE">Heidegger,</span> the Heidegger still  caught in the Kantian paradigm and held back by "his commitment to an <span class="SpellE">ahistorical</span> permanent structure of the self"  (253).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">The second chapter on  Heidegger, "The Great Turning Around," begins with a summation:</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span lang="EN-AU">For  the thinkers of the Kantian Paradigm . . . Active Knower's faculties partially  constitute . . . dependent reality by either organizing it with space, time, and the categories (Kant), volatilizing historical movement (Hegel), congealing  chaotic flux (Nietzsche), or <span class="SpellE">temporalizing</span> into the  forms of engaged instrumentality or disengaged inertness (early Heidegger) (257).  </span><span style="" lang="EN-AU"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">According to Braver, the  later Heidegger's abandonment of truth as correspondence in favor of <span class="SpellE"><i style="">aletheia</i></span> or "<span class="SpellE">unconcealment</span>"  enables him to also abandon realism of the subject, and so to leave the Kantian paradigm behind in establishing  the <span class="SpellE">Heideggerian</span> paradigm: "In his later  work, Heidegger places everything within history; there is nothing essential and  self-same that transcends historical change." There is no Cartesian ego, no Kantian  self; "for anyone who wishes to escape the subject-<span class="SpellE">centered</span> philosophy of the Kantian Paradigm, later Heidegger is the unavoidable  thinker" (260). This is how Heidegger established "the first genuinely  non-Kantian position in the continental tradition" and why the later Heidegger is of such great importance to the development <span class="GramE">of<span style="">  </span>continental</span> thought (253). For Braver, Heidegger's abandonment of truth as some sort of correspondence,  and of the underlying picture of thought/assertion relating to objective states-of-affairs, is "a new beginning in the history of Western thought" (259). He goes on to say that this is why "recent continental philosophy can appear so strange: it operates outside of assumptions that have widely been considered necessary for all  discourse," and aptly refers to Searle as an example of philosophers who resist the <span class="SpellE">Heideggerian</span> shift (260).</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span lang="EN-AU">Foucault certainly escapes  the Kantian paradigm; for him the self, the subject, is constructed: a product of  practices and power-relations. <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> seventh  chapter, on Foucault, is again first-rate with respect to exposition. It is with  respect to interpretation that my reservations increase. Though Foucault himself  may have described Heidegger as the essential philosopher for him, <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> efforts to show that Foucault "is best read as a disciple of Heidegger" left me unconvinced (427). This is especially true when  Braver discusses a "serious problem" Foucault faces regarding inconsistency between his own goal to provoke change regarding subjectivity and his  alleged "allegiance to the <span class="SpellE">Heideggerian</span> Paradigm's Historical Phenomenological Ontology" (421). In my view, Foucault's rejection of "deep" abstractions and philosophizing about them precludes any such allegiance. Heidegger inspired and to a great extent  enabled Foucault's thought; that did not make Foucault a disciple of Heidegger.  I'm almost out of room, so will gratefully forgo commenting on <span class="SpellE">Braver's</span> last substantive chapter, the one on Derrida. I'm sure the exposition is  as good as in previous chapters, but I don't know Derrida well enough to  say more.</span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-AU">Braver's</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> Conclusion illustrates his fairness and facility with  both continental and analytic positions: he considers some of the important differences between analytic and continental philosophy. In the end,  does <span class="GramE">Braver</span> make his case that appreciation  of the role of the Kantian paradigm and clarification of vocabulary will provide common  ground for productive interchange between analytic and continental philosophers?  What he does do is succeed remarkably well at making the continental progression  from Hegel through Derrida clear and intriguing to analytic philosophers. To a lesser extent, in rehearsing the elements of the progression he makes  analytic philosophy clear and accessible to continental philosophers. But two  major factors impair the sought <i style="">rapport</i>. One is that however well explained, anti-realism won't wash with most  analytic thinkers. The idea of a noumenal, an inaccessible-as-is, reality is  admittedly problematic, but so is that of light as both waves and particles. The other is a  point Rorty makes, which Braver himself quotes in a note -- namely, that it's  pointless to try to bridge the analytic/continental split because it's not a matter  of the two sides addressing the same problems with different methods but rather  that they address different problems (515; Rorty, <i style="">The  Consequences of Pragmatism</i>, 225-26).</span></p>
