	â€€<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">This volume brings together twenty-four chapters in philosophy and neuroscience, spanning a  gamut of topics from reduction and mechanistic explanation to the <span class="SpellE">neurophilosophy</span> of subjectivity. The primary philosophical authors sometimes have cross appointments in cognitive or neural science and sometimes team up with practicing scientists. As the editor explains in his brief introduction,  he selected philosophical authors who had shown some engagement with actual neuroscience and imposed only two conditions on them: that they "make direct appeal to data and evidence from some recognized field of current neuroscience," and that they "consider collaborating with a neuroscientist" (seven actually did) (p. 4). He did not provide topical constraints but asked his authors "to cover whatever they thought most interesting" (p. 5). The resulting volume is a survey of the interests  of its authors, who sometimes provide context and framework for a specific  issue in neuroscience and its philosophical connections and sometimes simply summarize their own recent work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The editor chose the title <i style="">P<span class="SpellE">hilosophy</span> and Neuroscience</i> in order to  accommodate two somewhat different relations between philosophy and neuroscience. The  majority of the essays are instances of what the editor describes as "philosophy  of neuroscience," that is, of "philosophical reflections on neuroscience's emerging foundational questions" (p. 3). Philosophy of neuroscience is, in this regard, like philosophy of physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, or economics. It takes a living body of science as  its starting point and addresses methodological, theoretical, and conceptual questions that arise from ongoing empirical and theoretical practice.  This sort of philosophy of science goes back to the day when philosophers  regularly engaged directly with science and contributed to its literature, that  is, back to Aristotle, and it continues up through William James and C. L. Hardin  and a host of present day practitioners, including many of the authors in this volume. The second type of approach covered by the title is "<span class="SpellE">neurophilosophy</span>," which, in the words of the  editor, now stands for "the application of <span class="SpellE">neuroscientific</span> discoveries to traditional philosophical concerns" (p. 4). The origin of this sort of philosophy depends on one's perception of when "<span class="SpellE">neuroscientific</span> discoveries" first occurred, and  so might go back to ancient theories of the senses in relation to  knowledge, or to Descartes' appeal to the phenomena of the phantom limb in his  discussions of knowledge, or to Helmholtz's epistemological writings that drew on his  work in the physiology and psychology of color and spatial perception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Within these categories, the first fourteen chapters fit into philosophy of  neuroscience and the subsequent ten chapters count as <span class="SpellE">neurophilosophy</span>. The fourteen are loosely divided into four parts: explanation,  reduction, and methodology; learning and memory; sensation and perception; and <span class="SpellE">neurocomputation</span> and <span class="SpellE">neuroanatomy</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The chapters on reduction and methodology most strongly connect with recognized topics  in the philosophy of science. William Bechtel's chapter makes a good starting  place, as it <span class="GramE">introduces</span> a further distinction among  brands of neuroscience and relates it to attitudes toward reduction. Specifically, Bechtel distinguishes between the majority of neuroscientists, who take a "cellular and molecular" approach, and a smaller group that focuses on "systems, behavioral, and cognitive neuroscience" (p. 13). He also identifies two groups of philosophers of neuroscience, who are  reductionist but who align themselves with one or the other model of reduction according  to their views of how reduction will play out. The "ruthless reductionists" foresee a direct reduction of mental function to cellular and molecular processes; they include the volume's editor, <span class="SpellE">Bickle</span>. Members of the second group (more numerous in Bechtel's estimation) are attracted to systems neuroscience as a framework within which to engage  in a "mechanistic reduction" that relates systems and behavioral level description to a potential hierarchy of levels of analysis, eventually  ending with cells and molecules (p. 14). By contrast, the ruthless  reductionists (true to their origins in <span class="SpellE">Quinean</span> <span class="SpellE">neurophilosophy</span>) don't believe that there are systematic results at the higher cognitive  and behavioral levels to be reduced. Bechtel favors the systems view along  with mechanical reduction via multiple levels, although he believes that,  within the population of actual neuroscientists, this outlook is in the minority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Sarah Robins and Carl Craver apply the ideas of mechanistic explanation to the phenomena  of biological clocks. They focus on an allegedly new analysis of mechanisms  in psychology and neuroscience. As they observe, the term "mechanism" in contemporary neuroscience does not connote a classical machine, or a "heroic simple" machine, or a machine "that works according to the principles of Newtonian mechanics" (p. 42). Rather, a mechanistic explanation invokes the organization and activities of constitutive  parts in explaining how a process is carried out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Here they simply reflect the common usage of the notion of "mechanism" in psychology, physiological psychology, cognitive science, and the philosophy of  psychology, in which complex processing mechanisms came to be emphasized in the  explanatory scheme during the 1960s, with possible physiological realization also envisioned. An early summary of the relevant scientific research, with  appeal to "complex mechanisms" and their physiological realization, may be found in Peter Lindsay and Donald Norman's <i style="">Human Information Processing</i> (New York: Academic, 1972). While complex  systems had long been posited in the analysis of psychological capacities, going  back to Descartes' animal machines, philosophers were quick to pick up on  these newly prominent conceptions in psychology, as did Jerry Fodor (1968), Robert  Cummins (1975), and John <span class="SpellE">Haugeland</span> (1978).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a></sup> (Fodor of course futilely promoted the irrelevance of physiological  mechanisms to his complex psychological mechanisms, but that does not take away  from his invoking complex, decomposable, psychological mechanisms.) The chapter  by Robins and Craver contributes a detailed analysis of a particular type  of complex mechanism (a biological clock) that can be described at a  functional level and ultimately related to <span class="SpellE">neurophysiological</span> mechanisms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alcino</span></span><span style=""> Silva and <span class="SpellE">Bickle</span> revive the idea of the scientific study of science, or what they term  the "science of research" (p. 91). They focus on two "puzzles" about contemporary research. One is the "inefficiency" of "institutionalized science," by which they mean the low number of citations accrued by most research articles. In a well-known citation  index, only about half of articles with the keyword "cognition" received more than two citations, as did only about a third of those with  keywords "learning" and "memory" (p. 94). (They don't say whether they excluded newly published articles from these numbers.) The other is  the "puzzle" of why multi-level reduction remains the goal in the philosophy of neuroscience, as opposed to <span class="SpellE">Bickle's</span> conception of direct molecular reduction. The authors present a  hypothesis, called the "convergent four," to describe criteria that they claim are "jointly sufficient for fully establishing causal hypotheses in actual, current scientific research" (p. 100). The four are:  observation; negative alteration (decreasing the magnitude of a putative causal  factor); positive alteration; and integration (what Watson and Crick did for DNA,  or <span class="SpellE">Hebb</span> for cell assemblies). They  illustrate the four with a case study that speaks in favor of molecular and cellular reduction for  memory consolidation, and they compare the four to previous proposed causal  tests, such as J. S. Mill's methods. Finally, they claim that low citation  scores result from the fact that much research simply adds support to an  already well-established relation that falls under one of the four; greater  attention to the four allegedly would allow researchers to determine where new  work needs to be done and thus generate novel research articles that garner higher  scores on citation indices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Anthony <span class="SpellE">Chemero</span>  and Charles <span class="SpellE">Heyser</span> describe "object exploration" techniques used in research with rodents. From four empirical studies, they conclude that the relevant  notion of an <span class="SpellE">explorable</span> object demands a "wide  brain-body-environment system" (p. 86). They contend that such a system cannot be reduced, explanatorily or ontologically, to neuroscience; rather, neuroscience is  only part of the picture and must be supplemented by environmentally embedded  or "extended" cognitive systems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The remaining articles on the philosophy of neuroscience take up specific problems or concepts in learning, perception, and <span class="SpellE">neurocomputation</span>. Colin Allen, James <span class="SpellE">Grau</span>, and Mary Meagher  examine results that demonstrate spinal cord learning and that in some ways  challenge the notion that higher cognitive concepts must be used to describe  learning more generally. Alex Rosenberg contends that results from <span class="SpellE">neurogenomics</span> on memory consolidation in <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Aplysia</i></span>  (sea snail) and <i style="">C. <span class="SpellE">elegans</span></i> (nematode worm) cast doubt on symbol-crunching models of cognitive representation by suggesting that  actual neural mechanisms only probabilistically approach the clean syntax of  such models. He concludes that without its vehicles, original and also  derived intentionality must be jettisoned. <span class="SpellE">Machamer</span>  in effect counters by showing that much neuroscience of learning is built on  behaviorist models and contending that such models cannot explain how neural nodes  in <span class="SpellE">associationist</span> nets gain content.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">In the section on sensation and perception, Valerie <span class="SpellE">Hardcastle</span>  and Matthew Stewart ask whether <span class="SpellE">fMRI</span> counts as a  modern <span class="SpellE">cerebroscope</span> for detecting whether a  person is actually in pain. They provide a brief tutorial on <span class="SpellE">fMRI</span>  and speculate that use of the technique may lead to physical, as opposed to phenomenal, criteria for someone's being in pain. <span class="SpellE">Mazviita</span> <span class="SpellE">Chirimuuta</span> and Ian Gold review results that  tell against the notion of static receptive fields in the visual cortex, as associated with the names of Hubel and Wiesel, and in favor of a dynamic  notion of receptive field that is tied to the environment. The other two  chapters contain critiques of "enactive" <span class="SpellE">sensorimotor</span> conceptions of perception. Brian <span class="SpellE">Keeley</span>  compares Aristotle, Johannes <span class="SpellE">MÃ¼ller</span>, and Alva <span class="SpellE">NoÃ«</span> on the relation between sense organs and  sensory modalities, contending that the latter goes too far in detaching  modality from organ. Charles Wallis and Wayne Wright maintain that extreme forms of <span class="SpellE">enactivism</span> are conceptually flawed and not well  supported by the empirical research on which their claims purportedly are based.  They remain sympathetic to less extreme urgings of the importance of action  for perception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The three articles on <span class="SpellE">neurocomputation</span> summarize results by  their authors. Rick <span class="SpellE">Grush</span> presents his emulation  theory of representation; Chris <span class="SpellE">Eliasmith</span> describes  his neural engineering framework for theoretical or computational neuroscience; and  Chris <span class="SpellE">Cherniak</span> reviews some results on  neural wiring and computational complexity, connecting his findings with the <span class="SpellE">anthropic</span> principle in modern physics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The subsequent two sections contain four chapters on aspects of <span class="SpellE">neuroethics</span>, namely motivation (Anthony <span class="SpellE">Landreth</span>),  decision-making (Patricia <span class="SpellE">Churchland</span>), <span class="SpellE">emergentism</span> and the enhancement debate (Eric Racine and Judy <span class="SpellE">Illes</span>), and  what's new in <span class="SpellE">neuroethics</span> (Adina <span class="SpellE">Roskies</span>). These sections also include chapters on  phantom limbs and other aspects of bodily perception (William <span class="SpellE">Hirstein</span>), delusional experience (Jennifer <span class="SpellE">Mundale</span> and  Shaun Gallagher), and the use of animal models of emotion in analyzing neuropsychiatric disorders (Kenneth <span class="SpellE">Sufka</span>,  Morgan Weldon, and Colin Allen).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">In the final section, on <span class="SpellE">neurophilosophy</span>, Kenneth <span class="SpellE">Aizawa</span> and Carl Gillett examine massive multiple  neural realization and its implications for reduction in the case of molecules  in ocular photoreceptors. They argue that there is great variation in the realization of functions at all levels but that this does not argue  against inter-level theoretic constraints and indeed is consistent with a  co-evolutionary strategy for research across levels. Owen Flanagan reflects on the  aftermath of his publishing an earlier article examining <span class="SpellE">fMRI</span> images of a meditating Buddhist monk's brain. Pete <span class="SpellE">Mandik</span> discusses some of his <span class="SpellE">Churchland</span>-inspired  work on consciousness and subjectivity, emphasizing that neural models, such as opponent-processing color systems, can yield novel predictions about qualitative experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The title of this volume, <i style="">The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Neuroscience</i>, invites reflection on the modern notion of the  handbook. When Helmholtz published his <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Handbuch</i></span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE">der</span> <span class="SpellE">physiologischen</span>  <span class="SpellE">Optik</span></i> (Leipzig: Voss, 1867) in the  1850s and 1860s, the standard for the <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Handbuch</i></span> was clear: it should provide a comprehensive overview of the main  findings and theoretical viewpoints in physiological optics, that is, in the  scientific theory of vision. This should include a background section on ocular  anatomy, and a thorough treatment of the main divisions of the subject: the <span class="SpellE">dioptrics</span> of the eye; the sensations of vision,  including color vision; and the perceptions of vision as organized in space and as dependent on eye movements, binocular vision, and underlying  psychological processes. There should be a comprehensive literature review and a  description of the history of thought for each of the more particular topics within  the broad divisions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">Such a comprehensive treatment soon was beyond the abilities of single  individual, and <span class="GramE">the third edition of Helmholtz's <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Handbuch</i></span> was published by a committee, who provided addenda to Helmholtz's original chapters and  appendices on added topics</span>. In 1934, Murchison published a <i style="">Handbook  of General Experimental Psychology</i> (Worcester: Clark UP) that covered "<span class="SpellE">adjustive</span>" processes (motivation, emotion, and learning) and "receptive" processes (sense perception) in twenty individually authored chapters. These chapters  surveyed the literature in roughly the first three decades of the twentieth  century. In 1951, Stevens edited his <i style="">Handbook of Experimental Psychology</i> (New York: Wiley), which covered the main  divisions of the subject, from physiological mechanisms to human performance, in thirty-six separately authored chapters. These surveyed the literature  in roughly the two previous decades. Such handbooks provided advanced  introductory treatments of a subject matter for upper-level students and for working professionals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The present handbook does not aim for this sort of comprehensiveness, either in its treatment of topics or in its approach to the literature. For instance,  the methodological chapters either focus on the debate over multi-level vs. ruthlessly molecular and cellular reduction or treat a specific  experimental paradigm, object exploration. These topics are worthy of discussion and  the case study on object exploration gets down to brass tacks. Still, one  might have hoped for additional methodological questions to be addressed,  including the logic of using <span class="SpellE">fMRI</span> to study  systems-level functionally characterized processes, and a more general discussion of  brain recording methods and their application. The logic of other methods in neuroscience, such as inferring normal function from <span class="GramE">brain-damage</span> caused deficits, also would warrant discussion. Further, the very  division between systems level neuroscience and cellular/molecular neuroscience  might have been explored more fully in relation to various subject areas,  including sense perception and emotion. Indeed, the lack of a section devoted to neuroscience and emotion is noteworthy. The editor tacitly justifies the  lack of <span class="SpellE">systematicity</span> in the division of topics  by <span class="GramE">explaining that</span> "philosophy and  neuroscience is a field that continues to define itself" (p. 5). In the end, the volume is more like a collection of the research of a selected set of authors than the construction of a handbook intended to survey a field. This  characteristic shows up in the citations of most of the chapters. The chapters in  philosophy of neuroscience cite few philosophical authors writing on neural  specifics of the brain-mind relations except for themselves, <span class="SpellE">Bickle</span>, Bechtel, the <span class="SpellE">Churchlands</span>, and Craver. There  is no attempt to provide an overview of the literature in philosophy and neuroscience, something that might have been deemed comparatively  feasible in a young field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">It may be that, in relatively new fields, it takes more than one try to achieve an  appropriate balance. Thus, when Louise Barrett, Robin Dunbar, and John <span class="SpellE">Lycett</span> published their 2002 textbook on <i style="">Human Evolutionary Psychology</i> (Princeton: Princeton UP), they in effect  equated the field with the massively-modular, evolutionary-environment-of-<span class="SpellE">adaptedness</span>-evolutionary psychology (MMEEA-EP)  approach that its originators (<span class="SpellE">Tooby</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cosmides</span>) believed should define that field. This had the effect of appropriating  the name of a whole field for one theoretical position within the field.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a></sup> By the time Dunbar and Barrett edited <i style="">The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology</i> (Oxford: Oxford UP,  2007), they apparently saw the need to take a more balanced stance, and they adopted Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Heyes's</span> notion of an "evolutionary psychology in the round,"<sup><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></sup>  which went far beyond the emphasis on mating and attractiveness of the MMEEA-EP  approach arising from social psychology and sociobiology, to engage the extant literature in the evolution of cognition and mind and to connect with  evidence and theorizing from <span class="SpellE">paleoanthropology</span>,  archaeology, geology, anthropological genetics, comparative psychology, and more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">More generally, it is surprising in a philosophical handbook not to find a chapter on the  history of neuroscience and physiological approaches to psychology, in  philosophical connection.<sup><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[4]</span></span></a></sup> Bechtel admirably endeavors to supply a small portion of this history,  but as this occurs in the midst of his systematic attention to other issues it  is necessarily sketchy. In Bec<span class="msoIns"><ins cite="mailto:Jennifer%20Rosato" datetime="2010-04-29T14:57">h</ins></span>t<span class="msoDel"><del cite="mailto:Jennifer%20Rosato" datetime="2010-04-29T14:57">h</del></span>el's accounting, molecular and cellular neuroscience begins about 1962  through the work of Frank Schmitt. Systems neuroscience emerges from brain  physiology going back to the nineteenth century, behavioral neuroscience takes up the  torch from physiological psychology in the 1980s, and cognitive neuroscience arises  in the late 1980s. Taking the early part of Bechtel's focal period, other  events would have been worthy of note, including the founding of an interdisciplinary Institute of Neurological Sciences in 1953 at the University of  Pennsylvania, Roger Sperry's appointment as Professor of Psychobiology at Cal Tech in  1954, and the publication in 1958 of papers from an interdisciplinary seminar bringing together "anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and behavior" at Wisconsin in the 1950s, as well as the <span class="SpellE">ocurrence</span>  of other nationally organized seminars studying the relation between the biological and biochemical sciences and mental health (including normal  mental processes).<sup><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></sup> Psychobiology, psychophysiology, and physiological psychology were terms invented in the nineteenth century and which named approaches that were  taken throughout the twentieth century. These approaches are part of the  history of what are now called the neurosciences, and that history should include  figures such as Karl <span class="SpellE">Lashley</span>, Frank Beach, Harry  Harlow, and Karl <span class="SpellE">Pribram</span> (to name only a few of those  active in the middle third of the twentieth century). Assuming, of course, that  the history of neuroscience is not to be defined as the history of  scientists who called themselves neuroscientists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="">The volume is to be commended for collecting chapters that address issues of reduction,  intentional <span class="SpellE">eliminativism</span>, <span class="SpellE">enactivism</span>, and the extended mind, as well as several nuts-and-bolts case studies in  the practice of neuroscience. Depending on one's specific interests, there  is more or less to find. It is a good starting place especially for those  interested in current controversies in the <span class="SpellE">neuroscientific</span> reduction of memory consolidation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <div style="">
