	<p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style="">Feminist Epistemology and American Pragmatism: Dewey and Quine</i> by Alexandra  Shuford is the third in a recent series of books from Continuum that will be of interest to those following debates within feminist epistemology and  philosophy of science (the other two books are<i style=""> Rationality and Feminist Philosophy</i> <span class="author">b</span>y  Deborah K. Heikes, <a href="http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=22269">reviewed earlier this year in NDPR</a>, <span class="edition">and</span> <i style="">Objectivity in the Feminist Philosophy of Science</i> <span class="author">by </span>Karen Cordrick  Haely). Each of these three books is authored by philosophers new to these debates, consistent with Continuum's mission to "actively seek out the emerging generation." These slim volumes are not inexpensive  ($120.00 each and not available in paperback), but each contains something of  value.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">The strength of Shuford's presentation is her  application of Dewey's theory of inquiry to the problem of the high rate of  caesarean sections in US hospitals. This latter problem is serious and Shuford's  analysis is a welcome addition to feminist attempts to address it. This key  chapter, "Feminist Pragmatist Inquiry," is the last of six that also include "Birthing Feminist Pragmatist Epistemologies," "Quine's Naturalized Epistemology," "Antony's Analytic Feminist Empiricism," "Nelson's Holistic Feminist Empiricism," and "Dewey's Theory of Inquiry."</p>  Shuford's main thesis is that Nelson and Antony's feminist use of Quine, though in the right pragmatist spirit, still  fails to acknowledge fully the embodied nature of knowing that is captured by  Dewey and is necessary for understanding and criticizing phenomena such as the  over-use of caesarean sections in the US. That feminist empiricist accounts are  not attentive enough to issues of embodiment is an important point, echoed  by Kristen Intemann in her recent <i style="">Hypatia</i> essay "<span style="line-height: 115%;">25 Years of Feminist Empiricism and Standpoint </span><span style="line-height: 115%;">Theory: Where Are We Now?" However, as I discuss below, I would rather </span><span style="line-height: 115%;">that Shuford focused more on her  positive project with Dewey and less on what seem, in the main, like warmed over  and inadequate sketches of Cartesian epistemology and feminist rejections of  it. Her discussion of Nelson's (1990) and Antony's (1993) feminist use of  Quine is more original, but uncontextualized vis-Ã -vis more recent debates, and  in any event not obviously necessary for making her points about Dewey as  applied to the growing problem of caesarean sections.</span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><o:p></o:p></span>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="line-height: 115%;">In Chapter 1, </span>"Birthing Feminist Pragmatist Epistemologies," Shuford begins with a by now familiar refrain: traditional "<i style="">s</i>  knows that <i style="">P</i>" models are inadequate (see Lorraine  Code), knowers are embodied, and this matters. This overview continues in her second  chapter, where Shuford presents "A Brief History of Objectivity in Western Philosophy." It is all Descartes' fault (see Susan Bordo). Perhaps I am sensitive to the rehashed feeling of this material because it is so  close to my own introductory and admittedly overly simple treatment of it in the  first two chapters of my <i style="">Beyond Epistemology: A Pragmatist Approach to Feminist Science Studies</i> -- a book nowhere mentioned, even critically, by Shuford. In fact, Shuford does not  mention, let alone engage, any feminist discussions of Quine, Davidson, Rorty, or  other contemporary pragmatists published later than Nelson's 1990 book and  Antony's 1993 essay. This despite the more recent revisiting of these discussions  in Nelson's 2003 collection <i style="">Feminist Interpretations of Quine</i> and her 2004 <i style="">Hypatia</i> Special Issue on feminism and naturalism, co-edited with Alison Wylie,  which contains a number of essays addressing Quine and Davidson.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Once Shuford moves to her discussion of Quine's naturalized epistemology, especially Quine's argument in "Two Dogmas," things pick up considerably. "Two Dogmas" is an essay every philosopher claims to know, sort of; but I'm going to go out on a  limb and bet that only a much smaller subset of these have read through it  carefully and/or really understand it. I used to. I think. I blame problems in comprehension on Quine's engagement with Kant, but Shuford walks her  reader carefully through this material, which is very much appreciated. Her  discussion of his holism and the metaphor of the web of belief is similarly  well-executed.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">One concern in her presentation of Quine arises  when Shuford describes Quine as an uncritical proponent of conceptual schemes  (e.g., p. 25). The relativism that arises from this acceptance has been  well-discussed in the feminist and other analytic literature, e.g., Davidson's "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme," (Davidson [1974] 1984) though Shuford does not mention this discussion. The usual route for saving Quine from relativism is to argue that he rejects the notion of conceptual schemes  (this is a route that Nelson takes). Shuford, however, embraces Quinean  relativism and considers it a strength. She argues that by acknowledging the  conceptual schemes that organize our evidential analyses, i.e., the schemes to  which every evidential analysis is relative, we can better articulate "the role of historical and social context" that operate in the context of discovery (p. 46). I have argued (Clough 2004) that this sort of Quinean  relativism is a wrong-headed approach for feminist epistemologists who properly want to acknowledge the role of historical and social context in knowledge  production. It robs us of the prescriptive force we need as feminists. My concern  here makes for a good lead in to Shuford's discussion of Antony's 1993 essay "Quine as Feminist," where Shuford is critical of Antony's attempts to address Quinean relativism.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">According to Shuford, Antony's analysis of Quine  gives us the tools we need to solve what Antony has called the "bias paradox" -- that is, the problem of differentiating epistemically negative biases  (say sexism) from epistemically positive biases (say feminism). However, says Shuford, Antony solves the paradox only by reconceiving Quine's  relativism and introducing to his work, instead, a "modest realism" (p. 55). I think that solving the bias paradox is crucial for feminists, but if we need  to so radically reconceive Quine in order to reach a solution, then this is a  good reason to reject Quine. As I mentioned, Shuford thinks that Quine's  relativism is a strength and so rejects not Quine, but Antony's realist  re-interpretation of Quine. But why then introduce Antony's essay at all? Shuford wants to  get us to Dewey, and I am not sure how this discussion helps us reach her goal.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">However, there is still one more chapter before  Dewey is introduced and that is the chapter devoted to Nelson's book on Quine  (Nelson 1990). Here, Shuford makes the controversial point that, unlike Antony,  Nelson embraces a certain amount of relativism in her use of Quine, namely in  Nelson's acceptance of Quinean conceptual schemes that are consistent with, and  evidence of, Nelson's support of postmodern and feminist standpoint epistemology  (p. 64). This is a particularly unusual reading of Nelson and needs to be  more responsible to more recent work by Nelson, where her rejection of  various postmodern accounts of evidence is fairly clear (even as early as, e.g.,  Nelson 1993). At the end of this chapter, as with her discussion of Antony,  Shuford tempers her initial enthusiasm with a cautionary note, in this case that  Nelson "overlooks the <i style="">embodied</i> aspects of human existence" (p. 86).</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the penultimate chapter, Dewey's theory of  inquiry is presented. This discussion is good and very persuasive. Shuford  references other feminist presentations of classical pragmatism by Charlotte  Haddock Siegfried, Lisa Heldke, and Shannon Sullivan and makes good use of  Dewey's notion of "habit." She concludes: "Dewey's theory of inquiry establishes a link between knowledge and the necessity of human  embodiment . . . and provides a way of understanding how gender differences among  bodies enter into knowledge processes" (p. 112). She then aims to augment Dewey's inquiry to produce a "Dewey-Nelson hybrid epistemology" (p. 113). Perhaps because I am not compelled by her interpretations of Quine or  Nelson, I am unclear on what she hopes to get by augmenting Dewey in this way. It  would seem that adding to Dewey some feminist details about embodiment would  give Shuford the same effect, without tying her to a particular (and  problematic) reading of Nelson and/or Quine.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">In the final chapter, Shuford makes use of  Dewey's embodied notions of habit to support midwifery as against the  medicalization of childbirth, particularly the medicalization that contributes to the  alarmingly high rates of caesarean sections in US hospitals. The prescriptive  features of Dewey's epistemology support midwifery in terms of "bodily habits" concerning "time, technology, and touch" (p. 122). Shuford makes a compelling argument that on each of these matrices, traditional  midwifery is an improvement over standard hospital practice and makes for better birth  outcomes for both mothers and babies.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">I hope that Shuford continues this discussion  (and in more accessible venues). It is becoming an increasingly important part  of debates about healthcare in the US context, and Shuford has particular  and valuable skills to bring to the table.</p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><i style="">References:<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT">Antony, Louise. 1993.
