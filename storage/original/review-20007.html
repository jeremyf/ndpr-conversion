	 <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="DA">There has been a flurry of publications in the last decade from philosophers,  social psychologists, political theorists, sociologists, and of course,  theologians of various backgrounds concerning the problem of evil. One might account  for a recent uptick in interest in reflecting on this question by pointing to  both the "high-profile" cases of evil, such as 9-11, Abu Ghraib, Darfur, or the sex abuse scandal in the Catholic church, as well as the endless "anonymous" cases of human beings' constant and cruel inhumanity to their fellow beings, human and otherwise, distressingly far too numerous  to name. But citing empirical causes would be far too easy, because the  truth is, the problem of evil has never gone away. In the long epoch of  metaphysics, its meaning and scope was more narrowly defined, perhaps univocal, but today  the "problem of evil" is a bit of a portmanteau. No longer cast in the framework of a theodicy, evil is a distinctly human problem, understood variously as moral character, action, or consequence, and through guises  such as atrocity, wickedness, sin, irrational hatred, terrorism, and crimes  against humanity, to name but a few. We may no longer think it as incarnated in  Smoke Monsters (sorry, fellow LOST fans), but Enlightenment has hardly cured  us of the problem of evil, and Hannah Arendt was prescient when she said that "the problem of evil will be the fundamental question of post-war intellectual life in Europe."<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="DA">So there may well be renewed interest in the problem of evil, but the  problem itself is hardly new. It is as old as philosophy itself, a discourse  which begins, one story goes, with an act of spiritual freedom that allows the  first philosopher to step away from the naïve comfort of the bosom of nature  and ask "why?" The conditions for the possibility of evil are established with this first act of freedom, and indeed, freedom may itself be the  first act of evil, in that it commits a violence against nature, violates nature  by turning it into an object for scientific inquiry and for instrumental  reason. The co-originarity of freedom and evil (arguably what Kant meant by "radical evil") born of our willful separation from nature (as Schelling claims) is not only a philosophical mirror of the theological  story of the Fall, but also and more importantly accounts for why the problem  of evil will not go away: as long as we are free, there is evil -- not simply as  a possibility, but as actuality. Kant, of course, is responding to  Leibniz's notion of Theodicy, itself articulated against Bayle's skeptical  argument against the goodness of God. Long after Kant's response, Nietzsche,  Freud, Arendt, and others will tell a different story about evil that takes us definitively beyond its metaphysical confines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="DA">There are a few excellent texts among those recently published that provide a  superb narrative framework for understanding the problem of evil. Reflections  on evil prior to Theodicy (that is, prior to the debate between Bayle and  Leibniz) typically remain the purview of theology and religious studies. But  among the philosophers, Susan Neiman's magisterial study demonstrates how the  debate over Theodicy informs the development of modern philosophy and the experience  of modernity. Richard Bernstein covers all the major bases, from German  Idealism (Kant, Hegel, Schelling), thorough social psychology (Nietzsche, Freud),  to more contemporary philosophers (Levinas, Jonas, Arendt). Lars Svendsen's  recent book offers a taxonomy of evils and considers how philosophers respond  to them, while Claudia Card's study treats evil as an ethical problem and  suffering and harm as a necessary consequence, then sketches an "atrocity theory," between stoicism and utilitarianism, in order to take account of the  most significant evils of the twentieth century, just as Leibniz had to take  account of the Lisbon earthquake. Most collections of philosophical essays on  the topic cover the same swath of philosophical history, focus on the usual  philosophers, and approach the issue from what I hesitatingly call an "Anglo-American" philosophical perspective (as I wish neither to mischaracterize nor overdetermine the scholarly orientations of the contributuors, nor be perceived as making an ad hominem). "Continental" philosophers have not abundantly published on the topic, though a couple of noteworthy exceptions are Martin Matustik's post-secular meditation on evil and hope, and Alan Schrift's collection  of essays on modernity and evil. There are precious few collections from a psychoanalytic perspective, and even fewer from the domain of critical  legal studies. This is what makes the collection entitled <i style="">Law and  Evil: Philosophy, Politics, Psychoanalysis</i>, edited by Ari Hirvonen and Janne Prottikivi, a different, valuable, and welcome  addition: it tries to respond to these lacks in the literature on the problem of evil  in a single volume.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="DA">The editors' introduction is alone a valuable piece, ably surveying more  than a decade's worth of reflection on the problem of evil from different  academic domains and in different languages. Justifying the collection with the  (somewhat unfair) claim that evil is a concept too often taken as self-evident, as already defined or understood, or as a relic of the bygone era of  ontotheology, the editors bring together essays that try to "give richer and more  thoroughgoing analysis of the multifaceted phenomenon of evil in its ethical,  political, and philosophical ramifications" (p. 5). The fourteen essays in the  collection are shared out into three sections, synonymously corresponding to the  domains named in the book's subtitle. On a critical note, the sections sometimes  feel artificially composed, as if the essays do not naturally belong together  or complement each other (this is especially true in the second section, on "Terror"). Some essays feel as if they were included rather arbitrarily (Françoise Dastur's and Simon Critchley's essays, for example, are both excellent, but feel at first to have but an incidental relation to the collection's thematic, and Dastur's is rather turgidly translated). Some  essays are more obfuscating than clarifying, or assume too much specialized  knowledge without adding any illuminating context (hence a whiff of hermetic scholasticism). But we must remember that this is an edited collection  of essays, and the problems I just mentioned are not uncommon to such  compendia. While I wouldn't count it as a demerit, I do wish there was greater  narrative cohesiveness in this case, if only because the topic is so rich and the explorations so varied. On the other hand, the essays do raise interest  in various aspects of the problem of evil in sometimes unexpected ways, and  if one of the tests for a good collection is that it makes the reader want to  pursue the topic further in dialogue with other writers, then this passes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="DA">The first part of the book, "Freedom," concerns the philosophical approach to the problem of evil focusing on freedom as that which "interrupts" the quiet bliss of wholeness or oneness with nature, casting us out of Eden (Angus McDonald) and forming the basis of tragic  poetry (Dastur). Marcia Sá Cavalcante Schuback's article is an especially  noteworthy contribution -- scholarly, insightful, and eminently readable --  focusing on Schelling and Heidegger, connecting the problem of evil to the ambiguity  of human life. The editors here also include contributions inspired by contemporary French philosophy. As I am not a connoisseur of the work of Jean-Luc Nancy, I found Sami Santanen's piece on wickedness in Nancy  difficult to follow; Jari Kauffinen's essay on "Derrida's philosophy explained through the concept of evil" fares a bit better, but its promising  thesis is perhaps too ambitious in its scope. I'm not sure that Derrida's  philosophy is "explained," but the author does show that the elements for a deconstruction of radical evil are, in different guises, to be found  throughout Derrida's work, and I found myself frequently writing in the margins of  this essay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="DA">The second part of the book, on "Terror," concerns political manifestations of evils. After a critical review of Arendt on the  banality of evil (Jacob Rogozinski), Critchley's essay on "The Catechism of the Citizen" takes up citizenship as the means to cultivate moral and civic virtue, and thus temper the corrupt and evil passions. But as Hirvonen's  piece, a solid example of critical legal scholarship, shows, citizenship  itself, as a function of the law, can itself be utterly infected with evil, as he  evinces through a frightening catalogue of the laws, legislation, and legal  frameworks of the Third Reich (more than any other, I think this essay shows why  the titular terms "Law" and "Evil" belong together and why our vigilance with regard to the law must never wane). Artemy Magun's essay  further erodes the Rousseauist naiveté by showing that if the Enlightenment  subject is governed by self-mastery, then contemporary terrorism is the legacy of a  crisis of autonomy, which he teases out through a reading of <i style="">The  Dispossessed</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="NDPRBodyTexT"><span style="" lang="DA">The final part of the book, "Desire," is devoted to psychoanalytic readings of law and evil. The first two essays are of a  Lacanian-Žižekian inspiration, for which, it must be said, I have little patience, but  each offers a critical perspective on Kantian morality that refers the reader  back to the earlier essays. The third essay is an interesting clinical  perspective focusing, sometimes in very technical ways, on perversion, psychopathy,  and their regulation. But the fourth essay by Véronique Voruz deserves  special mention for its clarity of exposition of the Freudian death drive and  Lacan's interpretation of it, focusing on "Kant with Sade," and revaluing the categorical imperative as a philosophical rationalization of moral  masochism. Of all the essays in the volume, this one is the most clear, accessible,  and instructive, virtues that many other essays regrettably do not possess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <span style="" lang="DA">On the whole, this is an interesting but uneven collection, approaching the  problem of evil from three distinct but complementary discursive positions. Many of  the essays are clear and insightful, but many others are highly specialized  and obfuscating. Still, there's a little something here for everybody, and  even those for whom the problem of evil is not an area of specialization will benefit from essays in this collection. At the very least, readers will  find themselves engaged in a critical dialogue, and will perhaps rediscover,  as I did, the problem of evil through a pluridisciplinary optic. Indeed, "the problem of evil" names a large and diverse field of inquiry, to which  many voices from different disciplines will continue to contribute, and the  greatest virtue of this book is that it opens new avenues of dialogue to this  rich and inexhaustible questioning of evil. It will be a valuable addition to the University  library.</span>
