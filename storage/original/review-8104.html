	<p class="MsoBodyText"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">De Gaynesford takes a second look at what has become the standard view in the philosophy of language: the idea that "I" is a pure indexical, a term having a linguistic meaning determining different referents for different tokens or utterances. The book blends history of philosophy (Descartes, Kant), classic contributions to the semantics of "I" (Russell, Wittgenstein, Anscombe and Strawson) and more recent views (Kaplan).<span style="">  </span>It is also heavily influenced by ordinary language philosophy.<span style="">  </span>Chapter 1 is a brief survey of the role of<span style="">  </span>"I" in the history of philosophy.<span style="">  </span>The first part of the book is mainly dedicated to a presentation and criticism of three contentions the author sees as the orthodoxy. First, <i>Rule Theory </i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(Chapter 2): a rule, like "the speaker of the utterance" or something similar, gives the meaning of "I" and "determines the referent of any use of that term" (p.4); second, <i>Independence </i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(Chapter 3): there is <i>no need to identify the object</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> referred to when uttering "I"; third, <i>The Guarantee </i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">(Chapter 4): an utterance of "I" <i>cannot fail to have a referent</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">.<span style="">  </span>Together, these three stands constitute what he calls <i>Purism</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">.<span style="">  </span>In the second part of the book, a view of "I" as demonstrative is argued for.<span style="">  </span>The positive suggestion does not discard the idea that a rule is at work as far as "I" is concerned.<span style="">  </span>However, it contends that such a rule does not give the meaning of "I", and is not reference determining.<span style="">  </span>It just raises to salience what makes the utterance true.<span style="">  </span>If something like "the speaker of the utterance" does not determine the object referred to by an utterance of<span style="">  </span>"I", then the latter might not be the utterer. On this picture, using "I" requires identification of the object designated.<span style="">  </span>In addition, "I" does not semantically guarantee that the utterance cannot fail to have a referent. However, De Gaynesford rejects the possibility of reference failure and offers what he calls a pragmatic explanation for this feature of<span style="">  </span>"I". Arguing against the very simple ideas backing the orthodoxy requires strong intuitions and clear arguments.<span style="">  </span>The book does not fare very well in this respect.<span style="">  </span>The proposed alternative must be as simple and as plausible as what it replaces.<span style="">  </span>Most semanticists will not be convinced by the suggested view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"><i>Rule theory</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is clearly semantic in nature. <i>The Guarantee</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, on the other hand<i>,</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> has less to do with the idea that a rule gives the meaning of "I", and determines the referent of an utterance of "I", than with the fact that the specific rule we are interested in gives a condition satisfied by a unique speaker, refers to an utterance, and that an utterance is defined by the use of a sentence <i>by a speaker</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, at a place, at a moment of time.<span style="">  </span>If there is an utterance, then there is a speaker -- hence, the close, intuitive semantic relation linking the meaning of "I" to the speaker.<span style="">  </span><i>Independence</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, focusing on identification, is epistemic in nature.<span style="">  </span>In Chapter 1, it is suggested that each doctrine gives the others some support.<span style="">  </span>In my understanding, <i>Rule Theory</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is the key player in semantics, and the two others are just direct consequences of it.<span style="">  </span>De Gaynesford, by putting them together, is less interested in semantic issues than in a nest of philosophical, especially epistemic and metaphysical, problems gravitating around "I".<span style="">   </span><i>Purism</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> brings together semantics and epistemic issues.<span style="">  </span>However, recent philosophical work on "I" keeps them apart.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">The criticisms against <i>Rule Theory</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> are not convincing.<span style="">  </span>De Gaynesford contends that advocates of the <i>Rule Theory</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> offer only a few arguments in favor of their view (p. 30). Kaplan's <i>Demonstratives</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, as well as Perry's early papers, contain many arguments in favor of Direct Reference and <i>Rule Theory</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, arguments not addressed in the book.<span style="">  </span>Kaplan is introduced as a representative of that approach.<span style="">  </span>However, the presentation of Kaplan's view is very brief and not well informed.<span style="">  </span>De Gaynesford sees a problem in the idea that the meaning of "I" is referent determining, since that leaves no room for intentions.<span style="">  </span>But "I" clearly leaves no room for intentions in reference determination.<span style="">  </span>He then examines various rules found in the literature, things like "The producer of the utterance", and argues (p. 40) that a rule like "Uses of "I" refers to those who use them" is ambiguous in three ways.<span style="">  </span>""I" refers to the person using it" would be a better formulation of a plausible rule.<span style="">  </span>Now, I really fail to see these ambiguities in the stated rule and, for example, how the rule might mean something like "for every use of<span style="">  </span>"I" which has a user, the use will successfully refer to the user" (p. 40). Can a use of "I" be without a user?<span style="">  </span>He would also question the use of "producer" in my example, distinguish user and producer, and introduce an ontological issue -- is the producer, or user, a body?<span style="">  </span>a person? a human being? -- and a role issue -- is it the speech writer who wrote the "I" read by a politician? The politician reading it?<span style="">  </span>Or the evil genius controlling his mouth and forcing him to say "I"?<span style="">  </span>He, of course, adds quotation and fictional use of "I", by an actor, for example.<span style="">  </span>I do not see why these are problems for the rule theory since the latter requires only that an object determined by the meaning of "I" makes true an "I"-sentence utterance.<span style="">   </span>In contrast with what is assumed in the book, I do not see "what kinds of thing "I" refers to" (p. 13), as a serious semantic issue. I remain unconvinced that much weight should be put on these examples.<span style="">  </span>There are interesting ontological problems around "I", but I doubt that they are connected to the semantics of "I" and/or can be solved by examining the semantics of "I".<span style="">  </span>The discussion on context (p. 44) focusses on the Answering Machine Paradox.<span style="">  </span>However, the problem is not well introduced and does not echo the sophisticated debates found in the literature (Perry, Predelli). Finally, the book does not address the principle underlying <i>Rule Theory</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">: the idea that a rule, or the linguistic meaning of "I", determines the referent of a token or an utterance of that term, the referent being part of the truth conditions of a token or an utterance of a sentence containing that term.<span style="">  </span>In my understanding this is the essence of Direct Reference Theory.<span style="">  </span>Specific formulations of the rule found in the literature are rightly questioned, but the principle underlying these formulations never is.<span style="">  </span>It is hard to figure out why Chapter 3 is opened by saying that <i>Rule Theory</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is a dead end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">De Gaynesford takes <i>Independence</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">, the doctrine that one need not identify oneself when using "I", to be offered as an explanation for what ordinary language philosophers (basically, Wittgenstein and Strawson) call nonsensical questions, questions like "Are you sure that it is you who is in pain when you say "I am in pain"?"<span style="">  </span>He rejects the doctrine because what it explains is a cloud of examples -- "is not in good order" (p. 61) -- not really requiring <i>Independence</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">.<span style="">  </span>This is a not a convincing argument.<span style="">  </span>I am not sure that the theory is motivated by these examples.<span style="">  </span>In addition, that the problems allegedly motivating the introduction of a theory are unclear does not provide reason to contend that the theory itself is unclear and wrong.<span style="">  </span>A pragmatic explanation is offered to account for these examples: "a convention to ask whether one has got the reference right only when there is, and because there is, an evident possibility or likelihood of one's having the reference wrong" p. 59).<span style="">  </span>This piece of ordinary language philosophy is not a serious alternative to what is a consequence of the semantics of "I".<span style="">  </span>De Gaynesford contends that (i) referring "is a kind of identification" (p. 58), and that (ii) to express a thought about oneself by using an<span style="">  </span>"I"-sentence one must be able to identify oneself (Chapter 3).<span style="">  </span>(i) is not part of the semantics of "I" or the orthodoxy, and the argument behind (ii) is obscure.<span style="">  </span>He also writes that he wants to focus on the meaning of "I", not on the thoughts it expresses.<span style="">  </span>However, he heavily invokes thoughts expressed by utterance of<span style="">  </span>"I"-sentences -- without saying much about such thoughts -- to support the views for which he argues.<span style="">   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">Finally, <i>The Guarantee</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is rejected on different grounds.<span style="">  </span>"Arguments for <i>The Guarantee</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> imply <i>Rule Theory.<span style="">  </span></i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">But the latter doctrine is false, as we know<i>.</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> So the former must fail" (p. 76).<span style="">  </span>At this stage, some readers might not be convinced that the <i>Rule Theory</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is false.<span style="">  </span>De Gaynesford argues that <i>The Guarantee</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> makes some questionable assumptions: "that anyone who speaks will know both that there is a speaker and who that speaker is" (p. 77), for example. Amazingly, <i>The Guaranteee</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> does not mention knowledge, and without new premisses, it does not imply anything with respect to speaker's knowledge.<span style="">  </span>Alternatively, he argues that it relies on the questionable idea that "merely speaking <i>I</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is sufficient to give the use determinate reference" (p. 77).<span style="">  </span>But if an utterance of "I" refers to the speaker of the utterance, it is hard to question that point: there is bound to be a determinate referent, as recognized by De Gaynesford himself.<span style="">  </span>This is the case, whether you call the referent the speaker, the user or the agent.<span style="">  </span>And the reason why there is a referent is that the meaning of "I" is context sensitive and tokens or utterances are bound to be found in contexts where there is a speaker, a user or an agent,.<span style="">  </span>Call it a semantic or a pragmatic feature of "I" if you want.<span style="">  </span>But the link is tighter than an empirical link, and rightly tighter than what salience will ever provide.<span style="">  </span>In addition, you do not want the strong link between an utterance of "I" and its referent to be an empirical coincidence, and you may want the meaning of "I" to have a role to play here. <span style=""> </span>Finally, it is argued that "features of any occasion of utterance ensure that no use of "I" could fail to refer" (p. 80).<span style="">  </span>If this does not mean that features of any utterance of "I" guarantee that an utterance of "I" has a referent, then I am lost.<span style="">  </span>But this is exactly what <i>The Guarantee</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> states. The reader cannot be anything but perplexed when he adds that <i>The Rule Theory</i></span><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;"> is not enough to get a referent, and that pragmatic features must be added (p. 80).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">What is the positive suggestion?<span style="">  </span>A demonstrative or deictic determines a specific referent by making it salient, and more precisely referentially salient, and each act of using a deictic is an act of making an object salient.<span style="">  </span>On that view, "Salience is not relative to observation", and an object might be salient even if not observed (p. 125).<span style="">  </span>According to De Gaynesford, some utterances of demonstratives just don't need a demonstration to make an object salient, as in the example "that tree" in a one-tree world. There might also be a candidate to salience because of previous discourse. So, demonstrations are not necessary features of demonstratives. The former just "help secure the determinacy of reference" (p. 115) of the latter.<span style="">  </span>In the case of "I" as a demonstrative, uttering that term makes the referent salient (p. 130). On that picture, salience plays a very important role, but remains to me an evanescent notion.<span style="">  </span>Now, having a salient object does not imply that this object has been discriminated and/or identified.<span style="">  </span>Chapter 10 is an examination of how an utterer of "I" identifies the object referred to/made salient by his utterance as the object he is really thinking about. This is the main issue in the last chapters of the book.<span style="">  </span>In Chapter 11 we have an answer to that question: some form of perceptual awareness of oneself through proprioception.<span style="">  </span>If one makes an utterance of "I", one knows that one is making this utterance.<span style="">  </span>This chapter is mainly in the philosophy of mind, and includes a long critical discussion of Shoemaker on awareness.<span style="">  </span>De Gaynesford's perspective on "I" downplays reference determination and semantics.<span style="">  </span>It emphasizes identification of the utterer and epistemic issues linked to knowledge of oneself and self-consciousness, and what prompts an utterance of an "I"-sentence.<span style="">  </span>In that respect, it is much closer to philosophy of mind than to semantics, and it brings "I" back to more traditional problems raised by ordinary language philosophers.<span style="">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <span  lang="EN-CA" style="color:black;">This is the first book-length study of "I" adopting a perspective not inspired by Frege.<span style="">  </span>De Gaynesford takes into consideration many different views and examines various issues without relying on recent semantic principles. For this reason, his suggestion will not be convincing for those keen on the Direct Reference Theory framework. It is also sad that the author does not address some very difficult issues raised by demonstratives and<span style="">  </span>indexicals: for example, the fact that "I" is not clearly linked to representations of oneself, how "I" is tied to proprioception and how to report first person thoughts.<span style="">  </span>Even if explicitly not addressing first-person thoughts, De Gaynesford assumes them, and a sketch of his view on that topic would have made his case stronger. Despite all my reservations, I want to emphasize that De Gaynesford's broad philosophical concerns, clearly anchored in ordinary language philosophy and reaching philosophy of mind, are very legitimate and deserve attention.<span style="">  </span>There is much to be learned from this book.<span style="">  </span>It will remind hard-core Direct Reference theorists that the motivations behind their work in semantics go deep into epistemological and metaphysical problems, and that their audience expects them to address these issues.</span>
